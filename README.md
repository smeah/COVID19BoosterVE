Companion repository to the manuscript "Design and Analysis Heterogeneity in Observational Studies of COVID-19 Booster Effectiveness: A Review and Case Study" by Sabir Meah, Xu Shi, Lars G. Fritsche, Maxwell Salvatore, Abram Wagner, Emily T. Martin, and Bhramar Mukherjee.  This repository gives the R code and associated files used in this paper, along with some easier-to-follow examples of the VE analysis methods.

Literature review R code (i.e., to generate the forest plots) and associated data files can be found in the 'Literature Review & Examples' folder.

R code examples of the VE methods used in the paper can be found in the 'Analysis Code Examples' folder.

Actual R code used in the Michigan Medicine data analysis can be found in the 'MM Analysis Code' folder.  
Note that the actual data is not available to the public for privacy reasons.  Thus, several lines of code loading the data with their specific file paths are also omitted.
