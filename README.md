Companion repository to the manuscript "Design and Analysis Heterogeneity in Observational Studies of COVID-19 Booster Effectiveness: A Review and Case Study" by Sabir Meah, Xu Shi, Lars G. Fritsche, Maxwell Salvatore, Abram Wagner, Emily T. Martin, and Bhramar Mukherjee.  This repository gives the R code and associated files used in this paper, along with some easier-to-follow examples of the VE analysis methods applied to basic simulated data.

Literature review R code (i.e., to generate the forest plots) and associated data files (i.e., collated summary data underlying such forest plots) can be found in the 'Literature Review & Examples' folder.

R code examples of the VE methods used in the paper (applied on some very basic simulated data) can be found in the 'Analysis Code Examples' folder.

Actual R code used in the Michigan Medicine (MM) data analysis can be found in the 'MM Analysis Code' folder.  
Note that the data used with this code cannot be shared publicly due to institutional policies around patient confidentiality and privacy concerns.  The data, which was not collected by our team or as part of any other study, was curated from the electronic medical records and patient encounters at Michigan Medicine and made available through the University of Michigan Precision Health Analytics Platform.  This data is available upon request from the University of Michigan Precision Health Analytics Platform at https://precisionhealth.umich.edu/tools-resources/data-access-tools/ for researchers who meet the criteria for access to confidential data and requires Institutional Review Board approval at their own institution and at Michigan.

Note that the repository as of the final commit 7-17-2023 matches the materials used in the MedRxiv preprint, there have been slight edits to figures and associated code since (but not to the core MM analysis or literature review data files).  This repository has also been published on Zenodo with a citeable DOI (please see Releases for versions that match Zenodo repositiories, or the badge above for the Zenodo page for the most recent release).
