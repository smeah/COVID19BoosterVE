Data are needed regarding the effect of the  booster dose on the rate of confirmed coronavirus 2019 disease (Covid-19) and the  rate of severe illness. METHODS: We extracted data for the period from July 30  through August 31, 2021, from the Israeli Ministry of Health database regarding  1,137,804 persons who were 60 years of age or older and had been fully vaccinated  (i.e., had received two doses of BNT162b2) at least 5 months earlier. In the  primary analysis, we compared the rate of confirmed Covid-19 and the rate of  severe illness between those who had received a booster injection at least 12  days earlier (booster group) and those who had not received a booster injection  (nonbooster group). In a secondary analysis, we evaluated the rate of infection 4  to 6 days after the booster dose as compared with the rate at least 12 days after  the booster. In all the analyses, we used Poisson regression after adjusting for  possible confounding factors. RESULTS: At least 12 days after the booster dose,  the rate of confirmed infection was lower in the booster group than in the  nonbooster group by a factor of 11.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.4 to  12.3); the rate of severe illness was lower by a factor of 19.5 (95% CI, 12.9 to  29.5). In a secondary analysis, the rate of confirmed infection at least 12 days  after vaccination was lower than the rate after 4 to 6 days by a factor of 5.4  (95% CI, 4.8 to 6.1). CONCLUSIONS: In this study involving participants who were  60 years of age or older and had received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine at  least 5 months earlier, we found that the rates of confirmed Covid-19 and severe  illness were substantially lower among those who received a booster (third) dose  of the BNT162b2 vaccine.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""}",10.1056/NEJMoa2114255,"*COVID-19 Vaccines;*Immunization, Secondary;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;BNT162 Vaccine;COVID-19/epidemiology/*prevention & control;Databases, Factual;Female;Humans;Israel/epidemiology;Male;Middle Aged;Patient Acuity;Poisson Distribution;SARS-CoV-2;Israel;Vaccination;Vaccines",,,1137804

In response, these  countries are considering the administration of a third dose of mRNA COVID-19  vaccine as a booster dose to address potential waning immunity over time and  reduced effectiveness against the delta variant. We aimed to use the data  repositories of Israel's largest health-care organisation to evaluate the  effectiveness of a third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine for preventing severe  COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: Using data from Clalit Health Services, which  provides mandatory health-care coverage for over half of the Israeli population,  individuals receiving a third vaccine dose between July 30, 2020, and Sept 23,  2021, were matched (1:1) to demographically and clinically similar controls who  did not receive a third dose. Eligible participants had received the second  vaccine dose at least 5 months before the recruitment date, had no previous  documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, and had no contact with the health-care system  in the 3 days before recruitment. Individuals who are health-care workers, live  in long-term care facilities, or are medically confined to their homes were  excluded. Primary outcomes were COVID-19-related admission to hospital, severe  disease, and COVID-19-related death. The third dose effectiveness for each  outcome was estimated as 1 - risk ratio using the Kaplan-Meier estimator.  FINDINGS: 1 158 269 individuals were eligible to be included in the third dose  group. Following matching, the third dose and control groups each included  728 321 individuals. Participants had a median age of 52 years (IQR 37-68) and  51% were female. The median follow-up time was 13 days (IQR 6-21) in both groups.  Vaccine effectiveness evaluated at least 7 days after receipt of the third dose,  compared with receiving only two doses at least 5 months ago, was estimated to be  93% (231 events for two doses vs 29 events for three doses; 95% CI 88-97) for  admission to hospital, 92% (157 vs 17 events; 82-97) for severe disease, and 81%  (44 vs seven events; 59-97) for COVID-19-related death. INTERPRETATION: Our  findings suggest that a third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is effective in  protecting individuals against severe COVID-19-related outcomes, compared with  receiving only two doses at least 5 months ago.

On July 30,  2021, the Israeli Ministry of Health approved the use of a third dose of BNT162b2  (booster) to cope with this resurgence. Evidence regarding the effectiveness of  the booster in lowering mortality due to Covid-19 is still needed. METHODS: We  obtained data for all members of Clalit Health Services who were 50 years of age  or older at the start of the study and had received two doses of BNT162b2 at  least 5 months earlier. The mortality due to Covid-19 among participants who  received the booster during the study period (booster group) was compared with  that among participants who did not receive the booster (nonbooster group). A Cox  proportional-hazards regression model with time-dependent covariates was used to  estimate the association of booster status with death due to Covid-19, with  adjustment for sociodemographic factors and coexisting conditions. RESULTS: A  total of 843,208 participants met the eligibility criteria, of whom 758,118 (90%)  received the booster during the 54-day study period. Death due to Covid-19  occurred in 65 participants in the booster group (0.16 per 100,000 persons per  day) and in 137 participants in the nonbooster group (2.98 per 100,000 persons  per day). The adjusted hazard ratio for death due to Covid-19 in the booster  group, as compared with the nonbooster group, was 0.10 (95% confidence interval,  0.07 to 0.14; P<0.001).

METHODS: We extracted data for the period from July 30 to October 10,  2021, from the Israel Ministry of Health database regarding 4,696,865 persons 16  years of age or older who had received two doses of BNT162b2 at least 5 months  earlier. In the primary analysis, we compared the rates of confirmed coronavirus  disease 2019 (Covid-19), severe illness, and death among those who had received a  booster dose at least 12 days earlier (booster group) with the rates among those  who had not received a booster (nonbooster group). In a secondary analysis, we  compared the rates in the booster group with the rates among those who had  received a booster 3 to 7 days earlier (early postbooster group). We used Poisson  regression models to estimate rate ratios after adjusting for possible  confounding factors. RESULTS: The rate of confirmed infection was lower in the  booster group than in the nonbooster group by a factor of approximately 10 (range  across five age groups, 9.0 to 17.2) and was lower in the booster group than in  the early postbooster group by a factor of 4.9 to 10.8. The adjusted rate  difference ranged from 57.0 to 89.5 infections per 100,000 person-days in the  primary analysis and from 34.4 to 38.3 in the secondary analysis. The rates of  severe illness in the primary and secondary analyses were lower in the booster  group by a factor of 17.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.1 to 21.2) and 6.5  (95% CI, 5.1 to 8.2), respectively, among those 60 years of age or older and by a  factor of 21.7 (95% CI, 10.6 to 44.2) and 3.7 (95% CI, 1.3 to 10.2) among those  40 to 59 years of age.

Data are needed regarding  the effect of the fourth dose on rates of confirmed severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and of severe coronavirus disease  2019 (Covid-19). METHODS: Using the Israeli Ministry of Health database, we  extracted data on 1,252,331 persons who were 60 years of age or older and  eligible for the fourth dose during a period in which the B.1.1.529 (omicron)  variant of SARS-CoV-2 was predominant (January 10 through March 2, 2022). We  estimated the rate of confirmed infection and severe Covid-19 as a function of  time starting at 8 days after receipt of a fourth dose (four-dose groups) as  compared with that among persons who had received only three doses (three-dose  group) and among persons who had received a fourth dose 3 to 7 days earlier  (internal control group). For the estimation of rates, we used quasi-Poisson  regression with adjustment for age, sex, demographic group, and calendar day.  RESULTS: The number of cases of severe Covid-19 per 100,000 person-days  (unadjusted rate) was 1.5 in the aggregated four-dose groups, 3.9 in the  three-dose group, and 4.2 in the internal control group. In the quasi-Poisson  analysis, the adjusted rate of severe Covid-19 in the fourth week after receipt  of the fourth dose was lower than that in the three-dose group by a factor of 3.5  (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7 to 4.6) and was lower than that in the  internal control group by a factor of 2.3 (95% CI, 1.7 to 3.3). Protection  against severe illness did not wane during the 6 weeks after receipt of the  fourth dose. The number of cases of confirmed infection per 100,000 person-days  (unadjusted rate) was 177 in the aggregated four-dose groups, 361 in the  three-dose group, and 388 in the internal control group. In the quasi-Poisson  analysis, the adjusted rate of confirmed infection in the fourth week after  receipt of the fourth dose was lower than that in the three-dose group by a  factor of 2.0 (95% CI, 1.9 to 2.1) and was lower than that in the internal  control group by a factor of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.7 to 1.9). However, this protection  waned in later weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and  severe Covid-19 were lower after a fourth dose of BNT162b2 vaccine than after  only three doses. Protection against confirmed infection appeared short-lived,  whereas protection against severe illness did not wane during the study period.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""}",10.1056/NEJMoa2201570,BNT162 Vaccine;Humans;Israel/epidemiology;*SARS-CoV-2;*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines;Israel,,,1252331

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between receipt of 3 doses of  Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 or Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2  infection, stratified by variant (Omicron and Delta). DESIGN, SETTING, AND  PARTICIPANTS: A test-negative case-control analysis among adults 18 years or  older with COVID-like illness tested December 10, 2021, through January 1, 2022,  by a national pharmacy-based testing program (4666 COVID-19 testing sites across  49 US states). EXPOSURES: Three doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (third dose ≥14  days before test and ≥6 months after second dose) vs unvaccinated and vs 2 doses  6 months or more before test (ie, eligible for a booster dose). MAIN OUTCOMES AND  MEASURES: Association between symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (stratified by  Omicron or Delta variants defined using S-gene target failure) and vaccination (3  doses vs unvaccinated and 3 doses vs 2 doses). Associations were measured with  multivariable multinomial regression. Among cases, a secondary outcome was median  cycle threshold values (inversely proportional to the amount of target nucleic  acid present) for 3 viral genes, stratified by variant and vaccination status.  RESULTS: Overall, 23 391 cases (13 098 Omicron; 10 293 Delta) and 46 764 controls  were included (mean age, 40.3 [SD, 15.6] years; 42 050 [60.1%] women). Prior  receipt of 3 mRNA vaccine doses was reported for 18.6% (n = 2441) of Omicron  cases, 6.6% (n = 679) of Delta cases, and 39.7% (n = 18 587) of controls; prior  receipt of 2 mRNA vaccine doses was reported for 55.3% (n = 7245), 44.4%  (n = 4570), and 41.6% (n = 19 456), respectively; and being unvaccinated was  reported for 26.0% (n = 3412), 49.0% (n = 5044), and 18.6% (n = 8721),  respectively. The adjusted odds ratio for 3 doses vs unvaccinated was 0.33 (95%  CI, 0.31-0.35) for Omicron and 0.065 (95% CI, 0.059-0.071) for Delta; for 3  vaccine doses vs 2 doses the adjusted odds ratio was 0.34 (95% CI, 0.32-0.36) for  Omicron and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.14-0.17) for Delta. Median cycle threshold values  were significantly higher in cases with 3 doses vs 2 doses for both Omicron and  Delta (Omicron N gene: 19.35 vs 18.52; Omicron ORF1ab gene: 19.25 vs 18.40; Delta  N gene: 19.07 vs 17.52; Delta ORF1ab gene: 18.70 vs 17.28; Delta S gene: 23.62 vs  20.24). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among individuals seeking testing for  COVID-like illness in the US in December 2021, receipt of 3 doses of mRNA  COVID-19 vaccine (compared with unvaccinated and with receipt of 2 doses) was  less likely among cases with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with  test-negative controls. These findings suggest that receipt of 3 doses of mRNA  vaccine, relative to being unvaccinated and to receipt of 2 doses, was associated  with protection against both the Omicron and Delta variants, although the higher  odds ratios for Omicron suggest less protection for Omicron than for Delta.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""}",10.1001/jama.2022.0470,"Aged;Humans;Middle Aged;*Vaccine Efficacy;Adult;COVID-19/epidemiology/*prevention & control/virology;Adolescent;Young Adult;*SARS-CoV-2;BNT162 Vaccine/*administration & dosage;Retrospective Studies;Immunization, Secondary;COVID-19 Vaccines/*administration & dosage;Case-Control Studies;2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273/*administration & dosage;Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic;Odds Ratio;Regression Analysis;Risk Factors;Vaccination;RNA, Messenger",,,70155

METHODS: To evaluate the early effectiveness of a  fourth dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine for the prevention of Covid-19-related  outcomes, we analyzed data recorded by the largest health care organization in  Israel from January 3 to February 18, 2022. We evaluated the relative  effectiveness of a fourth vaccine dose as compared with that of a third dose  given at least 4 months earlier among persons 60 years of age or older. We  compared outcomes in persons who had received a fourth dose with those in persons  who had not, individually matching persons from these two groups with respect to  multiple sociodemographic and clinical variables.

Protection conferred by booster doses of  the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines in Qatar, as  compared with protection conferred by the two-dose primary series, is unclear.  METHODS: We conducted two matched retrospective cohort studies to assess the  effectiveness of booster vaccination, as compared with that of a two-dose primary  series alone, against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and Covid-19-related  hospitalization and death during a large wave of omicron infections from December  19, 2021, through January 26, 2022. The association of booster status with  infection was estimated with the use of Cox proportional-hazards regression  models. RESULTS: In a population of 2,239,193 persons who had received at least  two doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine, those who had also received a booster  were matched with persons who had not received a booster. Among the  BNT162b2-vaccinated persons, the cumulative incidence of symptomatic omicron  infection was 2.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3 to 2.5) in the booster  cohort and 4.5% (95% CI, 4.3 to 4.6) in the nonbooster cohort after 35 days of  follow-up. Booster effectiveness against symptomatic omicron infection, as  compared with that of the primary series, was 49.4% (95% CI, 47.1 to 51.6).  Booster effectiveness against Covid-19-related hospitalization and death due to  omicron infection, as compared with the primary series, was 76.5% (95% CI, 55.9  to 87.5). BNT162b2 booster effectiveness against symptomatic infection with the  delta (or B.1.617.2) variant, as compared with the primary series, was 86.1% (95%  CI, 67.3 to 94.1). Among the mRNA-1273-vaccinated persons, the cumulative  incidence of symptomatic omicron infection was 1.0% (95% CI, 0.9 to 1.2) in the  booster cohort and 1.9% (95% CI, 1.8 to 2.1) in the nonbooster cohort after 35  days; booster effectiveness against symptomatic omicron infection, as compared  with the primary series, was 47.3% (95% CI, 40.7 to 53.3). Few severe Covid-19  cases were noted in the mRNA-1273-vaccinated cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The messenger  RNA (mRNA) boosters were highly effective against symptomatic delta infection,  but they were less effective against symptomatic omicron infection. However, with  both variants, mRNA boosters led to strong protection against Covid-19-related  hospitalization and death.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association of a BNT162b2 booster dose with SARS-CoV-2  infections among health care workers who were previously vaccinated with a 2-dose  series of BNT162b2. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a prospective  cohort study conducted at a tertiary medical center in Tel Aviv, Israel. The  study cohort included 1928 immunocompetent health care workers who were  previously vaccinated with a 2-dose series of BNT162b2, and had enrolled between  August 8 and 19, 2021, with final follow-up reported through September 20, 2021.  Screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed every 14 days. Anti-spike  protein receptor binding domain IgG titers were determined at baseline and 1  month after enrollment. Cox regression with time-dependent analysis was used to  estimate hazard ratios of SARS-CoV-2 infection between booster-immunized status  and 2-dose vaccinated (booster-nonimmunized) status. EXPOSURES: Vaccination with  a booster dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary  outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, as confirmed by reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Among 1928 participants, the  median age was 44 years (IQR, 36-52 years) and 1381 were women (71.6%).  Participants completed the 2-dose vaccination series a median of 210 days (IQR,  205-213 days) before study enrollment. A total of 1650 participants (85.6%)  received the booster dose. During a median follow-up of 39 days (IQR, 35-41  days), SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 44 participants (incidence rate, 60.2 per  100 000 person-days); 31 (70.5%) were symptomatic. Five SARS-CoV-2 infections  occurred in booster-immunized participants and 39 in booster-nonimmunized  participants (incidence rate, 12.8 vs 116 per 100 000 person-days, respectively).  In a time-dependent Cox regression analysis, the adjusted hazard ratio of  SARS-CoV-2 infection for booster-immunized vs booster-nonimmunized participants  was 0.07 (95% CI, 0.02-0.20). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among health care  workers at a single center in Israel who were previously vaccinated with a 2-dose  series of BNT162b2, administration of a booster dose compared with not receiving  one was associated with a significantly lower rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection over a  median of 39 days of follow-up.

The aim of this study was to  estimate the effectiveness of mRNA-based vaccine boosters (third dose) against  infection with the omicron variant by age, sex, time since complete vaccination,  type of primary vaccine, and type of booster. METHODS: In this nationwide cohort  study, we linked data from three nationwide population registries in Spain  (Vaccination Registry, Laboratory Results Registry, and National Health System  registry) to select community-dwelling individuals aged 40 years or older, who  completed their primary vaccine schedule at least 3 months before the start of  follow-up, and had not tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 since the start of the  pandemic. On each day between Jan 3, and Feb 6, 2022, we matched individuals who  received a booster mRNA vaccine and controls of the same sex, age group, postal  code, type of vaccine, time since primary vaccination, and number of previous  tests. We estimated risk of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection using the  Kaplan-Meier method and compared groups using risk ratios (RR) and risk  differences. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as one minus RR. FINDINGS:  Between Jan 3, and Feb 6, 2022, 3 111 159 matched pairs were included in our  study. Overall, the estimated effectiveness from day 7 to 34 after a booster was  51·3% (95% CI 50·2-52·4). Estimated effectiveness was 52·5% (51·3-53·7) for an  mRNA-1273 booster and 46·2% (43·5-48·7) for a BNT162b2 booster. Effectiveness was  58·6% (55·5-61·6) if primary vaccination had been with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  (Oxford-AstraZeneca), 55·3% (52·3-58·2) with mRNA-1273 (Moderna), 49·7%  (48·3-51·1) with BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), and 48·0% (42·5-53·7) with  Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen). Estimated effectiveness was 43·6% (40·0-47·1) when the  booster was administered between 151 days and 180 days after complete vaccination  and 52·2% (51·0-53·3) if administered more than 180 days after primary scheduled  completion. INTERPRETATION: Booster mRNA vaccine-doses were moderately effective  in preventing infection with the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 for over a month  after administration, which indicates their suitability as a strategy to limit  the health effects of COVID-19 in periods of omicron variant domination.

Estimated booster  effectiveness, defined as the relative incidence-rate reduction of severe disease  (supplemental oxygen, intensive care, or death) or confirmed infection following  3-dose vaccination compared with 5 months after second mRNA dose, was determined  using binomial regression. RESULTS: Among 2 441 581 eligible individuals  (1 279 047 [52.4%] women, 846 110 (34.7%) aged 60 years and older), there were  319 943 (13.1%) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, of which 1513 (0.4%) were severe  COVID-19 cases. mRNA booster effectiveness against confirmed infection 15 to 60  days after boosting was estimated to range from 31.7% to 41.3% for the 4 boosting  combinations (homologous BNT162b2, homologous mRNA-1273, 2-dose  BNT162b2/mRNA-1273 booster, and 2-dose mRNA-1273/BNT162b2 booster).

In the United States, as of November 19, 2021,  boosters were recommended for all adults aged 18 years and older. We evaluated  the effectiveness of a third dose of BNT162b2 among adults in a large US  integrated health system. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we  analyzed electronic health records from Kaiser Permanente Southern California  between Dec 14, 2020 and Dec 5, 2021 to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) of two  and three doses of BNT162b2 against SARS-CoV-2 infections (without hospital  admission) andCOVID-19-related hospital admission. VE was calculated using  hazards ratios from adjusted Cox models. FINDINGS: After only two doses, VE  against infection declined from 85% (95% CI 83-86) during the first month to 49%  (46-51) ≥ 7 months following vaccination. Overall VE against hospitalization was  90% (95% CI 86-92) within one month and did not wane, however, effectiveness  against hospitalization appeared to wane among immunocompromised individuals but  was not statistically significant (93% [72-98] at 1 month to 74% [45-88] after  ≥ 7 months; p=0·490). Three-dose VE (median follow-up 1·3 months [SD 0·6]) was  88% (95% CI 86-89) against infection and 97% (95-98) against hospitalization.  Effectiveness after three doses was higher than that seen one month after  receiving only two doses for both outcomes. Relative VE of three doses compared  to two (with at least six months after the second dose) was 75% (95% CI 71-78)  against infections and 70% (48-83) against hospital admissions. INTERPRETATION:  These data support the benefit of broad BNT162b2 booster recommendations, as  three doses confers comparable, if not better, protection against SARS-CoV-2  infections and hospital admission as was seen soon after receiving two doses.

METHODS: Two matched cohorts  were formed using Swedish nationwide registers. In the first, residents of  long-term care facilities (LTCFs) given a fourth dose of an mRNA vaccine from 1  January 2022 onwards were matched 1:1 on birth year and county of residence to  residents given at least a third dose (N = 24,524). In the second, all  individuals aged ≥80 years given a fourth dose were matched 1:1 to individuals  given at least a third dose (N = 394,104). Cox regression models were used to  estimate hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in fourth-dose recipients as  compared with in third-dose recipients, with relative vaccine effectiveness (VE)  estimated as 1 minus the hazard ratio. FINDINGS: From 7 days after baseline and  onwards, there were 1119 deaths in the LTCF cohort during a median follow-up of  77 days and a maximum follow-up of 126 days.

The respective adjusted HRs were 0.07 (95% CI, 0.03-0.14) and 0.10  (95% CI, 0.04-0.24) for the associations of vaccination with the third dose with  hospitalization for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and severe illness. Five  COVID-19-related deaths occurred among the third dose vaccinees during the  follow-up period compared with 22 among the 2-dose-only vaccinees (cumulative  rate: 0.04% vs 0.9%; adjusted HR, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.009-0.16]). CONCLUSIONS AND  RELEVANCE: This cohort study found significant inverse associations between  vaccination with the third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine with overall SARS-CoV-2  infection, COVID-19 hospitalizations, severe disease, and COVID-19-related deaths  among LTCF residents during a massive surge caused by the Delta variant in  Israel.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""}",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.19940,BNT162 Vaccine;Female;Humans;Male;SARS-CoV-2;*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines;Cohort Studies;Hospitalization;Incidence;*Vaccines;Long-Term Care;Vaccination,,,18611

We aimed to investigate the severity of omicron and the extent to which booster  vaccines are effective in preventing symptomatic infection. METHODS: In this  study, using the Scotland-wide Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced  Surveillance of COVID-19 (EAVE II) platform, we did a cohort analysis with a  nested test-negative design incident case-control study covering the period Nov  1-Dec 19, 2021, to provide initial estimates of omicron severity and the  effectiveness of vaccine boosters against symptomatic disease relative to 25  weeks or more after the second vaccine dose. Primary care data derived from 940  general practices across Scotland were linked to laboratory data and hospital  admission data. We compared outcomes between infection with the delta VOC  (defined as S-gene positive) and the omicron VOC (defined as S-gene negative). We  assessed effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, with infection  confirmed through a positive RT-PCR. FINDINGS: By Dec 19, 2021, there were 23 840  S-gene-negative cases in Scotland, which were predominantly among those aged  20-39 years (11 732 [49·2%]). The proportion of S-gene-negative cases that were  possible reinfections was more than ten times that of S-gene-positive cases (7·6%  vs 0·7%; p<0·0001). There were 15 hospital admissions in S-gene-negative  individuals, giving an adjusted observed-to-expected admissions ratio of 0·32  (95% CI 0·19-0·52). The booster vaccine dose was associated with a 57% (54-60)  reduction in the risk of symptomatic S-gene-negative infection relative to  individuals who tested positive 25 weeks or more after the second vaccine dose.  INTERPRETATION: These early national data suggest that omicron is associated with  a two-thirds reduction in the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation compared with  delta. Although offering the greatest protection against delta, the booster dose  of vaccination offers substantial additional protection against the risk of  symptomatic COVID-19 for omicron compared with 25 weeks or more after the second  vaccine dose.

Objective: To determine mRNA booster vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization and death in the omicron era by type of booster, type of primary vaccine, time since primary vaccine, age and comorbidity burden. Design: Target trial emulation study comparing booster vaccination versus no booster. Setting: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system Participants and Intervention: Among persons who had received two mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses at least 5 months earlier, we designed this retrospective matched cohort study to emulate a target trial of booster mRNA vaccination (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) versus no booster, conducted from 12/01/2021 to 03/31/2022. Measurements: Booster VE. Results: Each group included 490,838 well-matched persons, predominantly male (88%), mean age 63.0±14.0 years, followed for up to 121 days (mean 79.8 days). Booster VE >10 days after booster was 42.3% (95% CI 40.6-43.9) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 53.3% (48.1-58.0) against SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization and 79.1% (71.2-84.9) against SARSCoV-2-related death. Booster VE was similar for different booster types (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273), age groups or primary vaccination regimens, but was significantly higher with longer time since primary vaccination and with higher comorbidity burden. Limitations: Predominantly male population. Conclusions: Booster mRNA vaccination was highly effective in preventing death and moderately effective in preventing infection and hospitalization for up to 4 months after administration in the omicron era. Increased uptake of booster vaccination, which is currently suboptimal, should be pursued to limit the morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in persons with high comorbidity burden.

The BNT162b2 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was used initially, with Moderna mRNA-1273 subsequently also used. Methods We used the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, covering 40% of English primary care practices and linked to national coronavirus surveillance, hospital episodes, and death registry data, to estimate the effectiveness of boosting with BNT162b2 compared with no boosting in eligible adults who had received two primary course vaccine doses between 16 September and 16 December 2021 when the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 was dominant. Follow up was for up to 10 weeks. Each booster recipient was matched with an unboosted control on factors relating to booster priority status and prior immunisation. Additional factors were adjusted for in Cox models estimating hazard ratios (HRs). Outcomes were positive SARSCoV-2 test, COVID-19 hospitalisation, COVID-19 death and non-COVID-9 death. Booster vaccine effectiveness was defined as 1−HR. Results Among 4,352,417 BNT162b2 booster recipients matched with unboosted controls, estimated effectiveness of a booster dose compared with two doses only was 50.7% (95% CI 50.1-51.3) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 80.1% (78.3-81.8) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 88.5% (85.0-91.1) for COVID-19 death, and 80.3% (79.0-81.5) for non-COVID-19 death. Estimated effectiveness was similar among those who had received a BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1-S two-dose primary vaccination course, but effectiveness against severe COVID-19 was slightly lower in those classified as clinically extremely vulnerable (76.3% (73.1-79.1) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, and 85.1% (79.6-89.1) for COVID-19 death). Estimated effectiveness against each outcome was lower in those aged 18-65 years than in those aged 65 and over.

Objective: To estimate the effectiveness of primary (two-dose) and booster (third dose) vaccination against Omicron infection among people with a prior documented infection. Design: Test-negative case-control study. Setting: Yale New Haven Health System facilities. Participants: Vaccine eligible people who received SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing between November 1, 2021, and January 31, 2022. Measurements: We conducted two analyses, each with an outcome of Omicron BA.1 infection (S-gene target failure defined) and each stratified by prior SARS-CoV-2 infection status. We estimated the effectiveness of primary and booster vaccination. To test whether booster vaccination reduced the risk of infection beyond that of the primary series, we compared the odds among boosted and booster eligible people. Results: Overall, 10,676 cases and 119,397 controls were included (6.1% and 7.8% occurred following a prior infection, respectively). The effectiveness of primary vaccination 14-149 days after 2nd dose was 36.1% (CI, 7.1% to 56.1%) for people with and 28.5% (CI, 20.0% to 36.2%) without prior infection. The odds ratio comparing boosted and booster eligible people with prior infection was 0.83 (CI, 0.56 to 1.23), whereas the odds ratio comparing boosted and booster eligible people without prior infection was 0.51 (CI, 0.46 to 0.56). Limitations: Misclassification, residual confounding, reliance on TaqPath assay analyzed samples. Conclusion: While primary vaccination provided protection against BA.1 infection among people with and without prior infection, booster vaccination was only associated with additional protection in people without prior infection. These findings support primary vaccination in people regardless of prior infection status but suggest that infection history should be considered when evaluating the need for booster vaccination.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""}",10.1101/2022.04.19.22274056,"vaccine;coronavirus disease 2019;human;nonhuman;revaccination;adult;controlled study;drug therapy;messenger RNA;SARS-CoV-2 Omicron;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;female;major clinical study;male;case control study;outcome assessment;treatment failure;RNA, Messenger;Vaccination",,,130073

Ninety percent of the Israeli adults, including most healthcare workers (HCWs), received three doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine until September 2021. Following the success and safety of the 3rd dose in preventing infection and severe disease, on December 30, 2021, the Israeli Ministry of Health recommended a voluntary 4th vaccine dose to adults above 60 years, immunocompromised, and HCWs. We compared breakthrough infections in HCWs, between 3 and 4-dose recipients. Hospitals collected data on personnel vaccinations and infections dates. The study cohort included all HCWs in eleven hospitals in Israel, who have been vaccinated with three doses up to September 30, 2021, and had not contracted COVID-19 before the vaccination campaign (January 2, 2022). We calculated breakthrough infection rates in 4-dose recipients (more than six days after vaccination) vs. 3-dose recipients. Rate-ratios were calculated for the entire cohort and for subgroups (hospital, sex, age-groups, and profession). Additionally, we repeated the calculations on 4-dose and 3-dose recipients who received the 3rd dose on the same date and were matched for sex, age group, profession and hospital. We generated time-dependent Cox-regression models to account for 4th dose administration timing (Supplement). There were 29,612 HCWs who received 3 vaccine doses between August and September 2021; of these, 5,331 (18.0%) received the 4th dose during January 2022 and were not infected by the first week after vaccination. Overall breakthrough infection rates in the 4-dose and 3-dose groups were 368/5331 (6.9%) and 4802/24280 (19.8%), respectively. The RR (95%CI) was 0.35 (0.32 to 0.39) for crude analysis, and 0.61 (0.54 to 0.71) in the matched analysis. The adjusted HR in the Cox-regression model was 0.56 (0.50 to 0.63). In both groups, severe disease and death were not reported. Our data shows that the 4th BNT162b2 dose resulted in reduced breakthrough infection rates among HCWs. This reduction, similar to the findings in the Israeli elderly population, is lower than that observed after the 3rd dose. Nevertheless, considering the high infectivity of the Omicron variant, which led to critical medical staff shortages, a 4th vaccine dose should be considered to mitigate the infection rate among HCWs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""}",10.1101/2022.04.11.22273327,Israel;breakthrough infection;coronavirus disease 2019;health care personnel;human;tozinameran;vaccination;aged;female;male;cohort analysis;case report;clinical article;groups by age;bnt 162 vaccine;calculation;infection rate;Israeli;medical staff;occupation;Cohort Studies;Vaccination,,,29612

Booster vaccines were offered with one or two doses for the vulnerable population during these periods. Methods and Findings: The nationwide HUN-VE 2 study examined the effectiveness of primary immunization, single booster, and double booster vaccination in the prevention of Covid-19 related mortality during the Delta and Omicron waves, compared to an unvaccinated control population without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection during the same study periods. The risk of Covid-19 related death was 55% lower during the Omicron vs. Delta wave in the whole study population (n=9,569,648 and n=9,581,927, respectively; rate ratio [RR]: 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44–0.48). During the Delta wave, the risk of Covid-19 related death was 74% lower in the primary immunized population (RR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.25–0.28) and 96% lower in the booster immunized population (RR: 0.04; 95% CI: 0.04–0.05), vs. the unvaccinated control group. During the Omicron wave, the risk of Covid-19 related death was 40% lower in the primary immunized population (RR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.55–0.65) and 82% lower in the booster immunized population (RR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.16–0.2) vs. the unvaccinated control group.

The benefit of the second booster was slightly more pronounced in older age groups. Conclusions: The HUN-VE 2 study demonstrated the significantly lower risk of Covid-19 related mortality associated with the Omicron vs. Delta variant and confirmed the benefit of single and double booster vaccination against Covid-19 related death.

Observational studies that estimate effectiveness by comparing outcomes among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals may suffer from residual confounding and exposure misclassification. Objective: To estimate relative effectiveness of booster vaccination versus the 2-dose primary series with self-controlled study design Design, Setting and Participants: We used the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Corporate Data Warehouse to identify U.S. Veterans enrolled in care ≥2 years who received the 2-dose primary mRNA Covid-19 vaccine series and a mRNA Covid-19 booster following expanded recommendation for booster vaccination, and who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test during the Delta (9/23/2021-11/30/2021) or Omicron (1/1/22-3/1/22) predominant period. Among them, we conducted a self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) analysis to compare odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection during a booster exposure interval versus a control interval. Exposures: control interval (days 4-6 post-booster vaccination, presumably prior to gain of booster immunity), and booster exposure interval (days 14-16 post-booster vaccination, presumably following gain of booster immunity) Outcomes and Measures: Positive PCR or antigen SARS-CoV-2 test. Separately for Delta and Omicron periods, we used conditional logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR) of a positive test for the booster versus control interval and calculated relative effectiveness of booster versus 2-dose primary series as (1-OR)*100. The SCRI approach implicitly controlled for time-fixed confounders. Results: We found 42 individuals with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in the control interval and 14 in the booster exposure interval during Delta period, and 137 and 66, respectively, in Omicron period. For the booster versus 2-dose primary series, the odds of infection were 70% (95%CI: 42%, 84%) lower during the Delta period and 56% (95%CI: 38%, 67%) lower during Omicron.

We sought to estimate the impact of COVID-19 booster doses on SARS-CoV-2 infection in a vaccinated and actively surveilled population of young adults during an Omicron-predominant period. Methods and Findings: We implemented a cohort study of young adults in a college environment (Cornell University’s Ithaca campus) from December 5, 2021 through December 31, 2021 when Omicron was deemed the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant on campus. Participants included 15,102 university students fully vaccinated with an FDA-authorized or approved vaccination (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or Ad26.COV2.S) who were enrolled in mandatory at-least-weekly surveillance PCR testing, and having no positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test within 90 days before the start of the study period. Multivariable logistic regression considering those with full vaccination (a 2-dose series of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, or 1 dose of Ad26.COV2.S) with a booster dose versus those without a booster dose. 1,870 SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified in the study population. Controlling for gender, student group membership, full vaccination date and initial vaccine type, our analysis estimates that receiving a booster dose reduces the odds of having a PCR-detected SARS-CoV-2 infection relative to full vaccination by 52% (95% confidence interval [37%, 64%]). This result is robust to the choice of the delay over which a booster dose becomes effective (varied from 1 day to 14 days). Conclusions: Boosters are effective, relative to full vaccination, in reducing the odds of SARS-CoV-2 infections in a college student population during a period when Omicron was predominant. Therefore, booster vaccinations for this age group can play an important role in reducing community and institutional transmission.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""}",10.1101/2022.03.08.22272056,coronavirus disease 2019;human;nonhuman;revaccination;adult;controlled study;drug therapy;elasomeran;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;tozinameran;vaccination;sensitivity analysis;female;gender;major clinical study;male;cohort analysis;ad26.cov2.s vaccine;groups by age;young adult;college student;university student,,,15102

Data support the effectiveness of boosters in preventing severe disease and hospitalization; however, the real-world impact on reducing incident SARS-CoV-2 infections across specific variants is not yet clear. Objectives: Assess the impact of COVID-19 boosters on protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a real-world setting from a highly vaccinated (99%) population curated from a linked database with test results, vaccination history, patient demographics, and genomic sequencing information from the National Basketball Association (NBA). Methods: In this population, 1,613 fully vaccinated staff and players (median age 34.5 years, 88% male) who tested at least once between 1 December 2021 and 5 January 2022, were analyzed. Individuals were tested at the time of reporting any symptom, regardless of severity, after known exposure per self-report or contact tracing and/or during enhanced surveillance. Boosted individuals (n=1260) were compared to fully vaccinated and booster eligible individuals (n=162), defined as 2 months post-JNJ-78436735 or 5-months post-second dose of mRNA vaccine. Individuals not yet eligible for a booster and those who recovered from COVID-19 between 1 November and 30 November, 2021 (n=25) were examined in secondary analyses but excluded from the primary comparison. Individuals who were not fully vaccinated (n=27) or who received a booster within 14 days during or prior to the observation period (n=916) were excluded. Results: In this closely monitored population, fully vaccinated booster-eligible individuals were 2.6 times more likely (RR = 2.6, 95% CI: 2.2 to 3.0, p<0.0001) to have a confirmed COVID-19 infection than boosted individuals. Secondary analysis including non-boosted individuals with recent vaccination or recent SARSCoV-2 infection found that non-boosted individuals were at greater risk of infection compared with boosted individuals (RR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.8 to 2.4, p<0.001). Results were similar when stratified by primary vaccination type with overlapping confidence intervals. No hospitalizations or deaths were observed in this cohort. Genetic sequencing confirmed 93% of infections to be Omicron (among n=330 sequenced). Conclusions: These results highlight the protective benefit of boosters against incident SARS-CoV-19 infection, not only for severe symptoms and death. Assessment of booster effectiveness remains vital for COVID-19 vaccines as new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge, as there is still uncertainty around performance in real-world settings.

However, we lack effectiveness data on boosters preventing infection, death and hospitalization in this frail population. Methods We emulated nested target trials in two large nursing home systems in parallel to evaluate the effectiveness of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine booster at preventing infection, hospitalization, or death. Residents who completed a 2-dose series of the mRNA vaccine and were eligible for a booster were included in from September 22, 2021 to November 5, 2021. Outcomes were measured through December 18, 2021, including test-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, or death.

The third wave of COVID-19 in England began in May 2021 as the Delta variant began to outcompete and largely replace other strains. The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) series of community surveys for SARS-CoV-2 infection has provided insights into transmission dynamics since May 2020. Round 15 of the REACT-1 study was carried out from 19 October to 5 November 2021. Methods: We estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infection and used multiple logistic regression to analyse associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection in England and demographic and other risk factors, based on RT-PCR results from self-administered throat and nose swabs in over 100,000 participants. We estimated (single-dose) vaccine effectiveness among children aged 12 to 17 years, and among adults compared swab-positivity in people who had received a third (booster) dose with those who had received two vaccine doses. We used splines to analyse time trends in swab-positivity. Results: During mid-October to early-November 2021, weighted prevalence was 1.57% (1.48%, 1.66%) compared to 0.83% (0.76%, 0.89%) in September 2021 (round 14). Weighted prevalence increased between rounds 14 and 15 across most age groups (including older ages, 65 years and over) and regions, with average reproduction number across rounds of R=1.09 (1.08, 1.11). During round 15, there was a fall in prevalence from a maximum around 20-21 October, with an R of 0.76 (0.70, 0.83), reflecting falls in prevalence at ages 17 years and below and 18 to 54 years. School-aged children had the highest weighted prevalence of infection: 4.95% (4.39%, 5.58%) in those aged 5 to 12 years and 5.21% (4.61%, 5.87%) in those aged 13 to 17 years. In multiple logistic regression, age, sex, key worker status and presence of one or more children in the home were associated with swab positivity. There was evidence of heterogeneity between rounds in swab positivity rates among vaccinated individuals at ages 18 to 64 years, and differences in key demographic and other variables between vaccinated and unvaccinated adults at these ages. Vaccine effectiveness against infection in children was estimated to be 56.2% (41.3%, 67.4%) in rounds 13, 14 and 15 combined, adjusted for demographic factors, with a similar estimate obtained for round 15 only. Among adults we found that those who received a third dose of vaccine were less likely to test positive compared to those who received only two vaccine doses, with adjusted odds ratio (OR) =0.38 (0.26, 0.55). Discussion: Swab-positivity was very high at the start of round 15, reaching a maximum around 20 to 21 October 2021, and then falling through late October with an uncertain trend in the last few days of data collection. The observational nature of survey data and the relatively small proportion of unvaccinated adults call into question the comparability of vaccinated and unvaccinated groups at this relatively late stage in the vaccination programme. However, third vaccine doses for eligible adults and the vaccination of children aged 12 years and over are associated with lower infection risk and, thus, remain a high priority (with possible extension to children aged 5-12 years). These should help reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the winter period when healthcare demands typically rise.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""}",10.1101/2021.12.14.21267806,vaccine;human;nonhuman;adult;controlled study;drug therapy;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;female;major clinical study;male;demography;England;groups by age;risk assessment;polymerase chain reaction;risk factor;infection risk;adolescent;child;community transmission;health care need;nose smear;positivity rate;prevalence;reproduction;school child;throat;winter;worker;Vaccination;Only Child;Child;Vaccines,,,100112

METHODS: Immunocompetent adults who received a booster dose of mRNA-1273 from October through December 2021 were matched 1:1 to randomly selected 2-dose mRNA-1273 recipients by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and second dose date, and followed up through January 2022. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), comparing outcomes (SARS-CoV-2 infection, and COVID-19 hospitalization and hospital death) in the booster-dose and 2-dose groups. Adjusted rVE (%) was calculated as (1-aHR)x100. aHRs and rVEs were also estimated for SARS-CoV-2 infection by subgroups (age, sex, race/ethnicity, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, pregnancy, chronic diseases), and for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 disease by month of follow-up.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cohort study used 100% Medicare claims from January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2021, and matched 3,940,475 individuals who received boosters to 3,940,475 controls based on week and type of original COVID-19 vaccine and demographic and clinical characteristics. We compared the association of booster vs no booster with COVID-19 hospitalization using Cox proportional hazards regression models controlling for patient characteristics. We also determined the association of time from original vaccine to booster with COVID-19 hospitalization. RESULTS: Over a maximum of 130 days of follow-up, boosted enrollees had 8.20 (95% CI, 7.81 to 8.60) COVID-19 hospitalizations per million days vs 43.70 (95% CI, 42.79 to 44.64) for controls (81% effectiveness).

The adjusted RR of the primary vaccine series compared with being unvaccinated against infection became 0.53 (95% CI, 0.52-0.53) for BNT162b2, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.51-0.53) for mRNA-1273, and 0.51 (95% CI, 0.50-0.53) for Ad26.COV2.S 10 months after the first dose, but the adjusted HR for hospitalization remained at 0.29 (95% CI, 0.24-0.35) for BNT162b2, 0.27 (95% CI, 0.23-0.32) for mRNA-1273, and 0.35 (95% CI, 0.29-0.42) for Ad26.COV2.S and the adjusted HR of death remained at 0.23 (95% CI, 0.17-0.29) for BNT162b2, 0.15 (95% CI, 0.11-0.20) for mRNA-1273, and 0.24 (95% CI, 0.19-0.31) for Ad26.COV2.S. For the BNT162b2 primary series, boosting in December 2021 with BNT162b2 had the adjusted RR relative to primary series of 0.39 (95% CI, 0.38-0.40) and boosting with mRNA-1273 had the adjusted RR of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.30-0.34) against infection after 1 month and boosting with BNT162b2 had the adjusted RR of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.82-0.86) and boosting with mRNA-1273 had the adjusted RR of 0.60 (95% CI, 0.57-0.62) after 3 months. Among all participants, the adjusted RR of Omicron infection compared with no prior infection was estimated at 0.23 (95% CI, 0.22-0.24) against infection, and the adjusted HRs were 0.10 (95% CI, 0.07-0.14) against hospitalization and 0.11 (95% CI, 0.08-0.15) against death after 4 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Receipt of primary COVID-19 vaccine series compared with being unvaccinated, receipt of boosters compared with primary vaccination, and prior infection compared with no prior infection were all significantly associated with lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (including Omicron) and resulting hospitalization and death. The associated protection waned over time, especially against infection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""}",10.1001/jama.2022.17876,Ad26COVS1;Adult;BNT162 Vaccine;*COVID-19/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines;Cohort Studies;Female;Humans;Male;SARS-CoV-2;Vaccination;*Viral Vaccines/administration & dosage,36155617,PMC9513711,10600823

The primary aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine based on number of administered doses in patients with IBD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using TriNetX, a multi-institutional database to compare patients with IBD who received 1, 2, or 3 doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 to unvaccinated IBD patients (1.1.2020-7.26.2022) to assess the risk of COVID-19 after 1:1 propensity score matching. We also evaluated the impact of vaccine on a composite of severe COVID-19 outcomes including hospitalization, intubation, intensive care unit care, acute kidney injury, or mortality. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, vaccinated patients with 2 (adjusted OR [aOR], 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6-0.9) and 3 doses (aOR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9) were found to have a lower risk of COVID-19 compared with unvaccinated patients. Vaccinated patients with IBD had a lower risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes (aOR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-0.9) compared with unvaccinated patients. There was no difference in the risk of COVID-19 in IBD patients with 2 compared with 3 doses (aOR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.7-1.3). However, IBD patients with 2 doses were at an increased risk for hospitalization due to COVID-19 (aOR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.02-3.11) compared with those that received 3 doses. CONCLUSION: Vaccinated patients with IBD had a lower risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes compared with unvaccinated patients. A third dose of COVID-19 vaccine compared with 2 doses decreases the risk of hospitalization but not breakthrough infection in patients with IBD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""}",10.1093/ibd/izac252,Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Vaccination;Vaccines,36576102,,10576

METHODS: We followed 85 801 participants (aged 31-81 years) in 2 large population-based cohorts during the Omicron BA.1/2 wave. Information on home testing, PCR testing, and symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was extracted from biweekly questionnaires covering the period 12 January 2022 to 7 April 2022. Vaccination status and data on previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from national registries. Cox regression was used to estimate the effectiveness of booster vaccination compared to receipt of 2-dose primary series >130 days previously. RESULTS: The effectiveness of booster vaccination increased with increasing severity of COVID-19 and decreased with time since booster vaccination. The effectiveness against severe COVID-19 was reduced from 80.9% shortly after booster vaccination to 63.4% in the period >90 days after vaccination. There was hardly any effect against mild COVID-19. The effectiveness tended to be lower among subjects aged ≥60 years than those aged <50 years.

The objective of this study was to estimate the effectiveness of primary (two-dose series) and booster (third dose) mRNA vaccination against Omicron (lineage BA.1) infection among people with a prior documented infection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a test-negative case-control study of reverse transcription PCRs (RT-PCRs) analyzed with the TaqPath (Thermo Fisher Scientific) assay and recorded in the Yale New Haven Health system from November 1, 2021, to April 30, 2022. Overall, 11,307 cases (positive TaqPath analyzed RT-PCRs with S-gene target failure [SGTF]) and 130,041 controls (negative TaqPath analyzed RT-PCRs) were included (median age: cases: 35 years, controls: 39 years). Among cases and controls, 5.9% and 8.1% had a documented prior infection (positive SARS-CoV-2 test record ≥90 days prior to the included test), respectively. We estimated the effectiveness of primary and booster vaccination relative to SGTF-defined Omicron (lineage BA.1) variant infection using a logistic regression adjusted for date of test, age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance, comorbidities, social venerability index, municipality, and healthcare utilization. The effectiveness of primary vaccination 14 to 149 days after the second dose was 41.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 14.1% to 59.4%, p 0.006) and 27.1% (95% CI: 18.7% to 34.6%, p < 0.001) for people with and without a documented prior infection, respectively. The effectiveness of booster vaccination (≥14 days after booster dose) was 47.1% (95% CI: 22.4% to 63.9%, p 0.001) and 54.1% (95% CI: 49.2% to 58.4%, p < 0.001) in people with and without a documented prior infection, respectively. To test whether booster vaccination reduced the risk of infection beyond that of the primary series, we compared the odds of infection among boosted (≥14 days after booster dose) and booster-eligible people (≥150 days after second dose). The odds ratio (OR) comparing boosted and booster-eligible people with a documented prior infection was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.54 to 1.16, p 0.222), whereas the OR comparing boosted and booster-eligible people without a documented prior infection was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.49 to 0.59, p < 0.001). This study's limitations include the risk of residual confounding, the use of data from a single system, and the reliance on TaqPath analyzed RT-PCR results. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that primary vaccination provided significant but limited protection against Omicron (lineage BA.1) infection among people with and without a documented prior infection. While booster vaccination was associated with additional protection against Omicron BA.1 infection in people without a documented prior infection, it was not found to be associated with additional protection among people with a documented prior infection. These findings support primary vaccination in people regardless of documented prior infection status but suggest that infection history may impact the relative benefit of booster doses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""}",10.1371/journal.pmed.1004136,"Humans;Adult;*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;SARS-CoV-2/genetics;Case-Control Studies;Odds Ratio;Vaccination;RNA, Messenger",36454733,PMC9714718,141378

METHODS: In a retrospective study from December 15, 2020 to January 15, 2022, SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCWs at a large tertiary cancer centre in New York City were examined to estimate infection rates (aggregated positive tests / person-days) and 95% CIs over the Omicron period in 3D and 2D mRNA vaccinated HCWs and were compared using rate ratios. We described the clinical features of post-vaccine infections and impact of prior (pre-Omicron) COVID infection on vaccine effectiveness. RESULTS: Among the 20857 HCWs in our cohort, 20,660 completed the 2D series with an mRNA vaccine during our study period and 12461 had received a third dose by January 15, 2022.

However, there is little evidence regarding other primary vaccine schedules such as BBIBP-CorV and ChAdOx1-S. We estimated the relative vaccine effectiveness (RVE) of the booster dose versus the primary regimens of COVID-19 vaccines based on BBIBP-CorV, ChAdOx1-S, or BNT162b2 for preventing death during the Omicron wave in Peruvian adult people. METHODS: We carried out a nested case-control study with a risk set sampling of controls using data from Peru between December 20, 2021, and February 20, 2022 (during the Omicron wave). Data on vaccination, COVID-19 tests and deaths were collected from national surveillance databases. We performed conditional logistic regression models to estimate the RVE on the adult population. In addition, we executed sub-group analysis per age group (18 to 59 years, and 60 years or more) and per primary regime (based on BNT162b2, BBIBP-CorV, or ChAdOx1-S). RESULTS: Of the 11,188,332 people eligible to enter the study 1,974 met the case definition (death from COVID-19) and were matched to 9,183 controls. The overall RVE of a third dose to prevent death was 87.2% (84.2%-89.7%), which varied according to the primary regime (87.3% for BNT162b2, 82.0% for BBIPB-CorV-2, and 79.5% for ChAdOx-S). In older adults, the RVE was 87.1%, without significant variations according to the primary regime (86.1% for BNT162b2, 86.1 for BBIBP-CorV, and 82% for ChAdOx-S). CONCLUSIONS: The booster) dose of vaccine against COVID-19 had a high RVE for preventing death by COVID-19 in the Peruvian population in all primary regimes of vaccines during the Omicron wave.

Based on the analysis of 831,555 matched pairs, we found that a 2nd booster dose of mRNA vaccine, 14-118 days post administration, was moderately effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to a 1st booster dose administered at least 120 days earlier [14.3 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 2.2-20.2]. RVE decreased from 28.5 % (95 % CI: 24.7-32.1) in the time-interval 14-28 days to 7.6 % (95 % CI: -14.1 to 18.3) in the time-interval 56-118 days. However, RVE against severe COVID-19 was higher (34.0 %, 95 % CI: 23.4-42.7), decreasing from 43.2 % (95 % CI: 30.6-54.9) to 27.2 % (95 % CI: 8.3-42.9) over the same time span. Although RVE against SARS-CoV-2 infection was much reduced 2-4 months after a 2nd booster dose, RVE against severe COVID-19 was about 30 %, even during prevalent circulation of the Omicron BA.5 subvariant. The cost-benefit of a 3rd booster dose for the elderly people who received the 2nd booster dose at least four months earlier should be carefully evaluated.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.11.013,"Aged;Humans;*COVID-19 Vaccines;Cohort Studies;Retrospective Studies;*COVID-19/prevention & control;SARS-CoV-2;Italy/epidemiology;Vaccination;Italy;RNA, Messenger",36400660,PMC9659513,1663110

Design: Population-based cohort analyses. Setting: Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, 27 December 2020 to 28 February 2022. Participants: Adults that had received at least a primary vaccination schedule (ie, two doses) of the AZD, BNT, and/or MOD vaccines during the study period. Main outcome measures: Using the Kaplan-Meier estimator, we compared country-specific risks of SARSCoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes in heterologous booster vaccinated with primary schedule vaccinated (matched analyses) and homologous booster vaccinated (weighted analyses) since emergence of omicron. Results: Heterologous booster schedules improved protection against all outcomes compared with primary schedules, with the largest and most robust effects observed for severe COVID-19. Risk differences for documented infection ranged from -22.4% to -3.1% (comparative vaccine effectiveness [CVE] 9.7% to 60.9%; >63.2% for COVID-19 hospitalisation) across countries for AZD1BNT2BNT3 (AZD as primary dose followed by two doses of BNT) vs AZD1BNT2 and -22.2% to -3.2% (CVE 37.4% to 67.8%; >34.6% for hospitalisation) for BNT1BNT2MOD3 vs BNT1BNT2, the two most common heterologous booster schedules. Heterologous- and homologous booster schedules had comparable effectiveness. Risk differences of documented infection ranged from -0.4% to 4.4% (CVE -20.0% to 2.4%) for AZD1BNT2BNT3 vs BNT1BNT2BNT3 and -19.8% to 1.7% (CVE -14.6% to 53.8%) for BNT1BNT2MOD3 vs BNT1BNT2BNT3; for most comparisons, risk differences for severe COVID-19 outcomes were smaller than 1 per 1000 vaccinated. Previous infection followed by a booster dose conferred the greatest protection. Conclusion: Heterologous booster vaccine schedules are associated with an increased protection against omicron-related COVID-19 outcomes that is comparable to that afforded by homologous booster schedules.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""}",10.1101/2022.11.24.22282651     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.11.24.22282651&atitle=Comparative+effectiveness+of+heterologous+booster+schedules+with+AZD1222%2C+BNT162b2%2C+or+mRNA-1273+vaccines+against+COVID-19+during+omicron+predominance+in+the+Nordic+countries&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Andersson&aufirst=Niklas+Worm&auinit=N.W.&aufull=Andersson+N.W.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=N&auinitm=W,"adult;attributable risk;cohort analysis;comparative effectiveness;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;Denmark;drug therapy;female;Finland;hospitalization;human;Kaplan Meier method;male;Norway;outcome assessment;Sweden;vaccination;elasomeran;tozinameran;vaxzevria;RNA, Messenger;Vaccination;Vaccines",,,3260410

Abu-Raddad, Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Cornell University, Doha, Qatar""]","Background: Long-term effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA boosters in populations with different prior infection histories and clinical vulnerability profiles is inadequately understood. Methods: A national, matched, retrospective, target trial cohort study was conducted in Qatar to investigate effectiveness of a third mRNA (booster) dose, relative to a primary series of two doses, against SARS-CoV-2 omicron infection and against severe COVID-19. Associations were estimated using Cox proportional-hazards regression models. Results: Booster effectiveness relative to primary series was 41.1% (95% CI: 40.0-42.1%) against infection and 80.5% (95% CI: 55.7-91.4%) against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19, over one-year follow-up after the booster. Among persons clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19, effectiveness was 49.7% (95% CI: 47.8-51.6%) against infection and 84.2% (95% CI: 58.8-93.9%) against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19. Effectiveness against infection was highest at 57.1% (95% CI: 55.9-58.3%) in the first month after the booster but waned thereafter and was modest at only 14.4% (95% CI: 7.3-20.9%) by the sixth month. In the seventh month and thereafter, coincident with BA.4/BA.5 and BA.2.75* subvariant incidence, effectiveness was progressively negative reaching -20.3% (95% CI: -55.0-29.0%) after one year of follow-up. Similar levels and patterns of protection were observed irrespective of prior infection status, clinical vulnerability, or type of vaccine (BNT162b2 versus mRNA-1273). Conclusions: Boosters reduced infection and severe COVID-19, particularly among those clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19. However, protection against infection waned after the booster, and eventually suggested an imprinting effect of compromised protection relative to the primary series. However, imprinting effects are unlikely to negate the overall public health value of booster vaccinations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""}",10.1101/2022.11.14.22282103     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.11.14.22282103&atitle=Long-term+COVID-19+booster+effectiveness+by+infection+history+and+clinical+vulnerability+and+immune+imprinting&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Chemaitelly&aufirst=Hiam&auinit=H.&aufull=Chemaitelly+H.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=H&auinitm=,adult;clinical trial;cohort analysis;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;female;follow up;human;incidence;male;nonhuman;original antigenic sin;public health;Qatar;retrospective study;revaccination;SARS-CoV-2 Omicron;vulnerability;elasomeran;messenger RNA;tozinameran,,,304091

Kwong, ICES, G1 06, 2075 Bayview Avenue, Toronto, ON, Canada","Background: As of December 30, 2021, Ontario long-term care (LTC) residents who received a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine ≥84 days previously were offered a fourth dose to prevent a surge in COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality due to the Omicron variant. Seven months have passed since fourth doses were implemented, allowing for the examination of fourth dose protection over time. Methods: We used a test-negative design and linked databases to estimate the marginal effectiveness (4 versus 3 doses) and vaccine effectiveness (VE; 2, 3, or 4 doses versus no doses) of mRNA vaccines among Ontario LTC residents aged ≥60 years who were tested for SARSCoV-2 between December 30, 2021 and August 3, 2022. Outcome measures included any Omicron infection, symptomatic infection, and severe outcomes (hospitalization or death). Results: We included 21,275 Omicron cases and 273,466 test-negative controls. The marginal effectiveness of a fourth dose <84 days ago compared to a third dose received ≥84 days ago was 23% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 17-29%), 36% (95%CI 26-44%), and 37% (95%CI 24-48%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic infection, and severe outcomes, respectively. Additional protection provided by a fourth dose compared to a third dose was negligible against all outcomes ≥168 days after vaccination. Compared to unvaccinated individuals, vaccine effectiveness (VE) of a fourth dose decreased from 49% (95%CI 44%-54%) to 18% (95%CI 5-28%) against infection, 69% (95%CI 62-75%) to 44% (95%CI 24-59%) against symptomatic infection, and 82% (95%CI 77-86%) to 74% (95%CI 62-82%) against severe outcomes <84 days versus ≥168 days after vaccination. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that fourth doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines provide additional protection against Omicron-related outcomes in LTC residents, but the protection wanes over time, with more waning seen against infection than severe outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""}",10.1101/2022.09.29.22280526     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.09.29.22280526&atitle=Effectiveness+and+Duration+of+Protection+of+a+Fourth+Dose+of+COVID-19+mRNA+Vaccine+among+Long-Term+Care+Residents+in+Ontario%2C+Canada&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Grewal&aufirst=Ramandip&auinit=R.&aufull=Grewal+R.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=R&auinitm=,"adult;Canada;comparative effectiveness;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;hospitalization;human;long term care;Ontario;outcome assessment;resident;vaccination;RNA vaccine;SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;RNA, Messenger;Vaccination;Long-Term Care;Vaccines",,,294741

Design: Retrospective, test-negative, case-control study, with matched analysis. Setting: Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, between 12/1/21-4/1/21. Participants: 422,144 individuals ≥50 years who had received two or three doses of COVID-19 vaccines and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Main outcome measures: Odds ratios of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisations and death after administering different boosters, compared to a two-dose primary scheme. Results: Of 221,933(52.5%) individuals with a positive test, 190,884(45.2%) had received a two-dose vaccination scheme and 231,260(54.8%) a three-dose scheme. The matched analysis included 127,014 cases and 180,714 controls. The three-dose scheme reduced infections (OR 0.81[0.80-0.83]) but after 60 days protection dropped (OR 1.04[1.01-1.06]). The booster dose decreased the risk of hospitalisations and deaths after 15-59 days (ORs 0.28[0.25-0.32] and 0.25[0.22-0.28] respectively), which persisted after administration for 75[66-89] days. Administration of a homologous booster after a primary scheme with vectored-vaccines provided low protection against infections (OR 0.94[0.92-0.97] and 1.05[1.01-1.09] before and after 60 days). Protection against hospitalisations and death was significant (OR 0.30[0.26-0.35] and 0.29[0.25-0.33] respectively) but decreased after 60 days (OR 0.59[0.47-0.74] and 0.51[0.41- 0.64] respectively). The inoculation of a heterologous booster after a primary course with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, rAd26-rAd5, BBIBP-CorV, or heterologous schemes, offered some protection against infection (OR 0.70[0.68-0.71]), which decreased after 60 days (OR 1.01[0.98-1.04]). The protective effect against hospitalisations and deaths (OR 0.26[0.22-0.31] and 0.22[0.18-0.25] respectively) was clear and persisted after 60 days (OR 0.43[0.35-0.53] and 0.33[0.26-0.41]).

Primary vaccination provides strong short-term protection, but data are limited on duration of protection following booster vaccines, particularly against the Omicron variant. We investigated effectiveness of booster vaccination against infections, hospitalisations and deaths among LTCF residents and staff in England. Methods We included residents and staff of LTCFs within the VIVALDI study (ISRCTN 14447421) who underwent routine, asymptomatic testing (December 12 2021-March 31 2022). Cox regression was used to estimate relative hazards of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and associated hospitalisation and death at 0-13, 14-48, 49-83 and 84 days after dose 3 of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination compared to 2 doses (after 84+ days), stratified by previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and adjusting for age, sex, LTCF capacity and local SARS-CoV-2 incidence. Results 14175 residents and 19973 staff were included. In residents without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, infection risk was reduced 0-83 days after first booster, but no protection was apparent after 84 days. Additional protection following booster vaccination waned, but was still present at 84+ days for COVID-associated hospitalisation (aHR: 0.47, 0.24-0.89) and death (aHR: 0.37, 0.21-0.62). Most residents (64.4%) had received primary course of AstraZeneca, but this did not impact on pre- or post-booster risks. Staff showed a similar pattern of waning booster effectiveness against infection, with few hospitalisations and no deaths. Conclusions Booster vaccination provides sustained protection against severe outcomes following infection with the Omicron variant, but no protection against infection from 3 months onwards. Ongoing surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in LTCFs is crucial.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""}",10.1101/2022.08.08.22278532     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.08.08.22278532&atitle=Clinical+effectiveness+of+SARS-CoV-2+booster+vaccine+against+Omicron+infection+in+residents+and+staff+of+Long-Term+Care+Facilities%3A+a+prospective+cohort+study+%28VIVALDI%29&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Stirrup&aufirst=Oliver&auinit=O.&aufull=Stirrup+O.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=O&auinitm=,adult;cohort analysis;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;England;female;hospitalization;human;incidence;infection risk;male;nonhuman;nursing home;prospective study;resident;revaccination;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;vaccine;Cohort Studies;Vaccination;Long-Term Care;Vaccines,,,34148
