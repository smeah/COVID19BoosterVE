N2  - BACKGROUND: Waning of COVID-19 vaccine protection and emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant have expedited efforts to scale up booster vaccination. This study compared protection afforded by booster doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines, compared to the primary series of only two doses in Qatar, during a large, rapidly growing Omicron wave. METHODS: In a population of 2,232,224 vaccinated persons with at least two doses, two matched, retrospective cohort studies were implemented to investigate effectiveness of booster vaccination against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and against COVID-19 hospitalization and death, up to January 9, 2022. Association of booster status with infection was estimated using Cox proportional-hazards regression models. RESULTS: For BNT162b2, cumulative symptomatic infection incidence was 2.9% (95% CI: 2.8-3.1%) in the booster-dose cohort and 5.5% (95% CI: 5.3-5.7%) in the primary-series cohort, after 49 days of follow-up. Adjusted hazard ratio for symptomatic infection was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.47-0.53). Booster effectiveness relative to primary series was 50.1% (95% CI: 47.3-52.8%). For mRNA-1273, cumulative symptomatic infection incidence was 1.9% (95% CI: 1.7-2.2%) in the booster-dose cohort and 3.5% (95% CI: 3.2-3.9%) in the primary-series cohort, after 35 days of follow-up. The adjusted hazard ratio for symptomatic infection was 0.49 (95% CI: 0.43-0.57). Booster effectiveness relative to primary series was 50.8% (95% CI: 43.4-57.3%). There were fewer cases of severe COVID-19 in booster-dose cohorts than in primary-series cohorts, but cases of severe COVID-19 were rare in all cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: mRNA booster vaccination is associated with modest effectiveness against symptomatic infection with Omicron. The development of a new generation of vaccines targeting a broad range of variants may be warranted.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In early 2021, Qatar launched a mass immunization campaign with Moderna's mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine. We assessed persistence of real-world mRNA-1273 effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection and against COVID-19 hospitalization and death. METHODS: Effectiveness was estimated using test-negative, case-control study design, between January 1 and December 5, 2021. Effectiveness was estimated against documented infection (a PCR-positive swab, regardless symptoms), and against any severe (acute-care hospitalization), critical (ICU hospitalization), or fatal COVID-19. RESULTS: By December 5, 2021, 2,962 breakthrough infections had been recorded among those who received two mRNA-1273 doses. Of these infections, 19 progressed to severe COVID-19 and 4 to critical, but none to fatal disease. mRNA-1273 effectiveness against infection was negligible for the first two weeks after the first dose, increased to 65.5% (95% CI: 62.7-68.0%) 14 or more days after the first dose, and reached its peak at about 90% in the first three months after the second dose. Effectiveness declined gradually starting from the fourth month after the second dose and was below 50% by the 7th month after the second dose. Effectiveness against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 reached its peak at essentially 100% right after the second dose, and there was no evidence for declining effectiveness over time. Effectiveness against symptomatic versus asymptomatic infection demonstrated the same pattern of waning, but effectiveness against symptomatic infection was consistently higher than that against asymptomatic infection and waned more slowly. CONCLUSIONS: mRNA-1273-induced protection against infection appears to wane month by month after the second dose. Meanwhile, protection against hospitalization and death appears robust with no evidence for waning for several months after the second dose.

N2  - Objectives: To compare the effectiveness of a primary COVID-19 vaccine series plus a booster dose with a primary series alone for the prevention of Omicron variant COVID-19 hospitalization. Design: Multicenter observational case-control study using the test-negative design to evaluate vaccine effectiveness (VE). Setting: Twenty-one hospitals in the United States (US). Participants: 3,181 adults hospitalized with an acute respiratory illness between December 26, 2021 and April 30, 2022, a period of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (BA.1, BA.2) predominance. Participants included 1,572 (49%) case-patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 and 1,609 (51%) control patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Median age was 64 years, 48% were female, and 21% were immunocompromised; 798 (25%) were vaccinated with a primary series plus booster, 1,326 (42%) were vaccinated with a primary series alone, and 1,057 (33%) were unvaccinated. Main Outcome Measures: VE against COVID-19 hospitalization was calculated for a primary series plus a booster and a primary series alone by comparing the odds of being vaccinated with each of these regimens versus being unvaccinated among cases versus controls. VE analyses were stratified by immune status (immunocompetent; immunocompromised) because the recommended vaccine schedules are different for these groups. The primary analysis evaluated all COVID-19 vaccine types combined and secondary analyses evaluated specific vaccine products. Results: Among immunocompetent patients, VE against Omicron COVID-19 hospitalization for a primary series plus one booster of any vaccine product dose was 77% (95% CI: 71–82%), and for a primary series alone was 44% (95% CI: 31–54%) (p<0.001). VE was higher for a boosted regimen than a primary series alone for both mRNA vaccines used in the US (BNT162b2: primary series plus booster VE 80% (95% CI: 73-85%), primary series alone VE 46% (95% CI: 30-58%) [p<0.001]; mRNA-1273: primary series plus booster VE 77% (95% CI: 67-83%), primary series alone VE 47% (95% CI: 30-60%) [p<0.001]). Among immunocompromised patients, VE for a primary series of any vaccine product against Omicron COVID-19 hospitalization was 60% (95% CI: 41-73%). Insufficient sample size has accumulated to calculate effectiveness of boosted regimens for immunocompromised patients. Conclusions: Among immunocompetent people, a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine provided additional benefit beyond a primary vaccine series alone for preventing COVID-19 hospitalization due to the Omicron variant.

N2  - Introduction. In COVID-19 patients, increased IL-6 levels have been associated with poor disease prognosis. The use of tocilizumab shown to be effective in treating COVID-19 with varying success. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of using a single dose of tocilizumab compared with multiple doses in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methods. This study is a two-center, retrospective cohort, in which patients who received tocilizumab and were admitted to the ICU at two tertiary hospitals from March 1st, 2020, until January 31st, 2021were included. Patients were divided into two groups based on the number of doses of tocilizumab they received. Furthermore, we gathered additional data from the patients, such as but not limited to demographic data, vital signs, and laboratory markers. Multivariable logistic and generalized linear regression were used. We considered a P value of < 0.05 statistically significant. Results. Two hundred sixty-one patients were included in this study; 72.4% received a single dose of tocilizumab, while the rest (27.6%) had received multiple doses. Most of the patients were male, with an average age of 59.2. After adjusting for possible confounders, the ICU mortality within 30 days (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.33-2.08 p = 0.69) and inhospital mortality (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.26-1.60 p = 0.35) were not significantly different between the two groups. On the flip side, patients who received multiple doses of tocilizumab have higher odds of secondary infection compared with a single dose (OR 3.06; 95% CI 1.18-7.89 p = 0.02). Conclusion. Multiple doses of tocilizumab were not associated with a statistically significant difference in ICU and hospital mortality in critically ill patients infected with COVID-19. In contrast, it was associated with higher odds of secondary infections compared to a single dose. e-Posters: Sepsis.

N2  - Introduction: The risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19 was found to be significantly higher in patients who experienced thromboembolic events. Thus, several guidelines recommend using prophylactic anticoagulants in all COVID-19 hospitalized patients. However, there is uncertainty about the appropriate dosing regimen and safety of anticoagulation in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Thus, this study aims to compare the effectiveness and safety of standard versus escalated dose pharmacological venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Methods: A two-center retrospective cohort study including critically ill patients aged ≥ 18-years with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at two tertiary hospitals in Saudi Arabia from March 1st, 2020, until January 31st, 2021. Patients who received either Enoxaparin 40 mg daily or Unfractionated heparin 5000 Units three times daily were grouped under the “standard dose VTE prophylaxis and patients who received higher than the standard dose but not as treatment dose were grouped under ”escalated VTE prophylaxis dose“. The primary outcome was the occurance of thrombotic events, and the secondary outcomes were bleeding, mortality, and other ICU-related complications. Results: A total of 758 patients were screened; 565 patients were included in the study. We matched 352 patients using propensity score matching (1:1). In patients who received escalated dose pharmacological VTE prophylaxis, any case of thrombosis and VTE were similar between the two groups (OR 1.22;95 %CI 0.52–2.86; P = 0.64 and OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.16–3.38; P = 0.70 respectively). However, the odds of minor bleeding was higher in patients who received escalated VTE prophylaxis dose (OR 3.39; 95% CI 1.08–10.61; P = 0.04). There was no difference in the 30-day mortality nor in-hospital mortality between the two groups (HR 1.17;95 %CI0.79–1.73; P = 0.43 and HR 1.08;95 %CI 0.76–1.53; P = 0.83, respectively). Conclusion: Escalated-dose pharmacological VTE prophylaxis in critically ill patients with COVID-19 was not associated with thrombosis, or mortality benefits but led to an increased risk of minor bleeding. This study supports previous evidence regarding the optimal dosing VTE pharmacological prophylaxis regimen for critically ill patients with COVID-19.

N2  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading infection that is on the rise. New variants are continuously appearing with variable degrees of lethality and infectivity. The extensive work since the start of the pandemic has led to the evolution of COVID-19 vaccines with varying mechanisms. We aim to determine real-world data by looking at the different clinical outcomes associated with COVID-19 vaccination, focusing on the rate of hospitalization, severity, and mortality. Methodology: A retrospective observational study included 624 patients with COVID-19 infection who were hospitalized at King Fahad Hospital of the University and King Fahad Military Medical City between April and July 2021. The cohort was divided into 3 groups: unvaccinated, partially vaccinated (PV), and fully vaccinated (FV). The severity and outcome of COVID-19 disease were compared among the three groups. Among the vaccinated group, we studied the effect of vaccine type on the severity and outcome of COVID-19 disease. Results: We found that 70.4% of patients with COVID-19 disease who required hospitalization were unvaccinated. Un-vaccination was a significant predictor of critical COVID-19 disease (OR 2.31; P <0.001), whereas full vaccination was associated with significantly milder disease severity (OR 0.36; P 0.01). Moreover, un-vaccination status was an independent predictor of longer hospitalization (OR 3.0; P <0.001), a higher requirement for ICU admission (OR 4.7; P <0.001), mechanical ventilation (OR 3.6; P <0.001), and death (OR 4.8; P <0.001), whereas the FV group had a lower risk of ICU admission (OR 0.49; P 0.045). Unvaccinated patients with comorbidities had worse severity and outcome of COVID-19 infection (P<0.05). Both vaccine types (Pfizer and AstraZeneca) had similar protective effects against the worst outcomes of COVID-19 disease. Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccination has been shown to be effective in reducing hospitalization, the severity of COVID-19 infection, and improving outcomes, especially in high-risk group patients. COVID-19 vaccination programs should continue to improve the outcome of such a disease.

N2  - Background: Saudi Arabia expedited the approval of some COVID-19 vaccines and launched mass vaccination campaigns. The aim of this study was to describe the demographics of vaccinated COVID-19 cases and compare the mortality rates of COVID-19 cases who were infected post-vaccination in Saudi Arabia. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. We retrieved data for COVID-19 cases who were infected pre-or post-vaccination and had received at least one injection of the Oxford–AstraZeneca or Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine from 4 December 2020 to 15 October 2021. Results: The number of patients who were infected and had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine was 281,744. Approximately 45% of subjects were infected post-vaccination, and 75% of subjects had received the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine. Only 0.342% of the patients who were infected post-vaccination died, and 447 patients were admitted to ICUs. Most of the patients who were infected with COVID-19 post-vaccination and were admitted to ICUs (69.84%) had received only one dose of the vaccine (p < 0.0001). The mean time to infection for patients who had received one and two doses of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine were 27 and 8 days longer than their counterparts who had received one and two doses of Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine, respectively. No difference in the odds of mortality between the Pfizer–BioNTech and Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccines was found (OR = 1.121, 95% CI = [0.907–1.386], p-value = 0.291). Patients who had received two doses of the vaccine had significantly lower odds of mortality compared to those who had received one dose (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Vaccines are vital in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of this study show no difference between the Pfizer–BioNTech and Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccines in the rate of mortality. However, the number of vaccine doses was significantly associated with a lower risk of mortality. Future studies should examine the effectiveness of different COVID-19 vaccines using real-world data and more robust designs.

N2  - Background. Protection offered by five different forms of immunity, combining natural and vaccine immunity, was investigated against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection from Omicron BA.1 or BA.2, and severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 from BA.1 or BA.2, in Qatar, between December 23, 2021 and February 21, 2022. Methods. Six national, matched, test-negative case-control studies were conducted on a sample of 272,861 PCR-positive tests and 669,628 PCR-negative tests to estimate effectiveness of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine, mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine, natural immunity due to prior infection with pre-Omicron variants, and hybrid immunity from prior infection and vaccination. Results. Effectiveness of prior infection alone against symptomatic BA.2 infection was 46.1% (95% CI: 39.5-51.9%). Effectiveness of two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination alone was negligible at -1.1% (95% CI: -7.1-4.6), but nearly all individuals received their second dose >6 months earlier. Effectiveness of three-dose BNT162b2 vaccination alone was 52.2% (95% CI: 48.1-55.9%). Effectiveness of hybrid immunity of prior infection and two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was 55.1% (95% CI: 50.9-58.9%). Effectiveness of hybrid immunity of prior infection and three-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was 77.3% (95% CI: 72.4-81.4%). Meanwhile, prior infection, BNT162b2 vaccination, and hybrid immunity all showed strong effectiveness ( >70%) against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 due to BA.2. Similar patterns of effectiveness were observed for BA.1 and for the mRNA-1273 vaccine. Conclusion. There are no discernable differences between BA.1 and BA.2 in the effects of prior infection, vaccination, and hybrid immunity. Vaccination enhances the protection of those with a prior infection. Hybrid immunity resulting from prior infection and recent booster vaccination conferred the strongest protection.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Protection offered by five different forms of immunity, combining natural and vaccine immunity, was investigated against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron symptomatic BA.1 infection, symptomatic BA.2 infection, BA.1 hospitalization and death, and BA.2 hospitalization and death, in Qatar, between December 23, 2021 and February 21, 2022. METHODS: Six national, matched, test-negative case-control studies were conducted to estimate effectiveness of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine, mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine, natural immunity due to prior infection with pre-Omicron variants, and hybrid immunity from prior infection and vaccination. RESULTS: Effectiveness of only prior infection against symptomatic BA.2 infection was 46.1% (95% CI: 39.5-51.9%). Effectiveness of only two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was negligible at -1.1% (95% CI: -7.1-4.6), but nearly all individuals had received their second dose several months earlier. Effectiveness of only three-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was 52.2% (95% CI: 48.1-55.9%). Effectiveness of hybrid immunity of prior infection and two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was 55.1% (95% CI: 50.9-58.9%). Effectiveness of hybrid immunity of prior infection and three-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was 77.3% (95% CI: 72.4-81.4%). Meanwhile, prior infection, BNT162b2 vaccination, and hybrid immunity all showed strong effectiveness >70% against any severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 due to BA.2 infection. Similar levels and patterns of effectiveness were observed for BA.1 and for the mRNA-1273 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: There are no discernable differences in the effects of prior infection, vaccination, and hybrid immunity against BA.1 versus BA.2. Hybrid immunity resulting from prior infection and recent booster vaccination confers the strongest protection against either subvariant. Vaccination enhances protection of those with a prior infection.

N2  - Purpose: COVID-19 poses a disproportionate threat to renal transplant recipients (RTR), who are chronically immunosuppressed. Studies have indicated a 16% mortality rate compared to <5% for the general population. Effective vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna and, Johnson & Johnson) provided hope for protection against severe COVID-19 in this at-risk population. However, based on experience with vaccines against other viral infections, two primary concerns arose: 1) would the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines be effective in this population; 2) could these vaccines provoke rejection? Methods: To address these questions, we tested serum creatinine, anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody (Roche ElecsysR), Donor Specific anti HLA Antibodies, other antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, other coronaviruses (LABScreenTMCOVID Plus, One Lambda), and donor derived cell free DNA (dd-cfDNA; fraction, absolute and total quantity, using the ProsperaTM Test, Natera, Inc.) in RTR at the time of vaccine doses 1 and 2 and 1, 3, and 6 months after the second dose. dd-cfDNA ≥1% and 78 cp/ mL indicated an increased risk of rejection. 53 patients were consented and enrolled in the study. This study received IRB approval. Statistical analysis was performed using paired two-tailed student's t-test. Results: This preliminary analysis analyzed the impact of vaccination on dd-cfDNA levels in 31 RTR patients. This cohort was primarily female (67%) and of hispanic descent (48.3%) with a median age 55 years (range: 19-81). All but 1 patient received the Pfizer vaccination series. Mean time from transplant to vaccination 1 was 114.6 months (range: 10-359 months). Between vaccination 1 and 2, no patients had clinical suspicion of rejection, were hospitalized or underwent for-cause biopsy. No significant differences in dd-cfDNA or total cf-DNA levels were found by Prospera testing between vaccination 1 and 2. (Table 1). Between vaccination 1 and 2, one patient had an increase dd-cfDNA% above the normal range (0.14%, 2.37%), but absolute dd-cfDNA quantity remained in normal range (13.70 cp/mL, 66.08 cp/ mL). At the time of the vaccination 1, dd-cfDNA% was elevated in 2 patients. At vaccination 2, dd-cfDNA% had returned to the normal range for one patient (ddcfDNA quantity was normal for both vaccinations), while both dd-cfDNA% and quantity remained elevated in the other. Conclusions: Based on measurement of dd-cfDNA fraction, absolute quantity and total quantity with the Prospera test at vaccination 1 and 2, there was no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination-induced rejection.

N2  - In order to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the burden of disease, since 27 December 2020, Sicily has introduced a regional COVID-19 vaccination campaign. This study aimed at estimating the effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines on SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19. A retrospective cohort study was carried out on 3,966,976 Sicilian adults aged 18 years or more, who were followed-up from 1 January 2021 to 30 September 2021. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 in-fection, severe COVID-19, and COVID-19 death or intubation during the study period was compared among vaccinated with two mRNA doses and unvaccinated individuals. Cox regression, adjusted for age and sex, and a joint-point analysis on rate trends were performed. Overall, 2,469,320 (62.2%) subjects have been vaccinated and a total of 103,078 (2.6% of the entire population) SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects have been observed including 4693 (0.12%) severe COVID-19, 277 (0.01%) intubated, and 2649 (0.07%) deaths. After two months from vaccination, adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 81.3% against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 96.1% against severe COVID-19, and 93.4% against intubation/death. During the eight-month follow-up, statistically significant decreasing effectiveness trends were observed for all the evaluated outcomes (−4.76% per month against SARS-CoV-2 infection; −2.27% per month against severe COVID-19 and −2.26% per month against COVID-19 intubation/death). The study results confirm that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have high real-world effectiveness, especially in the first months after vaccination. The vaccine effectiveness decreases over time and, even if the decrease is relatively small against severe outcomes, the increasing protection wane suggests the need for booster vaccination campaigns.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of heterologous booster schedules with AZD1222 (Oxford-AstraZeneca, referred to as AZD), BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech, BNT), and mRNA-1273 (Moderna, MOD) vaccines compared with primary schedules and with homologous mRNA-vaccine booster schedules during a period of omicron predominance. Design: Population-based cohort analyses. Setting: Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, 27 December 2020 to 28 February 2022. Participants: Adults that had received at least a primary vaccination schedule (ie, two doses) of the AZD, BNT, and/or MOD vaccines during the study period. Main outcome measures: Using the Kaplan-Meier estimator, we compared country-specific risks of SARSCoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes in heterologous booster vaccinated with primary schedule vaccinated (matched analyses) and homologous booster vaccinated (weighted analyses) since emergence of omicron. Results: Heterologous booster schedules improved protection against all outcomes compared with primary schedules, with the largest and most robust effects observed for severe COVID-19. Risk differences for documented infection ranged from -22.4% to -3.1% (comparative vaccine effectiveness [CVE] 9.7% to 60.9%; >63.2% for COVID-19 hospitalisation) across countries for AZD1BNT2BNT3 (AZD as primary dose followed by two doses of BNT) vs AZD1BNT2 and -22.2% to -3.2% (CVE 37.4% to 67.8%; >34.6% for hospitalisation) for BNT1BNT2MOD3 vs BNT1BNT2, the two most common heterologous booster schedules. Heterologous- and homologous booster schedules had comparable effectiveness. Risk differences of documented infection ranged from -0.4% to 4.4% (CVE -20.0% to 2.4%) for AZD1BNT2BNT3 vs BNT1BNT2BNT3 and -19.8% to 1.7% (CVE -14.6% to 53.8%) for BNT1BNT2MOD3 vs BNT1BNT2BNT3; for most comparisons, risk differences for severe COVID-19 outcomes were smaller than 1 per 1000 vaccinated. Previous infection followed by a booster dose conferred the greatest protection. Conclusion: Heterologous booster vaccine schedules are associated with an increased protection against omicron-related COVID-19 outcomes that is comparable to that afforded by homologous booster schedules.

N2  - Given the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants and the roll-out of booster COVID-19 vaccination, evidence is needed on protection conferred by primary vaccination, booster vaccination and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection by variant. We employed a test-negative design and used multinomial logistic regression on data from community PCR testing in the Netherlands. S-gene target failure (SGTF) was used as proxy to discern Delta, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.2 infections. Two cohorts were defined to assess protection from vaccination and previous infection by variant: Delta-Omicron BA.1 cohort including data from 22 November 2021 to 7 January 2022 (n = 354,653) and Omicron BA.1-BA.2 cohort including data from 26 January to 31 March 2022 (n = 317,110). In the Delta-Omicron BA.1 cohort, including 39,889 Delta and 13,915 Omicron BA.1 infections, previous infection, primary vaccination or both protected well against Delta infection (76%, 71%, 92%, respectively, at 7+ months after infection or vaccination). Protection against Omicron BA.1 was much lower compared to Delta infections, but BA.1 estimates were imprecise. In the Omicron BA.1BA.2 cohort, including 67,887 BA.1 and 41,670 BA.2 infections, protection was similar against Omicron BA.1 compared to BA.2 infection for previous infection (34 and 38% at 7+ months post-infection), primary (39 and 32% at 7+ months post-vaccination) and booster vaccination (68 and 63% at 1 month post-vaccination). Higher protection was observed against all variants in individuals with both vaccination and previous infection compared with either one. Protection against all variants by either vaccination or infection decreased over time since last vaccination or infection. Primary vaccination with current COVID-19 vaccines and previous SARS-CoV-2 infections offer low protection against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 infection. Booster vaccination considerably increases protection against Omicron infection, but decreases rapidly after vaccination.

N2  - Concerns about the duration of protection conferred by COVID-19 vaccines have arisen in postlicensure evaluations. However, “depletion of susceptibles” bias driven by differential accrual of infection among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals may contribute to the appearance of waning vaccine effectiveness (VE) in epidemiologic studies, potentially hindering interpretation of estimates. We enrolled California residents who received molecular SARS-CoV-2 tests in a matched, test-negative design case-control study to estimate VE of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines between 23 February and 5 December 2021. We analyzed waning protection following 2 vaccine doses using conditional logistic regression models. Additionally, we used data from case-based surveillance along with estimated case-to-infection ratios from a population-based serological study to quantify the potential contribution of the “depletion-of-susceptibles” bias to time-varying VE estimates for 2 doses. We also estimated VE for 3 doses relative to 0 doses and 2 doses, by time since second dose receipt. Pooled VE of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was 91.3% (95% confidence interval: 83.8-95.4%) at 14 days after second-dose receipt and declined to 50.8% (31.2-75.6%) at 7 months. Accounting for differential depletion-of-susceptibles among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, we estimated VE was 53.2% (23.6-71.2%) at 7 months among individuals who had completed the primary series (2 doses). With receipt of a third dose of BN162b2 or mRNA-1273, VE increased to 95.0% (82.8-98.6%), compared with zero doses. These findings confirm that observed waning of protection is not attributable to epidemiologic bias and support ongoing efforts to administer additional vaccine doses to mitigate burden of COVID-19.

N2  - Background: The use of the mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2 against COVID-19 has shown great success preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population. Limited data exist regarding its effectiveness in patients requiring dialysis. Dialysis patients have reduced immune response following different types of vaccines including Hepatitis B vaccine. We aimed to asses humoral response and the factors associated with it in a large and diverse maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patient population. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 Anti-spike, anti-nucleocapsid and neutralizing antibody (Ab) levels of 424 MHD patients from 13 nationally spread dialysis units in Israel were compared with 155 control subjects (dialysis patients' family members and dialysis units health care workers). Patients' history, dialysis treatment details and Hepatitis B Ab (HBsAb) levels were obtained from dialysis units medical records. Results: Our study included 400 MHD patients and 141 controls (58% males, 42% females), excluding 24 MHD and 14 control samples from anti-N positive cases, signifying previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anti-S antibodies developed in 89.3% of MHD patients and 99.3% of controls, (p<0.01) after a median time of 82 and 89 days from second vaccine dose for MHD and controls, respectively. Median anti-S titer was significantly lower in MHD patients compared with controls (median 194, IQR 118-242 vs. 69, IQR 33-119; p<0.001) and correlated well with the level of neutralizing Ab titers in the study group as compared to control group (median 16, IQR 8-64 vs. 256, IQR 64-516; p<0.001, respectively). Notably, age was higher in MHD patients than controls (median 72, IQR 63-80 vs. 49, IQR 38-58, p<0.01) which likely contributed to the association with anti-S titers (p<0.01, r=0.44) as well as neutralizing Ab titer levels (p<0.01, r=0.42). Sex, dialysis vintage and etiology of ESRD were not significantly associated with anti-S positivity or titer levels. Interestingly, there was a significant correlation, between anti-S and HBsAb positivity (p<0.01) though campatability was low (r=0.18). Conclusions: MHD patients have lower seroconversion rate, lower anti-S and neutralizing Ab levels after BNT162b2 vaccination. HBsAb levels may potentially be used as a marker for estimating the level of humoral response following COVID-19 vaccine. To our knowledge this is the largest cohort of MHD patients studied thus far.

N2  - Background: Pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a major global health issue since December 2019. Patients affected by systemic rheumatic disorders represent a high-risk group for severe COVID-19. During the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination has become one of the cornerstones of the fght against this disease. The EULAR and the ACR recommend vaccination in all patients with rheumatological diseases. There is a paucity of data regarding the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases such as BehÇet's disease (BD). Objectives: In this study, we evaluated the safety and tolerance of COVID-19 vaccines, post-vaccine BD exacerbation and discontinuation of BD therapy in BD patients by retrospectively examining our BD cohort, from the patients' perspective. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 450 BD patients followed in our clinic using hospital records and formed a retrospective cohort of patients who met the International Study Group (ISG) criteria. COVID-19 vaccination status, vaccine type (inactivated or mRNA), post-vaccine side effects and exacerbations, drug compliance, change in treatment after exacerbation, and post-vaccine COVID-19 occurrence were evaluated by interviewing patients over the phone or face to face. Patient demographics, comorbid diseases, and active BD treatments were collected from our hospital records. Disease activity was measured using the BSAS and the BDCAF form. Results: Our cohort consisted of a total of 450 BD patients. Two hundred and eighty seven patients had at least 1 dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Of the total number of COVID-19 vaccines (n= 639), 379 (59%) were Pfzer-BionTech vaccines and 257 (41%) were Sinovac vaccines. The side-effects after frst, second, third and fourth vaccine dose were 151 (52.6%), 135 (47%), 29 (10.1%) and 3 (1%), respectively. BehÇet fare after frst, second, third and fourth vaccine dose were 151 (52.6%), 135 (47%), 16 (22.9%) and 3 (33.3%), respectively. The most common side effects were arm pain, joint pains or arthritis, malaise, while the most common BD exacerbations were arthralgia or arthritis, oral aphthae, pap-ulopustular eruption Pfzer-BionTech and Sinovac vaccines were compared in terms of side effects, there was a signifcant difference after the 1st (p<0.001) and 2nd doses (p<0.001), but no signifcant difference was found at the 3rd dose (p= 0.353) (Table 1). When Pfzer-BionTech and Sinovac vaccines were compared in terms of BD exacerbations, no signifcant difference was found after the 1st (p= 0.417), 2nd (p= 0.465) and 3rd doses (p= 0.565). Only 4 patients (1.3%) developed exacerbation with organ involvement after COVID-19 vaccine. Anterior uveitis developed in 2 patients, panuveitis in 1 patient, panuveitis and deep vein thrombosis in one patient. Conclusion: In conclusion, our study shows that the COVID-19 vaccine is well tolerated in BD patients, and that post-vaccine BehÇet's exacerbation predominantly includes mucocutaneous and articuler fndings, and exacerbations with organ involvement are rare. According to the COVID-19 vaccines, although the side effects were more in the Pfzer-BioNTech group compared to the Sinovac group, there was no difference between BehÇet's fare compared to the COVID-19 vaccines.

N2  - Background/Purpose: Patients with cancer exhibit increased mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the general population. SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in healthy individuals generates effective and long-lasting immune protection against COVID-19. PD-1 is highly expressed on the surface of T follicular helper cells that play a central role in T cell dependent B cell vaccine responses. Here, we sought to investigate the cellular and humoral responses in patients on PD-1 immunotherapy after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination, with a particular focus on patients developing immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Methods: We investigated the longitudinal induction of antigen-specific antibody, B cell and T cell responses in patients with melanoma on anti-PD-1 immunotherapy (aPD-1, n = 44) receiving a 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine regimen during 6 distinct timepoints over the course of 9 months (Figure 1). We compared these responses against an established cohort of healthy control individuals (HC, n=45). All individuals included in this study were not previously infected with SARSCoV-2. Incidence of irAEs in the aPD-1 patients was determined with retrospective chart review. Results: After a 2-dose mRNA vaccine regimen, a-PD1 patients had lower levels of anti-Spike IgG after the first vaccine dose (V2) and lower levels of anti-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) IgG after the first and second dose (V2 and V4) compared to healthy controls (Figure 2). Within the aPD-1 patient group, patients with irAEs demonstrated a trend towards lower anti-Spike and anti-RBD IgG compared to patients with no irAEs (Figure 3). Vaccine-specific memory B cells (mBCs) recognizing Spike and RBD were generated in patients on aPD-1 therapies to an extent equivalent to healthy controls. The mBCs from aPD-1 patients efficiently recognized the Alpha, Beta and Delta variants of concern (VOC) of SARS-CoV-2 but exhibited diminished recognition of the Omicron variant at 2 months after the 2nd vaccination (V5). This defect improved over time, with mBCs from aPD-1 patients recognizing the Omicron VOC at levels similar to the control group by 6-9 months following primary vaccination (V6). Finally, using a peptide pool of the wild-type Spike protein, we found that all aPD-1 patients generated antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses following vaccination. Nevertheless, when tested with an omicron-specific peptide pool, the abundance of antigen-specific CD4 T cells, but not CD8 T cells, from patients on aPD-1 immunotherapy was lower than that of healthy controls. Conclusion: These results indicated that patients on aPD-1 immunotherapeutics generate productive humoral and cellular vaccine-specific responses against the wild-type Spike protein following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. However, they also demonstrated diminished B cell and CD4 T cell recognition of the immune-evasive Omicron variant. In addition, patients with irAEs showed some of the lower serological responses among all the individuals tested. The qualitative defects seen in patients on aPD-1 therapy highlight the importance of the PD-1 pathway in promoting fully functional vaccine responses, suggesting possibly a more pressing need for these patients to receive booster vaccinations.

N2  - Background: It has recently been suggested that influenza vaccination may be a factor associated with decreased COVID-19 mortality. Methods: An age-matched case-control study based on hospital cases. We included subjects aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of moderate to severe COVID-19. Infection was corroborated by RT-PCR test for SARS-COV-2. Deceased subjects were considered cases, controls were patients discharged due to improvement of acute symptoms. We used bivariate analysis to determine factors associated with death from COVID-19, and calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Results: A total of 560 patients were included in the study, 214 (38.2%) were considered cases and 346 (61.7%) controls. A significant difference was observed with the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus [54% vs. 39.3% between cases and controls, respectively (p=.04)] and having received influenza vaccination (p=.02). Type 2 diabetes mellitus was associated with higher COVID-19 mortality [OR 1.8 (95% CI 1.2-2.5) p=.01], whereas having been immunised against influenza in 2019 was associated with lower mortality in this group of patients [OR.6 (95% CI.4-.9) p=.02]. Conclusions: Influenza vaccination in the previous year appears to be associated with lower mortality from COVID-19; whereas type 2 diabetes mellitus is confirmed as a condition associated with higher mortality.

N2  - In February 2021, Peru launched a vaccination campaign among healthcare personnel using BBIBP-CorV inactivated whole virus (BBIBP-CorV) COVID-19 vaccine. Two doses of BBIBP-CorV vaccine are recommended, 21 days apart. Data on BBIBP-CorV vaccine effectiveness will inform the use and acceptance of vaccination with BBIBP-CorV vaccine. We evaluated BBIBP-CorV vaccine effectiveness among an existing multi-year influenza cohort at two hospitals in Lima. We analyzed data on 290 participants followed between February and May 2021. Participants completed a baseline questionnaire and provided weekly self-collected anterior nasal swabs tested for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR for sixteen weeks. We performed multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for pre-selected characteristics (age, sex, exposure to COVID-19 patients, work in intensive care unit or emergency department, BMI, and exposure time in days). BBIBP-CorV vaccine effectiveness was calculated after the two-week post-vaccination period as (1-Odds Ratio for testing SARS-CoV-2 positive)x100%. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by rRT-PCR among 25 (9%) participants during follow-up (February-May 2021). Follow-up period ranged 1-11 weeks (median: 2 weeks). Among cohort participants who were fully vaccinated the adjusted vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated as 95% (95% CI: 70%, 99%) and 100% (95% CI: 88%, 100%) for those partially vaccinated. During the study period, vaccination of healthcare personnel with BBIBP-CorV vaccine was effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections in the weeks immediately following vaccination. This information can be used to support vaccination efforts in the region, especially among those who could be concerned about their effectiveness.

N2  - Waning immunity to vaccination represents a major challenge in vaccinology. Whether booster vaccination improves the durability of immune responses is unknown. Here we show, using a cohort of 55 adult vaccinees who received the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, that a booster (i.e., 3rd immunization) dose at 6 - 10 months increased the half-life of serum neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers to 76 days from 56 - 66 days estimated after the primary two-dose vaccination series. A second booster dose (i.e., 4th immunization) more than a year after the primary vaccination increased the half-life further to 88 days. However, despite this modestly improved durability in nAb responses against the Wuhan strain, there was a loss in neutralization capacity against Omicron subvariants, especially the recently emerged variants, BA.2.75.2 and BQ.1.1 (35 and 50-fold drop in titers respectively, relative to the ancestral (WA.1) strain. While only 55 – 65% of participants demonstrated a detectable nAb titer against the newer variants after the booster (3rd dose), the response declined to below the detection limit in almost all individuals by 6 months. Notably, even against BA.1 and BA.5, the titers declined rapidly in a third of the vaccinees and were below the detection limit at 6 months. In contrast, booster vaccination induced antigen-specific memory B and T cells that persisted for at least 6 months. Collectively, our data show that the durability of immune responses improves following subsequent booster immunizations; however, the emergence of immune evasive variants reduces the effectiveness of booster doses in preventing infection.

N2  - Introduction: The novel Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is seen to primarily affect the human respiratory system. Chest CT Severity Score (CTSS) provides a semi quantitative assessment of pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 pandemic mitigation measures such as SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are being deployed worldwide. However, with the emerging variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2, a high prevalence of post vaccination breakthrough infections is seen. Aim: To assess the association of CTSS with the vaccination status in a cohort of COVID-19 patients referred to a tertiary diagnostic centre and to evaluate the association of CTSS with other clinical parameters including co-morbidities in these patients. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional observational study was conducted at a tertiary care diagnostic imaging centre in the city of Pune, Maharashtra, India. Data of 1002 symptomatic, adult patients who underwent chest CT and SARS-CoV-2 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)/Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) laboratory test between March 13, 2021 and June 22, 2021, were collected. COVID-19 reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) categories and the corresponding semi quantitative CTSS were calculated for each patient. Based on their vaccination status, patients were categorised into three groups: unvaccinated, partially vaccinated and fully vaccinated. The association of CTSS with various categories of vaccination status, demographics, co-morbidities and stages of the disease of the patients, was evaluated. Results: Of the 1002 COVID-19 patients, 768 (76.6%) were unvaccinated, 190 (19.0%) were partially vaccinated and 44 (4.4%) were fully vaccinated. Mean CTSS in the fully vaccinated cohort was significantly lower (3.75±4.7) than that in the partially vaccinated (6.05±5.7) and unvaccinated (8.29±4.9) patients (mean 3.75 vs. 6.05 vs. 8.29, respectively; (p<0.05). Mean CTSS in patients with no co-morbidities was significantly lower than that in patients with hypertension and diabetes (7.12 vs. 8.75 vs. 10.39, respectively; (p<0.05). Conclusion: Significant association was noted between the Chest CTSS and the vaccination status, age, gender, co-morbidities and stage of disease in this large cohort of COVID-19 patients. The study reiterates that full vaccination aids in reducing the severity of lung involvement in COVID-19 infection.

N2  - Background: To date there are 3 FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines: BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and Ad26.COV.2.S. The clinical trials behind these approvals did not test vaccines in immunocompromised patients nor stratify patients with various comorbidities. Therefore, the aim was to compare adverse outcomes in vaccinated patients with and without psoriasis. Design: A retrospective analysis was conducted using TriNetX, a real-time multicenter database, from December 2020-May 2021. A 1:1 matched propensity score analysis was conducted, adjusting for comorbidities and demographics, to generate adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) with 95% CI. Outcomes included breakthrough COVID infections, 1-day anaphylaxis, 30- and 60-day follow-up for all-cause hospitalization, and FDA-defined adverse events of special interest (AESI). Subgroup analysis was also conducted for those with a 1-year history of methotrexate or TNF inhibitor use. Summary: From the 904,952 patients who received a COVID-19 vaccine, 1.1% had psoriasis. After matching, there were no differences between cohorts for 1-day anaphylaxis or for 30- and 60-day all-cause hospitalization or AESIs. However, vaccinated psoriatic patients were at a higher risk for new COVID infection in 30-day (RR = 2.67 [1.6-4.5]) and 60-day follow up (RR = 2.09 [1.4-3.2]). Subgroup analysis revealed no difference in any assessed outcomes for those with a 1-year history of methotrexate or TNF inhibitors. Conclusion: These results show that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective for psoriatic patients. Although breakthrough infection had a higher risk in the psoriatic cohort, the overall prevalence was still <0.6%. Further research is warranted to study the impacts of vaccination on psoriatic patients, especially in more severe forms.

N2  - Introduction: Considering the uncontrolled pandemic there is an urgent need for studies on the safety profile of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccination in children with chronic kidney conditions. Currently in Turkey COVID-19 vaccines are in use for the adolescent population. We aimed to investigate the side-effect and safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines available for adolescents with chronic kidney disease (CKD) at our center. Material and methods: The study population included patients with CKD stage 2-5, glomerular disease treated with immunosuppression, patients on dialysis, and kidney transplant recipients followed-up during the pandemic. A questionnaire including demographic and medical information, history of COVID-19 infection, vaccination status, and vaccinerelated side effects was administered to the patients. Results: Ninety eight patients (55 girls, 43 boys) were vaccinated by CoronaVac-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (n=16) or BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 (n= 82) vaccine. The mean age was 16.90 ± 2,36 years and median follow-up 4,9 (0,5-11,03) months. There were 36 stage 2-5 CKD, 8 dialysis, and 24 transplant patients in the cohort. The most common side effects were local pain (46,9 %), fatigue (17,3 %) and fever (11,2 %). No serious side effects were observed. Median duration of the symptoms was 2 (1-30) days. The longest symptom took 30 days; as dizziness in one patient with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. No renal disease flare was observed post-vaccination and 11 (11,2 %) patients experienced mild COVID-19 infection (according to NIH criteria). Although side effects with mRNA seemed more frequent than the inactivated vaccine, it was statistically insignificant (p=0,10). No significant relationship was found between frequency of side effects and age, glomerular filtration rate, immunosuppressive treatments, CKD stage, and the underlying disease. Conclusions: Although studies with longer follow-up are needed to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, our early experience showed that vaccination is safe in the young population with CKD.

N2  - Background. Major side effects after vaccination can be caused by a reactive immune system. We investigate statistical association between severity of self-reported reactions to immunisation with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and immunological response (SARS-CoV-2 spike immunoglobulin [IgG]) using data from ENFORCE, an openlabel, non-randomised, parallel group, phase IV study that enrolled over 6500 Danish adult citizens prior to their first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Methods. Participants were included with assessments of self-reported reactions 1-2 weeks after vaccination and subsequent assessment of total serum levels of SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG at the next visit, before next vaccine dose. A severity score was defined based on 7 systemic reactions (muscle pain, joint pain, fatigue, fever, headache, nausea, chills) scored as moderate (+1) or severe (+2) with a maximum score of 14. Linear regression was used to test association between severity score and log-transformed spike IgG after first and second vaccinations, adjusted for time from vaccination to spike IgG assessment, age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, vaccine type, evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also looked at the effect of adjusting for spike IgG level measured prior to each dose. Results. Of 6918 eligible ENFORCE participants, 6192 and 5937 were included for first and second vaccinations, respectively, with characteristics displayed in Table 1. Adjusted geometric mean ratios are presented in Table 2. Following first vaccination, no significant association was found between severity score and spike IgG (p=0.537). Following second vaccination, the association was highly significant (p< 0.001) with scores of 2 or more having up to 25% higher spike IgG level than a score of 0. When pre-dose spike IgG was subsequently adjusted for (Table 3), the association was no longer significant (p=0.530). assessment, age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), vaccine type, and evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Means and differences were back-transformed to present geometric means, ratios, and 95% confidence intervals. Conclusion. An average of 4 weeks after first vaccination, the SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG level was similar regardless of severity of reactions experienced. Around 9 weeks after second vaccination, those who had at least 2 moderate or 1 severe reaction had a significantly higher spike IgG level than those with no moderate/severe reactions. However, adjustment for pre-existing immunity attenuated the association and warrants further investigation.

N2  - Waning immunity following administration of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines remains a concern for many health systems. We undertook a study to determine if recent reports of waning for severe disease could have been attributed to design-related bias by conducting a study only among those detected with a first SARS-CoV-2 infection. We used a matched case-control study design with the study base being all individuals with first infection with SARS-CoV-2 reported in the State of Qatar between 1 January 2021 and 20 February 2022. Cases were those detected with first SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring intensive care (hard outcome), while controls were those detected with first SARS-CoV-2 infection who recovered without the need for intensive care. Cases and controls were matched in a 1:30 ratio for the calendar month of infection and the comorbidity category. Duration and magnitude of conditional vaccine effectiveness against requiring intensive care and the number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent one more case of COVID-19 requiring intensive care was estimated for the mRNA (BNT162b2/mRNA-1273) vaccines. Conditional vaccine effectiveness against requiring intensive care was 59% (95% confidence interval (CI), 50 to 76) between the first and second dose, and strengthened to 89% (95% CI, 85 to 92) between the second dose and 4 months post the second dose in persons who received a primary course of the vaccine. There was no waning of vaccine effectiveness in the period from 4 to 6, 6 to 9, and 9 to 12 months after the second dose. This study demonstrates that, contrary to mainstream reports using hierar-chical measures of effectiveness, conditional vaccine effectiveness against requiring intensive care remains robust till at least 12 months after the second dose of mRNA-based vaccines.

N2  - Background: Results of a randomised trial showed the safety and efficacy of GamCOVIDVac against COVID19. However, compared to other vaccines used across the globe, the realworld data on the effectiveness of GamCOVIDVac, especially against the disease caused by Delta variant of concern, was not available. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of vaccination mainly conducted with GamCOVIDVac in St. Petersburg, Russia. Methods: We designed a casecontrol study to assess the vaccine effectiveness (VE) against lung injury and referral to hospital. Selfreported vaccination status was collected for individuals with confirmed SARSCoV2 infection who were referred for initial lowdose computed tomography triage in two outpatient centres in July 3 - August 9, 2021 in St. Petersburg, Russia. We used logistic regression models to estimate the adjusted (for age, sex, and triage centre) VE for complete (>14 days after the second dose) vaccination. We estimated the VE against referral for hospital admission, COVID19related lung injury assessed with LDCT, and decline in oxygen saturation. Results: In the final analysis, 13,893 patients were included, 1,291 (9.3%) of patients met our criteria for complete vaccination status, and 495 (3.6%) were referred to hospital. In the primary analysis, the adjusted VE against referral to hospital was 81% (95% CI: 68-88) for complete vaccination. The VE against referral to hospital was more pronounced in women (84%, 95% CI: 66-92) compared to men (76%, 95% CI: 51-88). Vaccine protective effect increased with increasing lung injury categories, from 54% (95% CI: 48-60) against any sign of lung injury to 76% (95% CI: 59-86) against more than 50% lung involvement. A sharp increase was observed in the probability of hospital admission with age for nonvaccinated patients in relation to an almost flat relationship for the completely vaccinated group. Conclusions: COVID19 vaccination was effective against referral to hospital in patients with symptomatic SARSCoV2 infection in St. Petersburg, Russia. This protection is probably mediated through VE against lung injury associated with COVID19.

N2  - Background. The elderly are highly vulnerable to severe Covid-19. Waning immunity and emergence of Omicron have caused concerns about reduced effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines. The objective was to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against severe Covid-19 among the elderly. Methods. This nationwide, register-based cohort analysis included all residents aged 70 years and over in Finland. The follow-up started on December 27, 2020, and ended on March 31, 2022. The outcomes of interest were Covid-19-related hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission timely associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. VE was estimated as one minus the hazard ratio comparing the vaccinated and unvaccinated and taking into account time since vaccination. Omicron-specific VE was evaluated as the effectiveness observed since January 1, 2022. Results. The cohort included 896220 individuals. Comirnaty (BioNTech/Pfizer) VE against Covid-19-related hospitalization was 93% (95% CI 89%–95%) and 85% (95% CI 82%–87%) 14–90 and 91–180 days after the second dose; VE increased to 95% (95% CI 94%–96%) 14–60 days after the third dose. VE of other homologous and heterologous three dose series was similar. Protection against severe Covid-19 requiring ICU treatment was even better. Since January 1, 2022, Comirnaty VE was 98% (95% CI 92%–99%) and 92% (95% CI 87%–95%) 14–90 and 91–180 days after the second and 98% (95% CI 95%–99%) 14–60 days after the third dose. Conclusions. VE against severe Covid-19 is high among the elderly. It waned slightly after two doses, but a third restored the protection. VE against severe Covid-19 remained high even after the emergence of Omicron.

N2  - Background: Occupational disparities in COVID-19 vaccine uptake can impact the effectiveness of vaccination programmes and introduce particular risk for vulnerable workers and those with high workplace exposure. This study aimed to investigate COVID-19 vaccine uptake by occupation, including for vulnerable groups and by occupational exposure status. Methods: We used data from employed or self-employed adults who provided occupational information as part of the Virus Watch prospective cohort study (n=19,595) and linked this to study-obtained information about vulnerability-relevant characteristics (age, medical conditions, obesity status) and work-related COVID-19 exposure based on the Job Exposure Matrix. Participant vaccination status for the first, second, and third dose of any COVID-19 vaccine was obtained based on linkage to national records and study records. We calculated proportions and Sison-Glaz multinomial 95% confidence intervals for vaccine uptake by occupation overall, by vulnerability-relevant characteristics, and by job exposure. Findings: Vaccination uptake across occupations ranged from 89-96% for the first dose, 87-94% for the second dose, and 75-86% for the third dose, with transport, trade, service and sales workers persistently demonstrating the lowest uptake. Vulnerable workers tended to demonstrate fewer between-occupational differences in uptake than non-vulnerable workers, although clinically vulnerable transport workers (76%-89% across doses) had lower uptake than several other occupational groups (maximum across doses 86-96%). Workers with low SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk had higher vaccine uptake (86%-96% across doses) than those with elevated or high risk (81-94% across doses). Interpretation: Differential vaccination uptake by occupation, particularly amongst vulnerable and highly-exposed workers, is likely to worsen occupational and related socioeconomic inequalities in infection outcomes. Further investigation into occupational and non-occupational factors influencing differential uptake is required to inform relevant interventions for future COVID-19 booster rollouts and similar vaccination programmes.

N2  - INTRODUCTION We provide national estimates of the real-world Vaccine effectiveness (VE) based on nationally available surveillance data. The study aimed to estimate the effectiveness of the inactivated Covid-19 vaccine BBIBP-CorV (Vero Cells) Sinopharm vaccine currently deployed in Morocco to reduce the risk of hospitalization from a severe infection of SARS- CoV-2 virus within 9 months after vaccination. METHODS We conducted a test-negative, case-control study among a population aged 18 years or older who were tested by rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection from February to October 2021 in Morocco. From the national laboratory COVID-19 database; we identified cases who were rt-PCR positive amongst severe and critical COVID-19 cases and controls who had a negative rt-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. From the national vaccination register (NVR); individuals vaccinated with COVID-19 Vaccine (Vero Cell) and those unvaccinated were identified and included in the study. The linkage between databases was conducted for the study of Vaccination status based on the timing of the vaccine receipt relative to the SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR test date. For each person, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, we identified a propensity score-matched control participant who was tested negative. We estimated vaccine effectiveness using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS Among 12884 persons who tested positive and 12885 propensity score-matched control participants, the median age was 62 years, 47.2% of whom were female. As a function of time after vaccination of second dose vaccination, vaccine effectiveness during the first month was 88% (95% CI, 84-91), 87% (95% CI: 83-90) during the second and third month, 75% (95% CI: 67-80) during the fourth month, 61% (95% CI: 54-67) during the fifth month, and 64% (95% CI: 59-69) beyond the sixth month. VE remained high and stable during the first three months in the two-age subgroup. In the fourth month, the VE in the older population aged 60 years and above (64%) was reduced by 20 points compared to VE in the younger population (84%). CONCLUSION A Sinopharm vaccine is highly protective against serious SARS-CoV-2 infection under real-world conditions. Protection remained high and stable during the first three months following the second dose and decreases slightly beyond the fourth month especially beyond 60 years.

N2  - Background Patients with kidney failure requiring kidney replacement therapy (KRT) are at high risk of complications and death following SARS-CoV-2 infection with variable antibody responses to vaccination reported. We investigated the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on incidence of infection, hospitalization and death of COVID-19 infection. Methods Study design was an observational data linkage cohort study. Multiple healthcare datasets were linked to ascertain all SARS-CoV-2 testing, vaccination, hospitalization, and mortality data for all patients treated with KRT in Scotland, from the start of the pandemic over a period of 20 months. Descriptive statistics, survival analyses and vaccine effectiveness were calculated. Results As of 19th September 2021, 93% (n=5281) of the established KRT population in Scotland had received two doses of an approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Over the study period, there were 814 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (15.1% of the KRT population). Vaccine effectiveness against infection and hospitalization was 33% (95% CI 0-52) and 38% (95% CI 0-57) respectively. 9.2% of fully vaccinated individuals died within 28 days of a SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR test (7% dialysis patients and 10% kidney transplant recipients). This compares to <0.1% of the vaccinated Scottish population being admitted to hospital or dying death due to COVID19 during that period. Conclusions These data demonstrate a primary vaccine course of two doses has limited impact on COVID-19 infection and its complications in patients treated with KRT. Adjunctive strategies to reduce risk of both COVID-19 infection and its complications in this population are urgently required.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Vaccination has been effective in ameliorating the impact of COVID-19. However, estimation of vaccine effectiveness (VE) is still unavailable for some widely used vaccines and underrepresented groups. Here, we report on the effectiveness of a nationwide COVID-19 vaccination program in Mexico. METHODS: We used a test-negative design within a national COVID-19 surveillance system to assess VE of the BNT162b2, mRNA-12732, Gam-COVID-Vac, Ad5-nCoV, Ad26.COV2.S, ChAdOx1 and CoronaVac vaccines, against SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related hospitalization and death for adults ≥18 years in Mexico. VE was estimated using Cox proportional hazard models considering time-varying vaccination status in partial and fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated adults, adjusted by age, sex, comorbidities and municipality. We also estimated VE for adults ≥60 years, for cases with diabetes and comparing periods with predominance of variants B.1.1.519 and B.1.617.2. RESULTS: We assessed 793,487 vaccinated compared to 4,792,338 unvaccinated adults between December 24th, 2020, and September 27th, 2021. VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection was highest for fully vaccinated individuals with mRNA-12732 (91.5%, 95%CI 90.3-92.4) and Ad26.COV2.S (82.2%, 95%CI 81.4-82.9), whereas for COVID-19 related hospitalization were BNT162b2 (84.3%, 95%CI 83.6-84.9) and Gam-COVID-Vac (81.4% 95%CI 79.5-83.1) and for mortality BNT162b2 (89.8%, 95%CI 89.2-90.2) and mRNA-12732 (93.5%, 95%CI 86.0-97.0). VE for all evaluated vaccines was reduced for adults ≥60 years, people with diabetes, and in periods of Delta variant predominance. CONCLUSIONS: All evaluated vaccines were effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related hospitalization and death. Mass vaccination campaigns with multiple vaccine products are feasible and effective to maximize vaccination coverage.

N2  - Background: Efficacy and safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines had been acquired from phase III studies. Nevertheless, cancer patients were not represented in these trials. In 1/2021 mass vaccination of high-risk population, including cancer patients, was initiated in Israel. We aimed to prospectively evaluate efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of BNT162b2 vaccine in cancer patients. Methods: Cancer patients on active treatment were prospectively enrolled following first dose of BNT162b2 or after a second dose. Serum was collected after each dose and additionally in case of seronegativity. An age-matched cohort of healthcare workers served as controls. Questionnaires regarding sociodemographics and adverse reactions were employed at serum collection. FDA-approved assay was used to assess IgG at all time-points. Patients’ electronic medical records were reviewed for documentation of COVID-19 infection, blood counts, liver enzymes and imaging studies. Results: The study included 232 cancer patients and 261 controls. Following first dose 29% of patients were seropositive compared with 84% of controls (p<0.001). Following second dose seropositive rate reached 86%. Rate per 1000-person days after first dose were 12.5 for patients and 48.5 for controls. Chemotherapy reduced immunogenicity (OR 0.41 (95%CI 0.17-0.98). In seronegative patients, rate of documented leukopenia reached 39%. No COVID19 cases were documented throughout the study period except two cases following the first dose. Reported adverse events resembled former published studies. Conclusions: Our results indicate the BNT162b2 appear to be safe and effective in cancer patients. There is a pronounced lag in antibody production compared with non-cancer controls, however seroconversion occurred in most patients after the second dose. Future real-world data is warranted to determine the long-term efficacy of the vaccine with regard to type of anti-cancer treatment. Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors.

N2  - Objectives and Study: COVID 19 vaccines, including mRNA vaccine, have demonstrated excellent efficacy in phase 3 clinical trials. Since patients with immune-mediated conditions were excluded from clinical trials, it is important to describe real-world data regarding vaccine effectiveness. In this population-based study, we used our large validated, comprehensive coeliac disease autoimmunity (CDA) patients cohort, based on their anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA level, to explore the effectiveness of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We conducted a large population-based cohort study in Maccabi healthcare services (MHS), a 2.5 million-member health organization operating in Israel. In the primary analysis, the cohort included all patients with validated CDA who were fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with matched patients based on birth year, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), and month of first vaccine dose in a 1:3 ratio. The study included vaccinated patients age ≥12 years with CDA with a minimum of two BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses. Patients with CDA were then divided into subgroups based on their positive tTG-IgA level at diagnosis and their current status based on the last tTG-IgA results within the last two years. Patients with anti-tTG IgA, more than 10 times the upper limit of the normal range, were considered patients with near-certain coeliac disease. Kaplan Meier survival analyses were performed to evaluate time to breakthrough infection with SARSCoV-2, defined as a positive PCR result 14 days post-second vaccination date. Patients with CDA and their matched patients were compared via the Log-rank test. Multivariate cox regression analyses and hazard ratio assessment with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: In this study 7,083 patients with CDA were identified in the MHS database with two confirmed COVID-19 vaccinations and no prior record of a positive PCR test. After matching, there were 5,381 patients with CDA matched to 14,939 patients without any record of tTG-IgA testing. The mean age in years for the CDA and matched patients was 33.38 (17.78) and 33.93 (17.68), respectively. Vaccine effectiveness was evaluated with Kaplan Meier survival analysis among the full cohort (CDA n=5,381 and matched patients n=14,939) to evaluate time to breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection, where there was no observed statistical difference between groups (p=0.71, Figure 1). A Cox regression survival analysis was performed with the cohort, where the hazard ratio for breakthrough infection among CDA patients was 0.91 (95% CI = 0.77, 1.09). The same models were applied, and similar results were obtained for patients with near-certain coeliac disease, well-controlled patients with CDA, likely not well-controlled patients with CDA, and newly diagnosed patients with CDA. Conclusions: In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first reports of real-world COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in patients with CDA. Overall vaccine effectiveness was excellent and comparable to the reference population.

N2  - To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, a mass vaccination campaign was initiated in Italy on December 27, 2020. The vaccine available to immunize Italian healthcare workers (HCWs) was the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty). This study evaluated the effectiveness of the vaccine against documented SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptomatic diseases in the medium- to long-term. HCWs at Bari Policlinico University-Hospital (Italy) who completed the vaccination schedule were matched with HCWs who had refused vaccination; the two groups were followed-up for 5 months (January–May 2021). Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection was 97.7% (95.4– 99.0%) at 14–34 days after the first dose, and 94.8% (87.0–97.8%), 83.0% (65.0–92.0%), and 81.0% (42.0–94.0%) at 14–41, 42–69, and >69 days, respectively, after the second dose. The estimated VE for documented symptomatic disease was 99.2% (96.4–99.8%) at 14–34 days after the first dose and 97.2% (90.3–99.2%), 85.0% (63.0–94.2%), and 88.0% (42.0–97.6%) at 14–41, 42–69, and >69 days, respectively, after the second dose. Efforts to increase vaccination rates should be strengthened, including mandatory vaccination for HCWs and greater incentives to increase vaccine acceptance by the general population.

N2  - We compared vaccine effectiveness (VE) against severe COVID-19 during calendar periods from December 2021 to March 2022 when Omicron BA.1 and BA.2, respectively, were the dominating virus variants in Scania county, Sweden. We used continuous density case-control sampling matched for sex and age, and with further adjustment for differences in comorbidities and prior infection. VE remained relatively stable after the transition from BA.1 to BA.2 among people with at least three doses but decreased markedly among those with only two doses. Protection from prior infection was also lower after the transition to BA.2. These findings suggest that booster vaccination is needed to maintain sufficient protection against severe COVID-19.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 vaccines, face masks, and social distancing are effective interventions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. In this study, we aimed to determine lung cancer patients’ attitudes toward vaccination, changes in behavior after vaccination, and willingness to continue mask wearing after the pandemic. Methods: We sent out questionnaires to 220 thoracic oncology patients treated at our lung cancer center in May 2021. The questionnaire focused on patients’ vaccination status, self-reported experiences surrounding vaccination, and assessed changes in behaviors before and after vaccination as well as opinions toward mask wearing after the pandemic. Results are presented as absolute and relative frequencies and means with standard deviation and compared using t test, paired t test, and analysis of variance test as well as chi2 test, and Fisher exact text. Results: About 91.0% of patients reported having received at least 1 vaccination. About 73.3% of patients reported having at least 1 reaction to the vaccination. The most common reactions were pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. After vaccination, patients increased contact with family and friends, use of public transport, and grocery shopping. Overall, the level of willingness to wear masks beyond the end of the pandemic differed according to vaccination status. Conclusions: Acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccination among thoracic oncology patients in Germany was high. Overall, patients with thoracic malignancies tolerated the COVID-19 vaccination well. Rate of adverse reaction was not higher compared with the general population. After the vaccination, patients increased social contacts and usage of public transport. These changes suggest positive psychological effects on quality of life. While reducing social distancing can increase the risk of infection, our results indicate that an extension of mask mandates after the pandemic would likely be accepted by a majority of thoracic oncology patients, suggesting that our cohort was still aware and in support of other measure of protection.

N2  - Study question: What is the effect of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines on oocyte donors regarding oocyte quality, embryo development and clinical outcomes? Summary answer: Oocyte quality, fertilization, blastocyst formation, embryo quality and pregnancy rates were similar following donors' mRNA SARSCoV- 2 vaccination compared to previous oocyte donation cycles. What is known already: The severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, urged scientists to develop safe and effective vaccines. During the ongoing pandemic, the scientific community has promoted vaccination programs to reduce morbidity and mortality. While it has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection might impact fertility, limited evidence shows that vaccination has no influence on sperm parameters, follicular steroidogenesis, or oocyte quality and only one study reported no effects on fertilization or top-quality embryos rate in vaccinated patients undergoing IVF. There is a paucity of evidence with regards to younger population undergoing ovarian stimulation. Study design, size, duration: This prospective, multicentre cohort study evaluated 32 oocyte donors with two controlled and similar ovarian stimulation, before and after complete SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, between November 2020 and January 2022. A total of 64 oocyte recipient cycles were analysed equally separately into these two groups. Severe male factor was excluded. Participants/materials, setting, methods: Complete SARS-CoV-2 vaccination of the oocyte donor made the difference between the two groups of recipients analysed. The time frame between the previous ovarian stimulation and the vaccination was lower than 8 months. We evaluated and compared the rates of matured eggs (metaphase II, MII), the fertilization and blastocyst formation rates, blastocyst quality (A/B ASEBIR categories), positive pregnancy test and clinical pregnancy rates in both groups of recipients. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Main results and the role of chance: The average number of MII collected were similar before and following vaccination (12.23 vs 12.91, p=0.198, respectively). In recipients, the outcomes with regards to fertilization rate (81.4% vs 77.3% p=0.210), blastocyst formation rate (60.2% vs 61.5%, p=0.771) and high-quality blastocysts (quality A: 31.1% vs 36.4% and quality B: 29.0% vs 25.1%, p=0.430) did not differ statistically between the control group (n=32, pre-vaccination) and the study group (n=32, post-vaccination), respectively. Furthermore, regarding clinical outcomes, there were not statistically differences in pregnancy rates (64.0% vs 77.4%, p=0.269) or clinical pregnancy rates (60.0% vs 64.5%, p=0.729) before and after vaccination respectively. Limitations, reasons for caution: Our encouraging results should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size and the short period of follow- up. Larger controlled trials are needed to corroborate our findings as the countries continue making forward with the vaccination campaign. Wider implications of the findings: The present study suggests no influence of mRNA SARS-CoV2 vaccines on donor oocyte cycles, reflecting no detrimental effects on the assisted reproduction outcomes. The safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination concerning IVF cycles is encouraging for the medical community and the health of our patients.

N2  - Objective: To estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) for preventing COVID-19 hospital admission in women first infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy, and assess how this compares to VE among women of reproductive age who were not pregnant when first infected. Design: Population-based cohort study using national, linked Census and administrative data. Setting: England, United Kingdom, from 8th December 2020 to 31st August 2021. Participants: 815,4777 women aged 18 to 45 years (mean age, 30.4 years) who had documented evidence of a first SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHS Test and Trace data or Hospital Episode Statistics. Main outcome measures: A hospital inpatient episode where COVID-19 was recorded as the primary diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for calendar time of infection and sociodemographic factors related to vaccine uptake and risk of severe COVID-19, were used to estimate VE as the complement of the hazard ratio for COVID-19 hospital admission. Results: Compared with unvaccinated pregnant women, the adjusted rate of COVID-19 hospital admission was 76% (95% confidence interval 69% to 82%) lower for single-vaccinated pregnant women and 83% (75% to 88%) lower for double-vaccinated pregnant women. These estimates were similar to those found for non-pregnant women: 79% (76% to 81%) for single-vaccinated and 82% (80% to 83%) for double-vaccinated. Among those vaccinated more than 90 days before infection, being double-vaccinated was associated with a greater reduction in risk than being single-vaccinated. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccination is associated with reduced rates of severe illness in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the reduction in risk is similar to that for non-pregnant women. Waning of vaccine effectiveness occurs more quickly after one dose of a vaccine than two doses.

N2  - Background: Aspirin at low doses has been reported to be a potential drug candidate to treat or prevent severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objectives: We aimed to explore whether low-dose aspirin used for primary cardiovascular prevention was associated with a lower risk of severe COVID-19. Method: A large cohort of patients without known cardiovascular comorbidities was constructed from the entire French population registered in national health care databases. In total, 31.1 million patients aged ≥40 years, including 1.5 million reimbursed for low-dose aspirin at least at three time points during the 6 months before the epidemic, were followed until hospitalization with a COVID-19 diagnosis or intubation/death for hospitalized patients. Results: Cox models adjusted for age and sex showed a positive association between low-dose aspirin and the risk of hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR], 1.33; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.29-1.37]) or death/intubation (HR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.33-1.47]). In fully adjusted models, associations were close to null (HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.00-1.06] and 1.04 [95% CI, 0.98-1.10], respectively). Conclusion: There was no evidence for an effect of low-dose aspirin for primary cardiovascular prevention in reducing severe COVID-19.

N2  - The COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Belgium aimed to reduce disease spread and severity. We quantified the observed vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic infection (VEi) and hospitalization (VEh). Exhaustive data on testing and vaccination was combined with a clinical hospital survey. We estimated VEi using a test negative design and VEh using a proportional hazard analysis. We controlled for prior infection, age, sex, province of residence and calendar week of sampling. Variant of concern specific VE-estimates were obtained by time since vaccination from July 2021 to April 2022. We included 1,433,135 persons. VEi against Delta waned from an initial estimate of 81% (95%CI 80-82) to 56% (95%CI 56-57) 100-150 days after primary-vaccination. Booster-vaccination increased initial VEi to 84% (95%CI 83-85). Against Omicron, an initial VEi of 37% (95%CI 34-40) waned to 18% (95%CI 17-20) 100-150 days after primary-vaccination. Booster-vaccination increased VEi to 52% (95%CI 51-53) and waned to 25% (95%CI 24-27) 100-150 days after vaccination. Hybrid immunity conferred by prior infection and booster-vaccination outperformed booster-vaccination only even if the infection was over one year ago, 67% (95%CI 66-68). Initial VEh for booster-vaccination decreased from 93% (95%CI 93-94) against Delta to 87% (95%CI 85-89) against Omicron. VEh for Omicron waned to 66% (95%CI 63-70) 100-150 days after booster-vaccination. In conclusion, we report significant immune-escape by Omicron. VEh was less affected than VEi and immune-escape was attenuated by booster-vaccination. Waning further reduced VEi- and VEh-estimates. Infection-acquired immunity offered additional protection against symptomatic infection in vaccinated persons which lasted at least one year.

N2  - Introduction: Observational studies and metanalyses have reported comparable risk to contract the SARS-CoV-2 infection between the general population and patients with IBD. However, a matter of concern remains the effectiveness of Sars-Cov2 vaccine in patients with immune mediated disease and concomitant biological and/or immunosoppressive treatments. Aims & Methods: Our aim was to evaluate the rate of new infections, symptomatic or asymptomatic, after full mRNA SARS-CoV2 vaccination, including a third dose, in a homogeneous cohort of patients with IBD followed up in a tertiary referral center from southern Italy. The relationships with disease characteristics and concomitant therapies were also assessed. Data were collected between 03/2021 and 03/2022. Most patients receveid the third dose of SARS-CoV2 vaccine between 11/2021 and 01/2022. IBD type, disease features (location, behaviour, extra intestinal manifestations), biologic therapy, immunosoppressive treatment, previous surgery, smoking habit, comorbidities and vaccination protocol were analysed. Results: Our cohort is composed of 108 patients with IBD, 52 CD and 56 UC, mean age 53,67 years, 58 pts were on biological therapy. 25/108 patients developed COVID-19 infection (23 %), 7/25 patients (28%) didn't receive the third dose because contracted the infection before the booster dose. There was a significant difference in the rate of infection between those who received the third dose and those who did not (p<0,001). The COVID-19 population was younger (48,6 ± 16,5) than the non COVID-19 population (55,2 ± 15,9, p=0,07) and female sex was more frequent (56% vs 36%, p=0,1). 19/25 (76 %) had symptomatic infection (flu-like symptoms) but none of them experienced pneumonia or severe disease. Symptomatic infection was more frequent in patients who didn't complete the vaccination protocol (68,42% VS 83,33%), though the difference was not significant. Biological therapy was not associated with the development of infection either symptomatic or asymptomatic. Smoking habit, comorbidity, type of IBD, were not significantly related to COVID-19. Conclusion: Our results confirm the effectiveness of mRNA SARS-CoV2 vaccination in patients with IBD independently from concomitant immunosuppressive therapy since only 23% of them developed the infection, most with mild symptoms. The protective effect was statistically significant in those who received the booster dose. The need of additional doses iin IBD patients on biologics will be a matter of debate.

N2  - Introduction: Since April 2021, UK guidance recommends pregnant women should be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine uptake in this population is low, though reasons for this remain poorly understood [1,2]. We aimed to characterise uptake of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients admitted to two inner-city maternity units (∼8500 deliveries per year). Methods: Caldicott Guardian approval was obtained and formal ethical review was waived. All obstetric patients admitted to Princess Royal Maternity, Glasgow, and Royal Alexandra Hospital, Paisley, between 1 May 2021 and 23 January 2022 and who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Results: There were 98 women (median [IQR] age 29.5 [26–34] years, white ethnicity 74/98 [76%], most deprived socioeconomic quintile 56/ 98 [57%]). 19/98 women (19%) had received any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine prior to infection with 9/19 receiving their first vaccine pre-pregnancy and 10/19 during pregnancy at median (IQR) 22.3 (13.8–25.0) weeks gestation. 11/98 women (11%) had received two vaccines before infection. Oxygenwas required in 32/79 (41%) of unvaccinatedwomen and 3/19 (16%) women who had received any vaccine prior to infection. No double-vaccinated women required oxygen or critical care admission. 24 women (25%) received a first vaccine after delivery and 56 women (57%) remain unvaccinated. Discussion: Vaccine uptake was poor in this inner-city cohort, with only 19% and 11% having received any or two vaccines respectively prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of those who had received any vaccine before infection, just over half received this during pregnancy. In a Scottish population study, 42.8% of all women giving birth in October 2021 had received any dose and 32.3% of women had received two doses [1]. The lower rates in our cohort may reflect our population being skewed towards more deprived groups. Our data supports the need for two vaccines for effective protection against severe COVID-19. Barriers to vaccination require urgent attention. (Figure Presented)

N2  - Introduction Data on vaccine effectiveness (VE) against Omicron in adolescents are limited. We estimated 2-dose and 3-dose VE against Omicron and Delta in adolescents aged 12-17 years in Ontario, Canada. Methods We conducted a test-negative design study among SARS-CoV-2-tested adolescents aged 12-17 years between November 22, 2021 (date of first Omicron detection) and March 6, 2022; we assessed Delta outcomes prior to January 2, 2022. We used multivariable logistic regression to compare the odds of vaccination in cases to symptomatic test-negative controls and calculated VE as 1-adjusted odds ratio. Results VE was lower against symptomatic Omicron infection than against Delta and decreased more rapidly over time, from 51% (95%CI, 38-61%) in the 7-59 days following a second dose to 29% (95%CI, 17-38%) after 180 days, compared to 97% (95%CI, 94-99%) and 90% (95%CI, 79-95%) for the same intervals against symptomatic Delta infection. Overall, 2-dose VE against severe outcomes caused by Omicron was 85% (95%CI, 74-91%) ≥7 days following a second dose and estimates were similar over time. VE against symptomatic Omicron infection was 62% (95%CI, 49-72%) ≥7 days following a third dose. Discussion Two-dose VE against symptomatic Omicron infection wanes over time in adolescents. While lower than observed against Delta, protection against severe outcomes appears to be maintained over time. A third dose substantially improves protection against Omicron infection, but 3-dose VE is only moderate at approximately 60% in the early period following vaccination and the duration of this protection is unknown.

N2  - Background: Rituximab (RTX) achieved high remission-induction and sustained maintenance rates for patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) [1], [2]. However, RTX is an expensive medication, which may potentially lead to serious side effects. Defning the best dose regimen for maintenance in AAV is still an unmet need. Objectives: The aim of the present study is to compare the effects of ultra-low dose RTX (500 mg or 1000 mg once per year) to standard low dose RTX (500 or 1000 mg twice per year) as remission-maintenance therapy in AAV patients. Methods: We included consecutive AAV patients (classifed as GPA and MPA [3]) referring to four different Rheumatology centers in Italy. We assessed all AAV patients who successfully achieved disease remission (BVASv3=0) with conventional RTX or cyclophosphamide regimens and have been subsequently treated with RTX for maintenance of remission. All included patients received at least three maintenance infusions with either 1000 mg or 500 mg, twice per year (standard low dose) or once per year (ultra-low dose). After a period of 18 months, we assessed the remission rate, damage (VDI), glucocorticoids intake, ANCA status, B-cells depletion and serum IgG levels. Results: From January 2011 to December 2021, 83 AAV patients (mean age 51±16, 49.4% female, 95.2% ANCA positive, 65.8% anti PR3, 34.2% anti MPO), 61 classifed as GPA and 22 MPA, achieved complete disease remission with conventional RTX induction regimen. After 7 [6-9] months, 29.9% patients started maintenance treatment with ultra-low dose RTX (once per year), while 70.1% patients with standard low dose (twice per year), for 18 months. No signifcant differences at baseline were noted between patients receiving ultra-low dose when compared to those treated with conventional low-dose. At the end of observation period, a disease fare was observed in 22.7% of the low-dose group, and 21.2% in those treated with the standard dose (p=0.881). Relapse-free survival was comparable between the two group (log-rank p=0.818, Figure 1). When comparing AAV patients treated with ultra-low dose regimen to those treated with low-dose, no differences were noted in negative ANCA rate (72.2% vs 67.1%, p=0.262), ANCA titer (0 [0-7.8] vs 0 [0-50] UI/mL, p=0.232), B-cells depletion rate (70.6% vs 75%, p=0.725), mean serum IgG (811 [146-922] vs 680 [429-861] mg/dL, p=0.367), mean daily glucocorticoid dosage (2.5 [0-5] vs 3.75 [0-5] mg/d, p=0.647), VDI (4 [1-5] vs 2 [1-4], p=0.098), hypogammaglobulinaemia rate (31.8% vs 36.5%, p=0.697) and deaths (4.5% vs 5.8%, p=0.831). Although not signifcant, patients treated with ultra-low dose had lower severe infection rate (10.5% vs 26.8%, p=0.154). Notably, in the all cohort 5 deaths were related to COVID19 pneumonia. Conclusion: Reduced exposure to RTX was not associated with an impaired efficacy of maintenance therapy in patients with AAV. Remission maintenance with ultra-low dose RTX is a safe and more cost-effective option.

N2  - Background. Due to severe outcomes, elderly adults 60 years or older are prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination but accumulated SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination likely modifies their risk. We estimated vaccine effectiveness against omicron-associated hospitalisation among elderly adults, by number of doses, prior infection history and time since last immunological event. Methods. We conducted a test-negative case-control study among symptomatic elderly adults tested for SARS-CoV-2 in Quebec, Canada during BA.1-, BA.2- and BA.4/5dominant periods. Relative to unvaccinated, infection-naïve participants, we compared COVID-19 hospitalisation risk by mRNA vaccine dose and/or prior infection (pre-omicron or omicron) history. Findings. During BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/5 periods, two- vs. four-dose vaccine effectiveness alone against hospitalisation was: 78% (95%CI:75-80) vs. 96% (95%CI:93-98); 60% (95%CI:50-97) vs. 84% (95%CI:81-87); and 40% (95%CI:30-49) vs. 68% (95%CI:63-72), respectively, consistent with longer median time since second vs fourth dose. By respective period, effectiveness of pre-omicron vs. omicron infection alone against hospitalisation was: 93% (95%CI:80-97) vs. [not estimable]; 88% (95%CI:50-97) vs. 96% (95%CI:68-99); and 69% (95%CI:30-85) vs. 90% (95%CI:79-95). Regardless of doses (2-5) or prior infection type, hybrid protection was ≥90%, lasting at least 6-8 months during the BA.4/5 period. Prior omicron infection alone reduced BA.4/5 hospitalisation risk by >80% for at least 6-8 months. Interpretation. Elderly adults with history of both prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and ≥2 vaccine doses appear well-protected for a prolonged period against omicron hospitalisation, including BA.4/5. Ensuring infection-naïve older adults remain up-to-date with vaccination may further reduce COVID-19 hospitalisations most efficiently. Funding.

N2  - Background. We estimated the protection against the Omicron BA.2 variant associated with prior primary infection (PI) due to pre-Omicron or Omicron BA.1 virus, with and without mRNA vaccination. Methods. A test-negative case-control study was conducted among healthcare workers (HCWs) tested for SARS-CoV-2 in Quebec, Canada, between March 27 and June 4, 2022, when BA.2 predominated and was presumptively diagnosed. Logistic regression models compared the likelihood of BA.2 reinfection (second positive test ≥30 days after PI) among HCWs with history of PI and none to three doses of mRNA vaccine versus infection-naïve, unvaccinated HCWs. Findings. Among 37,732 presumed BA.2 cases, 2,521 (6.7%) and 659 (1.7%) were reinfections following pre-Omicron or BA.1 PI, respectively. Among 73,507 controls, 7,360 (10.0%) and 12,315 (16.8%) had a pre-Omicron or BA.1 PI, respectively. Pre-Omicron PI was associated with 38% (95%CI:19-53) reduction in BA.2 infection risk, with higher BA.2 protection among those also vaccinated with one (56%), two (69%) or three (70%) vaccine doses. Omicron BA.1 PI was associated with greater protection against BA.2 (72%; 95%CI:65-78), higher among two-dose vaccinated at 96% (95%CI:95-96) but not improved with a third dose (96%; 95%CI:95-97). Hybrid Omicron BA.1 PI plus two or three dose vaccine-induced protection persisted for five months post-infection. Interpretation. Twice-vaccinated individuals who experienced BA.1 infection were subsequently well-protected for a prolonged period against BA.2 reinfection and derived no meaningful added benefit against BA.2 from a third dose of mRNA vaccine.

N2  - Importance. Omicron is phylogenetically- and antigenically-distinct from earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants and the original vaccine strain. Protection conferred by prior SARS-CoV-2 infection against Omicron re-infection, and the added value of vaccination, require quantification. Objective. To estimate protection against Omicron re-infection and hospitalization conferred by prior heterologous SARS-CoV-2 (non-Omicron) infection and/or up to three doses of (ancestral, Wuhan-like) mRNA vaccine. Design. Test-negative study between December 26 (epi-week 52), 2021 and March 12 (epi-week 10), 2022. Setting. Population-based, province of Quebec, Canada Participants. Community-dwelling ≥12-year-olds tested for SARS-CoV-2. Exposures. Prior laboratory-confirmed infection with/without mRNA vaccination. Outcomes. Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 re-infection and hospitalization, presumed Omicron by genomic surveillance. The odds of prior non-Omicron infection with/without vaccination were compared among Omicron cases/hospitalizations versus test-negative controls (single randomly-selected per individual). Adjusted odds ratios controlled for age, sex, testing-indication and epi-week. Analyses were stratified by severity and time since last non-Omicron infection or vaccine dose. Results. Without vaccination, prior non-Omicron infection reduced the Omicron re-infection risk by 44% (95%CI:38-48), decreasing from 66% (95%CI:57-73) at 3-5 months to 35% (95%CI:21-47) at 9-11 months post-infection and <30% thereafter. The more severe the prior infection, the greater the risk reduction: 8% (95%CI:17-28), 43% (95%CI:37-49) and 68% (95%CI:51-80) for prior asymptomatic, symptomatic ambulatory or hospitalized infections. mRNA vaccine effectiveness against Omicron infection was consistently significantly higher among previously-infected vs. non-infected individuals at 65% (95%CI:63-67) vs. 20% (95%CI:16-24) for one-dose; 68% (95%CI:67-70) vs. 42% (95%CI:41-44) for two doses; and 83% (95%CI:81-84) vs. 73% (95%CI:72-73) for three doses. Infection-induced protection against Omicron hospitalization was 81% (95%CI: 66-89) increasing to 86% (95%CI:77-99) with one, 94% (95%CI:91-96) with two and 97%(95%CI:94-99) with three mRNA vaccine doses. Two-dose effectiveness against hospitalization among previously-infected individuals did not wane across 11 months and did not significantly differ from three-dose effectiveness despite longer follow-up (median 158 and 27 days, respectively). Conclusions and relevance. Prior heterologous SARS-CoV-2 infection provided substantial and sustained protection against Omicron hospitalization, greatest among those also vaccinated. In the context of program goals to prevent severe outcomes and preserve healthcare system capacity, >2 doses of ancestral Wuhan-like vaccine may be of marginal incremental value to previously-infected individuals.

N2  - Background SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread despite fast vaccine rollout, which could be attributed to waning immunity or to a reduced protection against some variants. A thorough characterization of vaccine protection and its duration in time is needed to inform vaccination policies and enhance public trust. Methods We matched three national databases with exhaustive information on screening, vaccination and hospitalizations in France over the year 2021. We performed a two-step analysis to estimate vaccine effectiveness against severe forms of Covid-19 in people aged 50 years or over, combining: (i) a test-negative case-control design to assess vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infections; and (ii) a survival analysis to assess the additional protection against severe outcomes (hospitalizations and inpatient deaths) in infected individuals. Results We found a high vaccine effectiveness in people aged 50 years or more, reaching 82% against symptomatic infections and 94% against severe outcomes, after a full vaccination scheme. Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infections strongly decreased over time, dropping to 53% after six months, but remained high against severe forms (90% after six months). The booster dose allowed restoring high protection levels. Vaccine protection and its evolution in time, showed little difference against the variants that circulated prior to December 2021 in France, including the Delta variant. Conclusion Though vaccine immunity decreases over time, vaccination remains crucial to provide individual protection against severe diseases. This decline can be reversed by the injection of a booster dose.

N2  - Despite much research on the topic, little work has been done comparing the use of methods to control for confounding in the estimation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in routinely collected medical record data. We conducted a trial emulation study to replicate the ChAdOx1 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) and BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer) COVID-19 phase 3 efficacy studies. We conducted a cohort study including individuals aged 75+ from UK CPRD AURUM (N = 916,128) in early 2021. Three different methods were assessed: Overlap weighting, inverse probability treatment weighting, and propensity score matching. All three methods successfully replicated the findings from both phase 3 trials, and overlap weighting performed best in terms of confounding, systematic error, and precision. Despite lack of trial data beyond 3 weeks, we found that even 1 dose of BNT162b2 was effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection for up to 12 weeks before a second dose was administered. These results support the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation modelling and related UK vaccination strategies implemented in early 2021.

N2  - Background: By 16 January 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a total of over 1 billion confirmed cases and 2 million COVID-19 deaths globally. Several vaccines have been approved by regulators worldround, and there are twenty others more under different stages of investigation in the pipeline. Different strategies are being explored to maximise the effect of COVID-19 vaccination in Europe. Objectives: We aimed to study the impact of population prioritisation and dose intervals on infections, hospitalizations, mortality, and public health restrictions. Methods: An agent-based model was built to quantify the impact of different vaccination strategies using a 6-month horizon. Input parameters were derived from previous literature and real-world official figures from Europe. Prioritization of vulnerable vs contagious groups was explored first. Secondly, the impact of dose intervals from 3 to 12 weeks was studied. Country-specific models were built for each European country. The outcomes of interests are the total number of cases, hospitalizations, and death. Results: Prioritising vaccination of vulnerable people resulted in a similar number of cases, but clear reductions in mortality, hospital admissions, and restrictions. At a realistic vaccination speed of <=0.1% population/day, separating doses by 12 (instead of 3) weeks reduces hospitalizations, mortality and restrictions for vaccines with similar first and second dose efficacy (eg Oxford-AZ and Moderna), but not for those with reportedly lower first dose efficacy (eg Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine). Conclusions: Mass vaccination is likely to have a dramatic effect on the impact of COVID-19 on both health and the economy of Europe. Prioritizing vulnerable populations will reduce mortality, hospitalizations, and public health restrictions compared to vaccination of most contagious groups. The choice of second dose intervals should be based on the expected vaccine availability and first dose efficacy, with 12-week intervals preferred in most realistic scenarios.

N2  - There is now sufficient evidence to support that vitamin D deficiency may predispose to SARS-CoV-2 infection and increase COVID-19 severity and mortality. It has been suggested that vitamin D3 supplementation may be used prophylactically as an affordable and safe strategy that could be added to the existing COVID-19 standard treatment. This multicenter, single-blinded, prospective randomized pilot clinical trial aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of 10,000 IU/day in comparison with 2000 IU/day of cholecalciferol supplementation for 14 days to reduce the duration and severity of COVID-19 in 85 hospitalized individuals. The median age of the participants was 65 years (Interquartile range (IQR): 53–74), most of them (71%) were men and the mean baseline of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in serum was 15 ng/ml (standard deviation (SD):6). After 14 days of supplementation, serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly increased in the group who received 10,000IU/day (p < 0.0001) (n = 44) in comparison with the 2,000IU/day group (n = 41), especially in overweight and obese participants, and the higher dose was well tolerated. A fraction of the individuals in our cohort (10/85) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The median length of hospital stay in these patients with ARDS was significantly different in the participants assigned to the 10,000IU/day group (n = 4; 7 days; IQR: 4–13) and the 2,000IU/day group (n = 6; 27 days; IQR: 12–45) (p = 0.04). Moreover, the inspired oxygen fraction was reduced 7.6-fold in the high dose group (p = 0.049). In terms of blood parameters, we did not identify overall significant improvements, although the platelet count showed a modest but significant difference in those patients who were supplemented with the higher dose (p = 0.0492). In conclusion, the administration of 10,000IU/day of vitamin D3 for 14 days in association with the standard clinical care during hospitalization for COVID-19 was safe, tolerable, and beneficial, thereby helping to improve the prognosis during the recovery process.

N2  - Background: COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective for reducing severe disease and mortality. However, vaccine effectiveness data is limited from sub-Saharan Africa, where SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology has differed from other regions. We report COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against progression to in-hospital mortality in Zambia. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among admitted patients at eight COVID-19 treatment centers across Zambia during April 2021 through March 2022. Patient demographic and clinical information including vaccination status and hospitalization outcome (discharged or died) were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the odds of in-hospital mortality by vaccination status, adjusted for age, sex, number of comorbid conditions, disease severity, and COVID-19 treatment center. Vaccine effectiveness of ≥1 vaccine dose was calculated from the adjusted odds ratio. Results: Among 1,653 patients with data on their vaccination status and hospitalization outcome, 365 (22.1%) died. Overall, 236 (14.3%) patients had received ≥1 vaccine dose before hospital admission. For patients who had received ≥1 vaccine dose, 22 (9.3%) died compared with 343 (24.2%) among unvaccinated patients (p <0.01). The median time since receipt of a first vaccine dose was 52.5 days (IQR: 28-107). Vaccine effectiveness for progression to in-hospital mortality among hospitalized patients was 64.8% (95% CI: 42.3-79.4%). Conclusions: Among patients admitted to COVID-19 treatment centers in Zambia, COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower progression to in-hospital mortality. These data are consistent with evidence from other countries demonstrating benefit of COVID-19 vaccination against severe complications. Vaccination is a critical tool for reducing the consequences of COVID-19 in Zambia.

N2  - Background: Long-term effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA boosters in populations with different prior infection histories and clinical vulnerability profiles is inadequately understood. Methods: A national, matched, retrospective, target trial cohort study was conducted in Qatar to investigate effectiveness of a third mRNA (booster) dose, relative to a primary series of two doses, against SARS-CoV-2 omicron infection and against severe COVID-19. Associations were estimated using Cox proportional-hazards regression models. Results: Booster effectiveness relative to primary series was 41.1% (95% CI: 40.0-42.1%) against infection and 80.5% (95% CI: 55.7-91.4%) against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19, over one-year follow-up after the booster. Among persons clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19, effectiveness was 49.7% (95% CI: 47.8-51.6%) against infection and 84.2% (95% CI: 58.8-93.9%) against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19. Effectiveness against infection was highest at 57.1% (95% CI: 55.9-58.3%) in the first month after the booster but waned thereafter and was modest at only 14.4% (95% CI: 7.3-20.9%) by the sixth month. In the seventh month and thereafter, coincident with BA.4/BA.5 and BA.2.75* subvariant incidence, effectiveness was progressively negative reaching -20.3% (95% CI: -55.0-29.0%) after one year of follow-up. Similar levels and patterns of protection were observed irrespective of prior infection status, clinical vulnerability, or type of vaccine (BNT162b2 versus mRNA-1273). Conclusions: Boosters reduced infection and severe COVID-19, particularly among those clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19. However, protection against infection waned after the booster, and eventually suggested an imprinting effect of compromised protection relative to the primary series. However, imprinting effects are unlikely to negate the overall public health value of booster vaccinations.

N2  - Background: The BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for children 5-11 years of age and adolescents 12-17 years of age, but in different dose sizes. We assessed BNT162b2 real-world effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection among children and adolescents in Qatar. Methods: Three matched, retrospective, target-trial, cohort studies were conducted to compare incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the national cohort of vaccinated individuals to incidence in the national cohort of unvaccinated individuals. Associations were estimated using Cox proportional-hazards regression models. Results: Effectiveness of the 10 µg dose for children against Omicron infection was 25.7% (95% CI: 10.0-38.6%). It was highest at 49.6% (95% CI: 28.5-64.5%) right after the second dose, but waned rapidly thereafter and was negligible after 3 months. Effectiveness was 46.3% (95% CI: 21.5-63.3%) among those aged 5-7 years and 16.6% (-4.2-33.2%) among those aged 8-11 years. Effectiveness of the 30 µg dose for adolescents against Omicron infection was 30.6% (95% CI: 26.9-34.1%), but many adolescents were vaccinated months earlier. Effectiveness waned with time after the second dose. Effectiveness was 35.6% (95% CI: 31.2-39.6%) among those aged 12-14 years and 20.9% (13.8-27.4%) among those aged 15-17 years. Effectiveness of the 30 µg dose for adolescents against pre-Omicron infection was 87.6% (95% CI: 84.0-90.4%) and waned relatively slowly after the second dose. Conclusions: Pediatric vaccination is associated with modest and rapidly waning protection against Omicron infection. Adolescent vaccination is associated with stronger and more durable protection, perhaps because of the larger dose size. Age at such young age appears to play a role in determining vaccine protection, with greater protection observed in younger than older children or adolescents.

N2  - The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant has two subvariants, BA.1 and BA.2, that are genetically quite divergent. We conducted a matched, test-negative, case-control study to estimate duration of protection of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, after the second dose and after a third/booster dose, against BA.1 and BA.2 infections in Qatar’s population. BNT162b2 effectiveness against symptomatic BA.1 infection was highest at 46.6% (95% CI: 33.4-57.2%) in the first three months after the second dose, but then declined to ~10% or below thereafter. Effectiveness rapidly rebounded to 59.9% (95% CI: 51.2-67.0%) in the first month after the booster dose, but then started to decline again. BNT162b2 effectiveness against symptomatic BA.2 infection was highest at 51.7% (95% CI: 43.2-58.9%) in the first three months after the second dose, but then declined to ~10% or below thereafter. Effectiveness rapidly rebounded to 43.7% (95% CI: 36.5-50.0%) in the first month after the booster dose, but then declined again. Effectiveness against COVID-19 hospitalization and death was in the range of 70-80% any time after the second dose, and was greater than 90% after the booster dose. Similar patterns of protection were observed for the mRNA-1273 vaccine. mRNA vaccines provide only moderate and short-lived protection against symptomatic Omicron infections, with no discernable differences in protection against either the BA.1 or BA.2 subvariants. Vaccine protection against COVID-19 hospitalization and death is strong and durable after the second dose, but is more robust after a booster dose.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Protection conferred by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection versus COVID-19 vaccination has not been investigated in rigorously controlled studies. We compared head-to-head protection conferred by natural infection to that from the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines in Qatar, between February 28, 2020 and March 6, 2022. METHODS: Two national matched retrospective target-trial cohort studies were conducted to compare incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization and death among those with a documented primary infection to incidence among those with a two-dose primary-series vaccination. Associations were estimated using Cox proportional-hazards regression models. RESULTS: The overall adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) for infection was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.45-0.48) comparing those with a prior infection to those vaccinated with BNT162b2, and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.48-0.53) comparing those with a prior infection to those vaccinated with mRNA-1273. For BNT162b2, the AHR decreased gradually from 0.55 (95% CI: 0.46-0.65) in the fourth month after primary infection/vaccination to 0.31 (95% CI: 0.27-0.37) in the eighth month, while for mRNA-1273, it decreased from 0.80 (95% CI: 0.59-1.07) to 0.35 (95% CI: 0.29-0.41) over the same time period. During the Omicron wave, the AHR was ~0.50 for BNT162b2 and ~0.60 for mRNA-1273. The overall AHR for any severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 (against all variants) was 0.32 (95% CI: 0.10-1.00) for BNT162b2, and 0.58 (95% CI: 0.14-2.43) for mRNA-1273. CONCLUSIONS: Natural infection was associated with stronger and more durable protection against infection, regardless of the variant, than mRNA primary-series vaccination. Nonetheless, vaccination remains the safest and optimal tool of protection against infection and COVID-19 hospitalization and death.

N2  - BACKGROUND Prisons and jails are high-risk settings for Covid-19 transmission, morbidity, and mortality. We evaluate protection conferred by prior infection and vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant within the California state prison system. METHODS We employed a test-negative design to match resident and staff cases during the Omicron wave (December 24, 2021—April 14, 2022) to controls according to a case’s test-week as well as demographic, clinical, and carceral characteristics. We estimated protection against infection using conditional logistic regression, with exposure status defined by vaccination, stratified by number of mRNA doses received, and prior infection, stratified by periods before or during Delta variant predominance. RESULTS We matched 15,783 resident and 8,539 staff cases to 180,169 resident and 90,409 staff controls. Among cases, 29.7% and 2.2% were infected before or during the emergence of the Delta variant, respectively; 30.6% and 36.3% were vaccinated with two or three doses, respectively. Estimated protection from Omicron infection for two and three doses were 14.9% (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 12.3—19.7%) and 43.2% (42.2—47.4%) for those without known prior infections, 47.8% (95% CI, 46.6—52.8%) and 61.3% (95% CI, 60.7—64.8%) for those infected before the emergence of Delta, and 73.1% (95% CI, 69.8—80.1%) and 86.8% (95% CI, 82.1—92.7) for those infected during the period of Delta predominance. CONCLUSION A third mRNA dose provided significant, additional protection over two doses, including among individuals with prior infection. Our findings suggest that vaccination should remain a priority—even in settings with high levels of transmission and prior infection.

N2  - In the context of the global spread of the new coronavirus infection, studies aimed at investigating formation of anti-infectious and post-vaccination immunity are of special importance, which is necessary to prevent and reduce morbidity and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Purpose: to assess anti-infectious immunity against SARSCoV-2 in various forms of the disease and development of post-vaccination humoral reactions in medical workers of the perinatal center. Materials and methods. A study of blood serum was carried out to assess SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG antibodies in 119 medical workers recovered after COVID-19, divided into groups based on the disease severity (mild, moderate and asymptomatic), as well as in 62 vaccinated employees, divided into groups according to age. Semi-quantitative measurement of virus-specific antibodies was carried out by ELISA with test systems “SARS-CoV-2-IgG-ELISA-BEST” and “SARS-CoV-2-IgM-ELISA-BEST”. Statistical processing of the research results was carried out using Microsoft Excel 2010 and Statistica 6. Quantitative characteristics were presented as median (ME), lower and upper quartiles (LQ1-UQ3); qualitative parameters - as absolute value and relative number (%). Difference between groups was analyzed by using the χ2 test (qualitative) and the Mann-Whitney U-test (quantitative). Results. The results of the study showed that the majority of employees with a moderate-severe form of SARS-CoV-2 had a high level of IgG (PR - a positivity rate of more than 9.0 arbitrary units) 9 months after the disease compared to those who suffered from mild or asymptomatic (83.3% versus 25.8% and 13.3%, p < 0.017) infection. The duration of IgG circulation after former illness had no relation to its severity and patient age. The effectiveness of the primary vaccination “Sputnik V” and revaccination with “Sputnik Light” and “KoviVak” was 100% after inoculating the vaccine second component. The lowest level of antibodies after the first vaccination is recorded in persons over 60 years old (1.48 (1.12-3.25 versus PR = 8.48 (5.78-10.11) and 9.27 (5.84-10.31) arbitrary units, p < 0.017)), in comparison with young and middle-age subjects. The speed SARS-CoV-2 elimination of IgG at 6, 9 or more months after vaccination depends on relevant initial peak antibody concentration. Subjects who were initially vaccinated with the KoviVac vaccine, IgG was not detected 2 months after vaccination. The protective effect of “Sputnik V”, “Sputnik Light”, “KoviVac” after re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 averages 71.2%. Conclusion. Thus, the results obtained on assessing anti-infectious and post-vaccination immunity against SARS-CoV-2 emphasize the need for further studies on a larger patient cohort, especially in those with asymptomatic infection as well as the elderly subjects.

N2  - Introduction/Background: COVID-19 disease, caused by SARSCoV- 2 virus, first emerged as a presentation of severe respiratory disease in 2019. Although children exhibit mild disease, concerns were raised about serious infection in immunocompromised children. The current national guidance recommends that immunocompromised children between 12 and 18 years of age should be offered three primary doses of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, 8 weeks apart, followed by a booster dose within 3 months. This audit looked at the awareness and uptake of this regime in young persons on immunosuppression. This information was disseminated to families during clinical contacts and automatic replies sent out fromthe team mailbox. Description/Method: To collect the data for the audit, we used an anonymous questionnaire to capture the following information: • Diagnosis • Immunomodulatory/Immunosuppressive treatment • Their awareness of the regime for COVID vaccine (number of doses and interval) • Number of vaccines taken • If not taken, why? The questionnaires were handed out to 31 patients attending Paediatric Rheumatology day-care and outpatient clinics over a twoweek period for their response. There were no non-responders. Patients who were not on any immunosuppressant medication were excluded. The split of their diagnoses and medications are summarised in tables 1 and 2: Patients with JIA (55%) unsurprisingly dominated the cohort, followed by JSLE, JDM and scleroderma. Only 3/31 patients (10%) were on any form of systemic steroid therapy (all on oral Prednisolone less than 0.5 mg/kg). Majority of the patients (21/31 - 68%) were on Methotrexate, either on its own, or in combination with one of the biologic agents (one scleroderma patient was on MTX + MMF). 14/21 (45%) patients were on one of the biologic agents, of which only one patient was on Rituximab. Discussion/Results: The results showed that only 6/31 (19%) of patients/their carers knew the correct number (3+1) of COVID vaccines recommended in this cohort. 18/31 (58%) patients had received the vaccine, of which 4 patients refused further doses due to side effects they had experienced following the first dose. Of the 13 young people who did not take the vaccine, 9 patients (29%) were unsure whether they need the vaccine. They did not know the benefits of the vaccine and were afraid it either could have a negative effect on immunocompromised children or just were not aware of the guidelines. The other 4 (13%) participants did not want to take the vaccine due to their own personal beliefs. Although concerns were raised about serious COVID-19 infection in immunocompromised children, there is currently very little evidence to suggest that the infection rate and severity of COVID-19 infection in children treated with Methotrexate or biologic agents is higher or the treatment needs to be discontinued or the doses adjusted. There is some emerging evidence to suggest that adults on Rituximab and to a lesser extend Mycophenolate may have increased risk of developing severe outcomes from COVID-19, which has not been replicated in children. The recommendation for third primary dose is based on preliminary results from UK studies of real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE) in persons who are immunosuppressed, suggesting a modest reduction in VE against symptomatic COVID-19. There is also emerging evidence that COVID vaccination significantly reduces the risk of Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome (PIMS-TS) in 12 - 18 year olds. Key learning points/Conclusion: Despite the notion that the team had disseminated information on the vaccine regime to patients, only one fifth of the patients/carers knew the exact regime for COVID vaccine recommended in this group of young people. Just under 60% of the patients took the vaccine, with the rest choosing not to have it due to a mixture of lack of information and personal choice. The action plan was drawn up to: 1. enquire about and document vaccination status, and provide advice and information during every clinical contact; 2. include COVID vaccine in education sessions by nursing team; 3. include the information as default in all clinic letters; 4. reaudit in six months.

N2  - Individuals in contact with persons with COVID-19 are at high risk of developing COVID-19, but protection offered by COVID-19 vaccines in the context of known exposure is unknown. Symptomatic outpatients reporting acute onset of COVID-19-like illness and tested for SARSCoV-2 infection were enrolled. Among 2,229 participants, 283/451 (63%) of those reporting contact and 331/1778 (19%) without known contact tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. Using the test-negative design, adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 71% (95% confidence interval, 49%-83%) among fully vaccinated participants reporting contact versus 80% (95% CI, 72%-86%) among those without. This study supports COVID-19 vaccination and highlights the importance of efforts to increase vaccination coverage.

N2  - Importance: Recommendations for additional doses of COVID vaccine are restricted to people with HIV who have advanced disease or unsuppressed HIV viral load. Understanding SARSCoV-2 infection risk post-vaccination among PWH is essential for informing vaccination guidelines. Objective: Estimate the risk of breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated people with (PWH) and without (PWoH) HIV in the US. Design, setting, and participants: The Corona-Infectious-Virus Epidemiology Team (CIVET)-II cohort collaboration consists of 4 longitudinal cohorts from integrated health systems and academic health centers. Each cohort identified individuals ≥18 years old, in-care, and fully vaccinated for COVID-19 through 30 June 2021. PWH were matched to PWoH on date fully vaccinated, age group, race/ethnicity, and sex at birth. Incidence rates per 1,000 person-years and cumulative incidence of breakthrough infections with 95% confidence intervals ([,]) were estimated by HIV status. Cox proportional hazards models estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of breakthrough infections by HIV status adjusting for demographic factors, prior COVID-19 illness, vaccine type (BNT162b2, [Pfizer], mRNA-1273 [Moderna], Jansen Ad26.COV2.S [J&J]), calendar time, and cohort. Risk factors for breakthroughs among PWH, were also investigated. Exposure: HIV infection Outcome: COVID-19 breakthrough infections, defined as laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 diagnosis after an individual was fully vaccinated. Results: Among 109,599 individuals (31,840 PWH and 77,759 PWoH), the rate of breakthrough infections was higher in PWH versus PWoH: 44 [41, 48] vs. 31 [29, 33] per 1,000 person-years. Cumulative incidence at 210 days after date fully vaccinated was low, albeit higher in PWH versus PWoH overall (2.8% versus 2.1%, log-rank p<0.001, risk difference=0.7% [0.4%, 1.0%]) and within each vaccine type. Breakthrough infection risk was 41% higher in PWH versus PWoH (aHR=1.41 [1.28, 1.56]). Among PWH, younger age (18-24 versus 45-54), history of COVID-19 prior to fully vaccinated date, and J&J vaccination (versus Pfizer) were associated with increased risk of breakthroughs. There was no association of breakthrough with HIV viral load suppression or CD4 count among PWH. Conclusions and Relevance: COVID-19 vaccination is effective against infection with SARSCoV-2 strains circulating through 30 Sept 2021. PWH have an increased risk of breakthrough infections compared to PWoH. Recommendations for additional vaccine doses should be expanded to all PWH.

N2  - The vaccination campaign for the Veneto region (northeastern Italy) started on 27 December 2020. As of early December 2021, 75.1% of the whole Veneto population has been fully vaccinated. Vaccine efficacy has been demonstrated in many clinical trials, but reports on real-world contexts are still necessary. We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 2,233,399 residents in the Veneto region to assess the reduction in the COVID-19 burden, taking different outcomes into consideration. First, we adopted a non-brand-specific approach borrowed from survival analysis to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in preventing infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. We used t-tests and multivariate regressions to examine vaccine impact on breakthrough infections, in terms of the persistence of positivity and the length of hospital stays. Evidence emerging from this study suggests that unvaccinated individuals are significantly more likely to become infected, need hospitalization, and are at a higher risk of death from COVID-19 than those given at least one dose of vaccine. Cox models indicate that the effectiveness of full vaccination is 88% against infection, 94% against hospitalization, and 95% against death. Multivariate regressions suggest that vaccination is significantly correlated with a shorter period of positivity and shorter hospital stays, with each step toward completion of the vaccination cycle coinciding with a reduction of 3.3 days in the persistence of positivity and 2.3 days in the length of hospital stay.

N2  - During December 2021 the fifth COVID-19 wave started in Israel, caused mostly by the Omicron variant, affecting the unvaccinated and vaccinated population. Ninety percent of the Israeli adults, including most healthcare workers (HCWs), received three doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine until September 2021. Following the success and safety of the 3rd dose in preventing infection and severe disease, on December 30, 2021, the Israeli Ministry of Health recommended a voluntary 4th vaccine dose to adults above 60 years, immunocompromised, and HCWs. We compared breakthrough infections in HCWs, between 3 and 4-dose recipients. Hospitals collected data on personnel vaccinations and infections dates. The study cohort included all HCWs in eleven hospitals in Israel, who have been vaccinated with three doses up to September 30, 2021, and had not contracted COVID-19 before the vaccination campaign (January 2, 2022). We calculated breakthrough infection rates in 4-dose recipients (more than six days after vaccination) vs. 3-dose recipients. Rate-ratios were calculated for the entire cohort and for subgroups (hospital, sex, age-groups, and profession). Additionally, we repeated the calculations on 4-dose and 3-dose recipients who received the 3rd dose on the same date and were matched for sex, age group, profession and hospital. We generated time-dependent Cox-regression models to account for 4th dose administration timing (Supplement). There were 29,612 HCWs who received 3 vaccine doses between August and September 2021; of these, 5,331 (18.0%) received the 4th dose during January 2022 and were not infected by the first week after vaccination. Overall breakthrough infection rates in the 4-dose and 3-dose groups were 368/5331 (6.9%) and 4802/24280 (19.8%), respectively. The RR (95%CI) was 0.35 (0.32 to 0.39) for crude analysis, and 0.61 (0.54 to 0.71) in the matched analysis. The adjusted HR in the Cox-regression model was 0.56 (0.50 to 0.63). In both groups, severe disease and death were not reported. Our data shows that the 4th BNT162b2 dose resulted in reduced breakthrough infection rates among HCWs. This reduction, similar to the findings in the Israeli elderly population, is lower than that observed after the 3rd dose. Nevertheless, considering the high infectivity of the Omicron variant, which led to critical medical staff shortages, a 4th vaccine dose should be considered to mitigate the infection rate among HCWs.

N2  - Introduction: Registration studies have shown high efficacy of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. We evaluated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in a cohort of healthcare workers (HCWs) of a large hospital in Milan, Lombardy, Italy. Material and Methods: Follow-up started on 27 December 2020 (beginning of the vaccination campaign). HCWs without history of SARS-CoV-2 infection before the start date and with at least a nasopharyngeal test afterwards were included. Vaccination was treated as a time-dependent variable. For selected periods after vaccination we calculated incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of infection with a Poisson regression model adjusted for gender, age, occupation, and 30-day periods, and then VE as (1 – IRR)x100 using unvaccinated person-time as reference. Databases were closed on 27 September 2021. The study was approved by the hospital’s ethics committee (Milano Area 2, Prot. No. 828_2021bis). Results and Conclusions: We included 3,809 HCWs, 131 still unvaccinated and 3,678 vaccinated (3,576 with two doses). We identified 134 infections (62% symptomatic). Adjusted VE was 77% (CI: 43-91) from day 14 after the first vaccine dose and 87% (CI: 79-92) at least 7 days after the second dose. After full vaccination schedule VE was 89% (CI: 82-94) for symptomatic and 77% (CI: 45-90) for asymptomatic infections. In conclusion, we found high effectiveness of BNT162b2 vaccine in reducing incidence of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. The follow-up is continuing to assess long-term effectiveness, also considering emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

N2  - Introduction Randomized controlled trials showed efficacy of vaccines against coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). There is the need to quantify vaccine effectiveness in real-word contexts, including people at high risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), such as health care workers (HCWs). Objectives To evaluate vaccine effectiveness among hospital HCWs. Methods We performed a cohort study among HCWs of a large University hospital in Milan, Lombardy, Italy by merging routinely collected data on demographics, COVID-19 vaccination, and polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) tests performed on nasopharyngeal swabs. Follow-up started on December 27, 2020 (start of vaccination campaign). We included HCWs never PCR-positive before the start date and with at least a PCR test afterwards. Vaccination was treated as a time-dependent variable by calculating person-years (PY) at risk before and after vaccine doses. Subjects contributed PY until first positive PCR test (cases) or last test for never positive HCWs (to avoid immortal time bias). We calculated infection rates (cases per 1000 PY), rate ratios (RR, with a Poisson regression model adjusted for gender, age, occupation and 30-day periods), vaccine effectiveness (VE = (1-RR)x100) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) taking never vaccinated HCWs as reference. Results As of May 10, there were 3,152 vaccinated (97% with BNT162b2, 140 with one dose, 2,679 with two doses) and 333 non-vaccinated. We counted 29 infected cases (rate 385) among non-vaccinated, 6 (rate 65) from day 14 after the first dose (VE 79%, CI 49-92%), and 24 (rate 65) from day 7 after the second dose (VE 89%, CI 80-94%). Most cases after vaccination were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Conclusion In these preliminary analysis we found high effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine in HCWs in our hospital. Further work is needed to assess long-term effectiveness and to better plan future preventive strategies among this high-risk occupational group.

N2  - Introduction: Vodobatinib is a novel third generation TKI effective against wild-type and mutated BCR-ABL1 (except T315I) with limited off-target activity. We present updated results from the Phase 1 dose-escalation (DEs) and expansion (DEx) study in CML and Ph+ALL patients (pts) failing ≥ 3 prior TKIs (< 3 prior TKIs if approved TKI is not clinically advised or available); patients with T315I are not eligible (NCT02629692). Methods: This is an open-label, phase 1, multicentre, 3+3 study evaluating maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety and efficacy of vodobatinib administered once daily in 28 day cycles (dose range: 12 to 240 mg). MTD was established at 204 mg. DEx study enrolled chronic phase CML (CP-CML) patients at 174 mg dose of vodobatinib. Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, consent withdrawal or death. Adverse events were assessed using NCI-CTCAE v4.03. Results: As of 15 Jul 2021, 52 pts are enrolled in DEs and DEx cohorts. Forty one of these pts received doses from 12 to 240 mg in the DEs cohort;32 chronic phase (CP-CML), 3 accelerated phase CML (AP-CML), 4 blast phase CML (BP-CML), 2 Ph+ ALL. Eleven CPCML pts were enrolled in DEx cohort at 174 mg dose. The baseline demographics and disease history are represented in Table 1. Efficacy: Of the 32 CP-CML pts enrolled in DEs: At baseline, 21 (65%) pts had no cytogenetic response, 4 (12.5%) were in PCyR, 7 (22%) were in CCyR. On vodobatinib therapy, 11(34%) pts achieved CCyR, 3 (9%) achieved PCyR and 7 (22%) maintained baseline CCyR. Baseline major molecular response (MMR) was present in 1 (3%) pt; and 14 pts (44%) achieved MMR on study. Of the remaining 11 pts, 5 (16%) had haematologically stable disease (no CyR and molecular response) and 6 (19%) had disease progression (cytogenetic or hematological) as their best response (Table 2 and 3). Seventeen CP-CML pts had prior ponatinib treatment, of which 11 (65%) had MCyR (4 achieved CCyR, 4 maintained CCyR, 3 achieved PCyR); while 8 (47%) achieved MMR. In the remaining 15 pts ponatinib naïve CP-CML: 10 (66%) had CCyR (7 achieved CCyR, 3 maintained CCyR); with 7 (47%) with MMR (6 achieved, 1 maintained). Two of the 3, AP-CML pts had baseline hematological response (CHR) with absence of cytogenetic and molecular response. The 3 pts further deepened their responses with 1 pt achieving CCyR with MMR and 2 pts in PCyR. Of the 4 BP-CML pts, 2 achieved CHR and 2 patients had disease progression as their best response; Of the 2 Ph+ ALL pts, 1 pt maintained CCyR and MMR while the other reported disease progression as the best response. Median duration of treatment overall was 23 (0.5-51) months [CP-CML 23 (0.5-51); AP-CML 36 (9-40); BP-CML 3 (0.5-18) and Ph+ ALL 4 (0.7-7.3) months]. Twenty one pts continue in study. In the DEx cohort, 1 of the 11 CP-CML pts was in PCyR at baseline. No pts had molecular response. Of the 11 patients, 6 (54 %) pts achieved CCyR, 1(10%) pt achieved PCyR. MMR was achieved by 1 pt (10%). Data is maturing for 1 pt. Median duration of treatment is 16 (0.3-19) months and 10 pts continue in study. Safety: Forty nine of 52 pts reported at least 1 TEAE. Most common any grade TEAEs included thrombocytopenia (33%), cough (19%), anaemia & diarrhoea (17% each). Thirty one pts (60%) reported Grade 3 and 4 treatment emergent AEs: most common were thrombocytopenia (15%), neutropenia and anaemia (12%), increased amylase and lipase (8% each). Ten (19%) pts reported cardiovascular TEAEs (Grade 1: angina pectoris, palpitations, ventricular extra-systoles, arteriosclerosis, hot flush, hypotension, intermittent claudication; Grade 2: hypertension, hypotension; Grade 3: cardiac failure congestive, hypertension); with a Grade 2 hypertension being vodobatinib related. Nineteen pts (37%) reported SAEs; vodobatinib related SAEs were reported in 3 pts (fatal intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), Grade 2 back pain and Grade 3 amnesia reported in 1 pt each). There were 5 deaths on study: 1 was related to use of vodobatinib (1 ICH, confounded by disease progression to blast phase that included extra-medullary sites) and the remaining unrelated (1 sudden death, 1 disease progression, 1 pneumonia fungal, 1 suspected COVID-19). Conclusion: Vodobatinib continues to be associated with favourable long term safety and efficacy in heavily pre-treated CML failing ≥ 3 prior TKIs, including ponatinib. Phase 2 study evaluating vodobatinib in pts failing at least 3 prior lines of therapy, including ponatinib, is ongoing.

N2  - Introduction: Vodobatinib is a novel third generation TKI effective against wild-type and mutated BCR-ABL1 (except T315I) with limited off-target activity. We present updated results from the Phase 1 dose-escalation (DEs) and expansion (DEx) study in CML and Ph+ALL patients (pts) failing ≥ 3 prior TKIs (< 3 prior TKIs if approved TKI is not clinically advised or available); patients with T315I are not eligible (NCT02629692). Methods: This is an open-label, phase 1, multicentre, 3+3 study evaluating maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety and efficacy of vodobatinib administered once daily in 28 day cycles (dose range: 12 to 240 mg). MTD was established at 204 mg. DEx study enrolled chronic phase CML (CP-CML) patients at 174 mg dose of vodobatinib. Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, consent withdrawal or death. Adverse events were assessed using NCI-CTCAE v4.03. Results: As of 15 Jul 2021, 52 pts are enrolled in DEs and DEx cohorts. Forty one of these pts received doses from 12 to 240 mg in the DEs cohort;32 chronic phase (CP-CML), 3 accelerated phase CML (AP-CML), 4 blast phase CML (BP-CML), 2 Ph+ ALL. Eleven CP-CML pts were enrolled in DEx cohort at 174 mg dose. The baseline demographics and disease history are represented in Table 1. Efficacy: Of the 32 CP-CML pts enrolled in DEs: At baseline, 21 (65%) pts had no cytogenetic response, 4 (12.5%) were in PCyR, 7 (22%) were in CCyR. On vodobatinib therapy, 11(34%) pts achieved CCyR, 3 (9%) achieved PCyR and 7 (22%) maintained baseline CCyR. Baseline major molecular response (MMR) was present in 1 (3%) pt; and 14 pts (44%) achieved MMR on study. Of the remaining 11 pts, 5 (16%) had haematologically stable disease (no CyR and molecular response) and 6 (19%) had disease progression (cytogenetic or hematological) as their best response (Table 2 and 3). Seventeen CP-CML pts had prior ponatinib treatment, of which 11 (65%) had MCyR (4 achieved CCyR, 4 maintained CCyR, 3 achieved PCyR); while 8 (47%) achieved MMR. In the remaining 15 pts ponatinib naïve CP-CML: 10 (66%) had CCyR (7 achieved CCyR, 3 maintained CCyR); with 7 (47%) with MMR (6 achieved, 1 maintained). Two of the 3, AP-CML pts had baseline hematological response (CHR) with absence of cytogenetic and molecular response. The 3 pts further deepened their responses with 1 pt achieving CCyR with MMR and 2 pts in PCyR. Of the 4 BP-CML pts, 2 achieved CHR and 2 patients had disease progression as their best response; Of the 2 Ph+ ALL pts, 1 pt maintained CCyR and MMR while the other reported disease progression as the best response. Median duration of treatment overall was 23 (0.5-51) months [CP-CML 23 (0.5-51); AP-CML 36 (9-40); BP-CML 3 (0.5-18) and Ph+ ALL 4 (0.7-7.3) months]. Twenty one pts continue in study. In the DEx cohort, 1 of the 11 CP-CML pts was in PCyR at baseline. No pts had molecular response. Of the 11 patients, 6 (54 %) pts achieved CCyR, 1(10%) pt achieved PCyR. MMR was achieved by 1 pt (10%). Data is maturing for 1 pt. Median duration of treatment is 16 (0.3-19) months and 10 pts continue in study. Safety: Forty nine of 52 pts reported at least 1 TEAE. Most common any grade TEAEs included thrombocytopenia (33%), cough (19%), anaemia & diarrhoea (17% each). Thirty one pts (60%) reported Grade 3 and 4 treatment emergent AEs: most common were thrombocytopenia (15%), neutropenia and anaemia (12%), increased amylase and lipase (8% each). Ten (19%) pts reported cardiovascular TEAEs (Grade 1: angina pectoris, palpitations, ventricular extra-systoles, arteriosclerosis, hot flush, hypotension, intermittent claudication; Grade 2: hypertension, hypotension; Grade 3: cardiac failure congestive, hypertension); with a Grade 2 hypertension being vodobatinib related. Nineteen pts (37%) reported SAEs; vodobatinib related SAEs were reported in 3 pts (fatal intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), Grade 2 back pain and Grade 3 amnesia reported in 1 pt each). There were 5 deaths on study: 1 was related to use of vodobatinib (1 ICH, confounded by disease progression to blast phase that included extra- medullary sites) and the remaining unrelated (1 sudden death, 1 disease progression, 1 pneumonia fungal, 1 suspected COVID-19). Conclusion: Vodobatinib continues to be associated with favourable long term safety and efficacy in heavily pre-treated CML failing ≥ 3 prior TKIs, including ponatinib. Phase 2 study evaluating vodobatinib in pts failing at least 3 prior lines of therapy, including ponatinib, is ongoing.

N2  - Background: Severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infections are associated with high rates of thromboembolic complications. Professional societies and expert consensus reports have recommended anticoagulants for COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Our study aimed to compare the effect of therapeutic, intermediate and prophylactic doses of heparin on 6-week survival in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Methods. The study sample is a French cohort of COVID-19 patients hospitalized between Feb 25th and Apr 30th 2020. Patients were assigned to one of 3 anticoagulation dose groups based on the maximum dose they received for at least three days (prophylactic, intermediate or therapeutic). The main outcome was survival up to 42 days after hospital admission. Multivariate Cox regression models were performed to adjust analyses for confounding factors. Results. A total of 323 patients were included. The mean age of the study sample was 71.6 ± 15 years, and 56.3% were men. Treatment with the intermediate versus prophylactic dose of anticoagulation (HR = 0.50, 95%CI = [0.26; 0.99], p = 0.047) and with therapeutic versus prophylactic dose (HR = 0.58 95%CI = [0.34; 0.98], p = 0.044) was associated with a significant reduction in 6-week mortality, after adjustment for potential confounding factors. Comparison of therapeutic versus intermediate doses showed no significant difference in survival. Conclusions. Our results reported a significant positive effect of intermediate and therapeutic doses of heparin on 6-week survival for hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared with a prophylactic dose.

N2  - Background and aims: The World Health Organization (WHO) goal of hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination by 2030 relies on the scaling-up of policies of both identification and treatment of the infected population, worldwide. In Italy, it has been estimated that at least 200, 000 people are unaware of their HCV infection thus reinforcing the need for broadening population access to effective screening programs. Method: A pivotal screening program targeting subjects born between 1969 and 1989 has been conducted in Lombardy, Northern Italy, where point-of-care (POC) testing was offered for free concomitantly to COVID-19 vaccination. Result: Overall, 7, 219 subjects underwent HCV screening in 4 vaccination hubs. Characteristics of the screened cohort and pivotal strategies are reported in Table. Seven (0.1%) subjects tested anti-HCV positive and 5 (0.07%) were HCV-RNA positive by standard confirmation tests. Patients with HCV infection were all males, aged 41–46 years; only one of them came from Italy. Clinical data were available for 3 patients: all of them have altered transaminases, without HBV or HIV co-infection; HCV genotypes were 1b, 3 and 4, and liver stiffness ranged between 4.5 and 10.3 kPa. All patients underwent DAA therapies. Table: Pivotal screening strategies according to each participating Center (Table Presented) Results are reported as number (n) and percentages (%) or median (range). HCV: Hepatitis C Virus; POC: Point-of-Care; NA: Not Available §refers only to screening days, in each vaccination hub; *all from patients’ alliance Conclusion: This pivotal study demonstrated the feasibility of a POCbased anti-HCV screening program in young adults undergoing COVID-19 vaccination. The prevalence of HCV infection in subjects born in the 1969–1989 cohort in Italy seems to be lower than previously estimated, thus raising the question whether more HCV carriers can be identified if screening is moved up to embrace subjects born before 1969.

N2  - Background and Aim: The World Health Organization (WHO) goal of hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination by 2030 relies on the scaling-up of policies of both identification and linkage-to-care of the infected population, worldwide. In Italy, the estimated burden of HCV carriers who are unaware of their infection amounts to 200,000 persons, thus reinforcing the need for broadening population access to effective screening programs. Methods: A pivotal screening program targeting subjects born between 1969 and 1989 has been conducted in Lombardy, where point-of-care (POC) testing was offered for free concomitantly to COVID-19 vaccination. Results: Overall, 7,219 subjects underwent HCV screening in 4 vaccination hubs. Pivotal strategies varied according to each vaccination hub: each screening team has employed from 2-3 to 9-12 people daily, and took 16-128 hours to complete the screening program. Seven (0.1%) subjects tested anti-HCV positive and 5 (0.07%) had confirmed anti-HCV and HCV-RNA positivity by standard confirmation tests. Patients with HCV infection were all males, aged 41-46 years; only one of them came from Italy. Clinical data were available for 3 patients: all of them have altered transaminases values, without HBV or HIV co-infection; HCV genotypes were 1b, 3 and 4, and liver stiffness ranged between 4.5 and 10.3 kPa. All patients underwent oral anti-HCV therapies. The overall mean cost per test (including confirmation tests) was 9.8 €, of which 68.3% related to human resources (36.0% for clinicians, 21.8% for nurses, 10.5% for research assistants). Conclusions: This pivotal study demonstrated the feasibility of a POC-based anti-HCV screening program in young adults undergoing COVID-19 vaccination. The prevalence of HCV infection in subjects born in the 1969-1989 cohort in Italy seems to be lower than previously estimated, thus raising the question whether more HCV carriers can be identified if screening is moved up to embrace subjects born before 1969.

N2  - Background: Health care workers (HCWs) are at high risk of contracting an infection by SARS CoV-2 and thus they are a priority for vaccination. We hereby aim to investigate whether the risk of severe and moderate systemic symptoms (MSS) after vaccination is higher in HCWs with a history of previous COVID-19. Methods: An online questionnaire was offered to the cohort all HCWs undergoing anti-SARS CoV-2 mRNA BNT162b2 vaccination between January 4th and February 9th 2021 in two large tertiary hospitals (ASST Santi Paolo and Carlo) in Milan, Italy. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 was recorded. Local and systemic symptoms after each of the two doses were reported. MSS were those either interfering with daily activities or resulting in time off-work. Factors associated to MSS were identified by logistic regression. Findings: 3,078 HCW were included. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 occurred in 396 subjects (12·9%). 59·6% suffered from ≥1 local or systemic symptom after the first and 73·4% after the second dose. MSS occurred in 6·3% of cases (14·4% with previous vs 5·1% with no COVID-19 p<0·001) and in 28·3% (24·5% in COVID-19 vs 28·3% no COVID, p = 0·074) after the first and second dose, respectively. Subjects already experiencing COVID-19 had an independent 3-fold higher risk of MSS after the first and a 30% lower risk after the second dose. No severe adverse events were reported. Interpretation: Our data confirm in a real-world setting, the lack of severe adverse events and the short duration of reactogenicity in already infected HCWs. Possible differences in immune reactivity are drivers of MSS among this group of HCWs, as well as among females and younger individuals. Funding: None.

N2  - Background: Several different types of vaccines have been developed for the prevention of coronavirus disease (COVID‐19). Despite several local and systemic side‐effects to COVID‐19 vaccination reported, the vaccines are still considered the best intervention to tackle the spread of the virus and reduce the severity of COVID‐19 infection. However, the reported side‐effects continue to have a crucial role in public confidence in the vaccine and its acceptance. This study aimed to investigate the short‐term side‐effects reported by the healthcare workers (HCWs) in Saudi Arabia after receiving the first dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV‐19) COVID‐19 vaccine. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted among HCWs in the Jazan region of southwestern Saudi Arabia. Healthcare workers who had received the first dose of the COVID‐19 vaccine and agreed to participate in the study were followed up for 3 weeks post vaccination through a weekly online survey. Information was collected on local and/or systemic side‐effects reported following vaccine administration. Participants’ general and demographic information was also collected. Results: A total of 57.2% (250/437) of the HCWs who participated in this study reported at least one side‐effect. Injection site pain and redness (80.0%), fever (73.2%), whole‐body pain/fatigue (56.4%), and headache (48.8%) were the most commonly reported side‐effects. Moreover, 12.4% of the participants who reported side‐effects needed to see a physician, and only one female participant was admitted to the hospital. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that nationality (Saudi, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.65; 95% CI = 2.40, 5.55) and residency (Jazan governorate, aOR = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.15, 0.95) were the significant factors associated with reporting COVID‐19 post‐vaccination side‐effects, while the number of reported side‐effects was found to be significantly influenced by occupation (medical, aOR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.26, 0.66; p < 0.001) and gender (female, aOR = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.38, 0.97; p = 0.038). Conclusions: Findings of the present study support the safety of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID‐19 vaccine among HCWs in Saudi Arabia. All the reported side‐effects were mild‐to‐moderate side‐effects. The findings may help convince vaccine‐hesitant individuals and skeptics to accept the COVID‐19 vaccine.

N2  - Background: Although there is extensive literature on the clinical benefits of COVID-19 vaccination, data on humanistic effects are limited. This study evaluated the impact of SARSCoV-2 infection on symptoms, Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and Work Productivity and Impairment (WPAI) prior to and one month following infection, and compared results between individuals vaccinated with BNT162b2 and those unvaccinated. Methods: Subjects with ≥1 self-reported symptom and positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 at CVS Health US test sites were recruited between 01/31/2022-04/30/2022. Socio-demographics, clinical characteristics and vaccination status were evaluated. Self-reported symptoms, HRQoL, and WPAI outcomes were assessed using questionnaires and validated instruments (EQ-5D-5L, WPAI-GH) across acute COVID time points from pre-COVID to Week 4, and between vaccination groups. Mixed models for repeated measures were conducted for multivariable analyses, adjusting for several covariates. Effect size (ES) of Cohen's d was calculated to quantify the magnitude of outcome changes within and between vaccination groups. Results: The study population included 430 subjects: 197 unvaccinated and 233 vaccinated with BNT162b2. Mean (SD) age was 42.4 years (14.3), 76.0% were female, 38.8% reported prior infection and 24.2% at least one comorbidity. Statistically significant differences in outcomes were observed compared with baseline and between groups. The EQ-Visual analogue scale scores and Utility Index dropped in both cohorts at Day 3 and increased by Week 4, but did not return to pre-COVID levels. The mean changes were statistically lower in the BNT162b2 cohort at Day 3 and Week 4. The BNT162b2 cohort reported lower prevalence and fewer symptoms at index date and Week 4. At Week 1, COVID-19 had a large impact on all WPAI-GH domains: the work productivity time loss among unvaccinated and vaccinated was 65.0% and 53.8%, and the mean activity impairment was 50.2% and 43.9%, respectively. With the exception of absenteeism at Week 4, the BNT162b2 cohort was associated with statistically significant less worsening in all WPAI-GH scores at both Week 1 and 4. Conclusions: COVID-19 negatively impacted HRQoL and work productivity among mildly symptomatic outpatients. Compared with unvaccinated, those vaccinated with BNT162b2 were less impacted by COVID-19 infection and recovered faster.

N2  - RATIONALE: Many individuals are now permitted to receive the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the effectiveness of preventing hospitalization among patients over the age of 65 receiving the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines was 96%. We hypothesized that life-saving pop-up COVID-19 vaccine centers would be cost-effective to the healthcare system and contribute positively to our community's health. METHODS: We calculated the cost required to operate a vaccine center, the cost to receive the vaccine, and the costs that may accumulate due to infection. By obtaining data from our center, a local emergency medical services agency, and a hospital in our county, we modeled the expenses that may be avoided by receiving the vaccine. We analyzed the expenditures of 123 inpatient cases and 181 emergency room diagnoses. We created a model to visualize different outcomes along with their associated costs. We calculated the average reimbursement a community COVID-19 vaccine center receives for administering one dose of the vaccine and the number needed to treat to recover infrastructure costs. RESULTS: The average costs of a COVID-19 diagnosis in the critical decision unit and emergency rooms were $1,274 and $635, respectively. For a cohort of 181 patients, the combined cost per COVID-19 diagnosis was $1,193. The average cost for 123 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit who received various interventions was $23,385. We incurred a fixed price of $23,873 to open a pop-up vaccination center and a dynamic amount of $10,823 to operate this center for 6 months. On average, reimbursement after insurance-based contractual adjustment was $20 for each vaccine administered. CONCLUSION: The costbenefit analysis suggests for a vaccine center to be financially efficient, we must vaccinate 1,710 patients to avert a financial deficit. By vaccinating one individual we contribute to the community's health and potentially prevent $1,100 - $24,000 in medical expenses, and further infection of others. Interpreting the model we created, we visualize that receiving the vaccine, which is free, can help to prevent many different medical complications that may arise when infected with COVID-19, along with the expenses that are associated when visiting an emergency room. Preventing illness or potential fatality in even one life is immeasurable and outweighs any cost considerations our study revealed.

N2  - Background/Purpose: We assess the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing SARS-CoV2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalizations in patients with psoriatic disease (PsD) and non-psoriatic controls, and the association of immune-modulating medications on these COVID-19-related outcomes. Methods: A population-based study was performed using the data from the Clalit Health Services in Israel. We assembled a cohort of patients with diagnoses of psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis (collectively termed PsD) and matched them by age, sex, and clinic (1:5 ratio) with non-psoriatic controls. For assessment of vaccine effectiveness, the following 2 periods were analyzed separately: Period 1 which corresponds to initiation of COVID-19 vaccinations until initiation of booster vaccines (December 2020-August 2021); Period 2 corresponds to initiation of booster vaccines to end of study (August 2021-December 2021). Study outcomes included: SARS-CoV2 PCR positivity and hospitalization for COVID-19. For assessment of the association of medications and COVID-19-related outcomes, we performed a matched nested casecontrol study within the PsD cohort in which each case (SARS-CoV2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization) was matched with 10 controls (negative for these outcomes). Vaccine effectiveness was assessed using regression models with time varying covariates for vaccination status adjusted for demographics, comorbidities and medication use. Results: A total of 128,754 patients with PsD and 600,439 controls (5,934 vs. 26,292 positive SARS-CoV2; 315 vs. 1,127 hospitalized, respectively). Vaccine effectiveness for SARS-CoV2 infection was similar among patients with PsD and controls (HR for 2nd vaccine: 0.20 vs. 0.20, respectively; Figure 1A). Vaccine effectiveness for COVID-19 hospitalization was also similar among PsD patients and controls (HR for 2nd vaccine: 0.15 vs. 0.08, respectively; Figure 2A). Booster vaccines Figure 1.-Vaccine effectiveness for SARS-CoV2 infection in patients with PsD vs. controls (1A) and among patients with PsD alone (1B) remained effective in reducing risk of infections (HRs for of 3rdvaccine: 0.41) and hospitalization (HR for of 3rd vaccine < 0.01) among patients with PsD. When the analysis was restricted to patients with PsD and adjusted for use of systemic therapies, vaccines remained effective for SARS-CoV2 infections (OR period 1: 2nd vaccine: 0.19; OR period 2: 3rd vaccine: < 0.01; Figure 1B) and hospitalizations (OR period 1: 2nd vaccine: 0.01; OR period 2: 3rd vaccine: 0.17; Figure 2B). Use of etanercept was associated with higher risk of SARS-CoV2 infection and JAK inhibitors use was associated with higher risk of hospitalizations (Table 1). PsA status was not associated with higher risk of both outcomes compared to patients with psoriasis alone. Conclusion: The COVID-19 vaccine has similar effectiveness in patients with PsD to that seen in non-psoriatic controls. Risk of COVID-19 hospitalization among PsD patients may be influenced by certain immune modulating therapies.

N2  - Background: One-and two-dose mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by dosing interval and time since vaccination were assessed among healthcare workers (HCWs) in publicly funded acute and community (nonresidential) healthcare facilities in British Columbia, Canada. Methods: A test-negative design was used with controls matched to cases (6:1) on epidemiological week of SARS-CoV-2 test date. mRNA vaccination was defined by receipt of the first dose ?21 days or second dose ?14 days before the test date. HCWs?18 years old tested for SARS-CoV-2 between epi-weeks 3 and 39 (January 17-October 2, 2021) were included, when varying dosing intervals and a mix of circulating variants of concern contributed, including Delta dominance provincially from epi-week 31 (August 1). Results: Single-and two-dose analyses included 1265 and 1246 cases, respectively. The median follow-up period (interquartile range) was 49 (34-69) days for single-dose and 89 (61-123) days for two-dose recipients, with 12%, 31%, and 58% of second doses given 3-5, 6, or?7 weeks after the first. Adjusted mRNA VE against SARS-CoV-2 was 71% (95% CI, 66%-76%) for one dose and 90% (95% CI, 88%-92%) for two doses, similar to two heterologous mRNA doses (92%; 95% CI, 86%-95%). Two-dose VE remained>80% at ?28 weeks post-second dose. Two-dose VE was consistently 5%-7% higher with a?7-week vs 3-5-week interval between doses, but with overlapping confidence intervals. Conclusions: Among HCWs, we report substantial single-dose and strong and sustained two-dose mRNA vaccine protection, with the latter maintained for at least 7 months. These findings support a longer interval between doses, with global health and equity implications.

N2  - Objectives: On 11 March, WHO declared a global pandemic caused by a new virus of the family Coronaviridae that has since been called SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 does not have specific antiviral drug treatment currently. There are currently more than one hundred research projects into vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, and 17 of them are already being tested on humans, according to the WHO. Until we have an effective vaccine, the possible preventive effect of flu vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on cross-reactivity has been postulated. Our objective was to analyse the effect of vaccination against flu virus in the season prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in our hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational cohort study of patients admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV2 infection. We analysed the differences between patients who had received or had not the flu vaccination for the 2019–2020 season. Results: We found no significant differences (p = 0.09) in patients who died (43 in total), of whom 23 (21.5%) were vaccinated against the flu and 20 (13.5%) were not. In mortality, we obtained an adjusted OR = 0.873 (95% CI: 0.294–2.083), and about the success of health care the adjusted OR was 1.447 (95% CI: 0.610–3.430). Conclusions: Flu vaccination in patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection had neither a beneficial nor a harmful effect on the clinical courses or outcomes of patients admitted to an European hospital.

N2  - HIV/AIDS is considered a risk factor for increased mortality due to COVID-19. For this reason, it is essential to include this population in vaccination campaigns. Studies found that antibodies are lower in HIV+ patients than in healthy individuals. The aim of this study was to assess the immune response in a cohort of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccination in order to evaluate the role played by the HIV infection in the efficacy of this vaccine. We carried out a cross-sectional study in the period April-September 2021, involving a cohort of PLWH and a cohort of HIV-uninfected people as the control group. The efficacy of vaccination was high in both groups despite a slight and not significant difference between them. However, important differences were found according to the intensity of the immune response. Specifically, while in the HIV+ group almost a quarter of people had a low response, it is important to remark that the control group had only a high or intermediate response after vaccination. Our results suggest the high efficacy of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in PLWH and the importance to vaccinate against COVID-19 in these patients in order to increase their protection.

N2  - Introduction In Lebanon, the nationwide vaccination against COVID-19 was launched in February-2021 using Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and prioritizing elderly, persons with comorbidities and healthcare workers. Our study aims to estimate the post-introduction vaccine effectiveness (VE) of Pfizer-BioNTech in preventing COVID-19 hospitalization among ≥75 years in Lebanon. Methods A case-control study design was used. Cases were Lebanese, ≥75 years and hospitalized with positive PCR result during April-May 2021. Cases were randomly selected from the COVID-19 database of the Epidemiological Surveillance Unit(ESU) at the Ministry of Public Health(MOPH). Each case was matched by age and locality to 2 controls. Controls were hospitalized, non-COVID-19 patients with negative PCR result, randomly selected from the MOPH hospital admission database. VE was calculated for fully and partially vaccinated, using multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses. Results 345 cases and 814 controls were recruited. Half were females, with a mean age of 83 years. 14 cases(5%) and 143 controls(22%) were fully vaccinated. Bivariate analysis showed significant association with: gender, month of confirmation/admission, general health, chronic medical conditions, main income source and living arrangement. After adjusting for month of admission and gender, multivariate analysis yielded a VE of 82% (95%CI = 69%-90%) against COVID-19 associated hospitalization for those fully vaccinated and 53% (95%CI = 23%-71%) for those partially vaccinated (≥14 days of first or within 14 days of second dose). Conclusions Our study showed that Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is effective in reducing risk for COVID-19-associated hospitalization in Lebanese elderly(≥75 years). Additional studies are warranted to explore vaccine effectiveness in reducing hospitalization in younger age groups, as well as in reducing covid-19 infections.

N2  - Background: Frequent waves of corona virus disease (COVID-19) and lack of specific drugs against that, warrant studies to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this pandemic disease. In this study, we investigated the association between influenza vaccination and the severity and outcome of COVID-19 disease in Iranian patients living in the North. Methods: This retrospective case-control study was performed on186 patients with COVID-19 infection between March and April, 2020. Patients with positive PCR were divided into two groups of case and control; Patients with moderate to severe and normal to mild lung involvement, respectively. The lung opacities in all of the 5 lobes were evaluated on chest CT images using a CT severity scoring system. The history of influenza vaccination during the fall of 2019-2020 was determined by a phone call. Statistical analysis was done using the chi-square test, student’s t-test, and logistic regression. The significance level was p<0.05. Results: The mean age of patients was 54.67±15.05years. Most patients had pulmonary manifestations including ground-glass opacity (57%), consolidation (80%) and pleural effusion (3.2%). Adjusting for age, gender, and history of underlying disease, vaccination is an effective factor in the severity of pulmonary involvement (AOR=0.39; 95%CI: (0.21, 0.73); P=0.003). Furthermore, the chance of ICU admission decreased via influenza vaccination (OR=0.21, P=0.001). Conclusion: The results showed that the severity of COVID-19 pulmonary involvement and outcome as ICU admission, and severe symptoms in patients with history of influenza vaccination were significantly lower than those without history of vaccination. This strategy can be used to prevent and reduce the complications of COVID-19.

N2  - Background: Inflammatory bowel disease potentially elevates the risk of infections, furthermore, disease activity and medical treatment(s) can increase the risk as well. However, both international data and recent studies do not confirm these preliminary conceptions regarding the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, a number of studies have reported that less antibodies are produced against the virus in IBD patients. In January, 2021, the vaccination campaign has begun in Hungary as well, however, questions have been raised about the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine. Methods: In this multicentre study, we assessed the prevalence and risk factors of COVID-19 infection, the willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine and the efficacy of vaccination among IBD patients receiving biological therapy, based on a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study. To assess safety and antibody response to COVID-19 vaccines, we conducted a prospective study in the same Hungarian IBD centers. IgG antibody was quantified to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleocapsid, 1 week before and after the first vaccine and, 4 and, 8 weeks after the second vaccinane, respectively. Results:, 472 patients were enrolled in the first part of our study. SARSCoV- 2 infection was confirmed in, 16.9% of patients. Wearing gloves and masks were found to be effective in preventing infection (p=0.02; p=0.005), avoidance of communal areas had no effect on infection rates. Male sex increased the risk (p=0.008) of viral infection. Based on subjective complaints, UC patients had a worse disease course (p=0.002). Biological therapies did not increase the risk of infections. Patients vaccinated with mRNA vaccine had a significantly higher spike protein antibody titer one month after the second vaccination (p=0.004) compared to other vaccine types (Sinopharm©, Sputnik V©, Astra Zeneca©). Seropositivity was detected in, 98% of patients. Sinopharm © vaccination triggered the lowest number of side effect (p<0.001). SARS-CoV-2 infection induced relapses more frequently than vaccinations. Conclusion: Face mask was the most effective preventive tool. The risk of infection was not increased by biological therapy, therefore therapy discontinuation is not justified. Almost every vaccinated patient developed seropositivity two month after vaccination independently from the type of the vaccine, however, spike protein antibody was significantly higher following mRNA vaccinations.

N2  - Pregnant individuals with COVID-19 infection are at higher risk for hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU admission), and death. After SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, significantly higher rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth and stillbirth have also been observed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate COVID-19 vaccination just before, during, or after delivery and the association with neonatal and maternal outcomes. This study, a population-based retrospective cohort study, used the provincial COVID-19 immunization database (COVaxON) linked to the Better Outcomes Registry & Network Ontario birth registry. From this registry, all pregnancy records with a birth date or due date on or after December 14, 2020 were included. Exclusion criteria included ongoing pregnancies as of September 30, 2020, pregnancy terminations, recordswith gestational age documented as less than 20weeks at birth, and individuals who became pregnant less than 42 weeks before the end of the study period. Results demonstrated that for the specified time frame, 97,590 individuals met inclusion criteria, of whom 22,660 (23%) received at least 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy and 74,930 (77%) did not receive vaccinations by completion of pregnancy. Of these, 44,815 (46%) were vaccinated after pregnancy and 30,115 (31%) were not vaccinated during the study period. Compared with individuals vaccinated after pregnancy, those vaccinated during pregnancy were more likely to reside in higher-income neighborhoods (21.3% vs 17.4%) and were less likely to be 30 years of age or younger (23.7% vs 32.2%). Those vaccinated during pregnancy had no significantly increased risks of postpartum hemorrhage (incidence: 3.0% vs 3.0%), chorioamnionitis (0.5%vs 0.5%), cesarean delivery (30.8%vs 32.2%), neonatal intensive care unit admission (11.0% vs 13.3%), or low Apgar score (1.8% vs 2.0%). The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines administered during pregnancy has been shown to be high in pregnant people. Because COVID-19 vaccine-derived maternal antibodies can cross the placenta, vaccination during pregnancy could also potentially protect newborns in the early months of life, as is seen with vaccination of pregnant individuals for influenza and pertussis. Strengths of this study include large numbers of individuals vaccinated during pregnancy. Population-based data sources limited potential selection bias while also providing detailed information on clinical and sociodemographic variables. COVID-19 vaccination ascertainment took place through linkage with the database that captures all Ontario immunization events, regardless of location within the province. Limitations of the study include its reliance on clinician-assigned outcome diagnoses as recorded in the birth registry, which leaves room for misclassification of outcomes, such as postpartum hemorrhage. This could thereby lean the bias toward the null, which potentially obscures an increased risk, but as these outcomes are not common, any misclassification would provide only a small effect. In addition, given the observational nature of this study, caution should be applied to interpretation of the findings. Despite the inclusion of potential cofounders such as body mass index, smoking, and socioeconomic indicators, other health-related behaviors such as influenza vaccination were excluded and remain potential residual confounders. Finally, there are no data available for vaccination during the first trimester. This study, a population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada found that COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy, as compared with postpartum vaccination or no vaccination, showed no significant associated increased risk of adverse peripartum outcomes. Interpretation of this study should bear inmind that vaccinations administered were primarily mRNAvaccines given in the second and third trimesters.

N2  - Background: HSCT recipients are profoundly immunosuppressed and health care workers (HCW) of transplant units need to be tested periodically by SARS CoV-2 PCR to avoid patient transmission during hospitalization. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study with periodic serology and nasal wash (NW) sampling to estimate the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in health professionals from HSCT unit before (May 2020 to January 2021) and after COVID-19 vaccination (January to October 2021) and to evaluate the occurrence of hospital acquired COVID-19 in HSCT recipients. In addition to periodic sampling, from inclusion (dzero) onwards, HCWs were daily surveyed for the presence of symptoms. NW was taken if symptoms and/or exposure to a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19. If tested positive by PCR, they were away for 14 days and returned to work with at least 1 negative PCR test. Detection of SARSCoV-2 was performed by PCR (RealStarÒ SARSCoV-2, Altona Diagnostics/ Germany) and monthly serology by ELISA (Anti-SARSCoV-2 ELISA, Euroimmun/ Brazil). The incidence of SARSCoV-2/COVID-19 was estimated by cumulative incidence. Study participants received the 1st dose of COVID-19 vaccines (Sinovac/Butantan or Oxford/AstraZeneca/Covishield) between January and March 2021, and the 2nd dose between February and June 2021. Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) was identified by the formula VE = (r0-r1)/r0 (r0 = rate in unvaccinated individuals; r1 = rate in vaccinated). Results: Between May 13, 2020 and March 22, 2021, 109 HCWs were included. The median follow-up was 259 (79-309) days. Before vaccination, 29 cases of SARS CoV-2/COVID-19 were diagnosed at a median of 53 days, for a cumulative incidence of 30 %. Thirteen cases (11.9%) were detected at inclusion and 16 during follow-up. Of the 13 cases detected at inclusion, 8 (30.8%) were diagnosed by serology, showing previous infection. During follow-up, 7 individuals dropped out of the study and one was not vaccinated. Thus, 101 HCWs were included in the post-vaccine analysis. Eight PAS (8%) received chAdOx1 (Oxford/Astrazeneca/Covishield) and 93 (92%) Sinovac (Butantan). After vaccination, 76 of the 78 susceptible HCWs tested positive (97.4%), 1(1.3%) had an indeterminate result, and 1(1.3%) had a negative result after the 2nd dose. Within a median postvaccine follow-up of 153 (91-165) days, 9 HCWs acquired COVID-19 (6 between the first and second dose) for a cumulative incidence of 9.7%. Three (33.35) acquired COVID-19 despite the presence of specific SARS CoV-2 antibodies. Considering only the susceptible subjects at vaccination (n=78), the rate of COVID-19 in unvaccinated (n=29) or partially vaccinated (n=6) was 44.8% (35 of 78) and the rate in those fully vaccinated was 3.8% (3 of 78), for a VE of 91.5%. Due to this intense surveillance of COVID-19 in the HSCT unit, no hospital-acquired COVID-19 was observed in HSCT recipients during the study period. Conclusions: In conclusion, a good serological response was observed after vaccination (97,4%), resulting in a decrease in the incidence of COVID-19 from 30% to 9,7%. The current pandemic scenario continues to represent a great challenge in HSCT units. COVID-19 control policies in HSCT health professionals successfully avoided hospital transmission of SARS CoV-2 to HSCT recipients.

N2  - Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is particularly serious in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), with estimated mortality of over 30% in several studies. In the general population, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has been demonstrated to be an effective approach to preventing infection. However, patients with MM were not included in vaccination trials. Recent studies suggest that patients with compromised immune systems exhibit reduced antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and MM patients are often immunocompromised both due to MM itself and due to MM treatment. Thus, the objective of this retrospective cohort study in the national Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system was to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to prevent COVID-19 infection in MM patients during the 140-day period following initial vaccine availability. Methods This is a multicenter study of SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinated and unvaccinated patients at VA hospitals nationwide during the period from 12/15/2020 to 5/4/2021. We identified a cohort of MM patients who were alive and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection on their date of vaccination or inclusion as a control. For added comparison with a less immunocompromised population, we also identified a cohort of cancer survivors, defined as patients with any solid or hematologic malignancy who had been treated with systemic cancerdirected therapy subsequent to 8/15/2010, but had not been treated with such therapy in the 6 months prior to vaccination or inclusion as a control, and were alive and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection on that date. Vaccinated patients were exactly matched 1:1 to unvaccinated controls on race, VA facility, rurality of home address, cancer type, and treatment timing and modality with minimum distance matching on age. The primary exposure was receipt of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination effectiveness was defined as 1 minus the risk ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection for vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated controls. Results 6,891 MM patients met eligibility criteria and 4,367 were vaccinated during the study period. Of those, 1,606 vaccinated MM patients were matched 1:1 to 1,606 unvaccinated or not yet vaccinated controls. In addition, for comparison, 2,476 vaccinated cancer survivors were matched 1:1 to 2,476 unvaccinated or not yet vaccinated controls. Median follow-up was 44 days among MM patients and 46 days among cancer survivors. Vaccine effectiveness in the matched cohort of MM patients was 22.2% (95% CI, -133 to 82.7%) starting 14 days after the second dose. In contrast, effectiveness was 82.3% (95% CI 16.4 to 100%) starting 14 days after the second dose in the matched cohort of cancer survivors. Among vaccinated MM patients in the matched cohort, 14 (8.7 per 1000 patients) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 subsequent to vaccination. Among vaccinated cancer survivors in the matched cohort, 10 (4.0 per 1000 patients) were infected subsequent to vaccination. Conclusion Vaccination is an effective strategy for preventing SARS-CoV-2. However, effectiveness may be reduced in patients with MM, likely due to a co-existing immunosuppression both due to the disease process as well as associated therapy. Future studies are needed to evaluate the relationship between MM disease states, types of therapy used and treatment timing that may impact vaccine effectiveness, and to also determine if MM patients would benefit from post-vaccination serologies or a booster vaccination.

N2  - Background: Provision of safe and effective vaccines has been a remarkable public health achievement during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The effectiveness and durability of protection of the first two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is an important area for study, as are questions related to optimal dose combinations and dosing intervals. Methods: We performed a case-cohort study to generate real-world evidence on efficacy of first and second dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, using a population-based case line list and vaccination database for the province of Ontario, Canada between December 2020 and October 2021. Risk of infection after vaccination was evaluated in all laboratory-confirmed vaccinated SARS-CoV-2 cases, and a 2% sample of vaccinated controls, evaluated using survival analytic methods, including construction of Cox proportional hazards models. Vaccination status was treated as a time-varying covariate. Results: First and second doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine markedly reduced risk of infection (first dose efficacy 68%, 95% CI 67% to 69%; second dose efficacy 88%, 95% CI 87 to 88%). In multivariable models, extended dosing intervals were associated with lowest risk of breakthrough infection (HR for redosing 0.64 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.67) at 6-8 weeks). Heterologous vaccine schedules that mixed viral vector vaccine first doses with mRNA second doses were significantly more effective than mRNA only vaccines. Risk of infection largely vanished during the time period 4-6 months after the second vaccine dose, but rose markedly thereafter. Interpretation: A case-cohort design provided an efficient means to identify strong protective effects associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, particularly after the second dose of vaccine. However, this effect appeared to wane once more than 6 months had elapsed since vaccination. Heterologous vaccination and extended dosing intervals improved the durability of immune response.

N2  - Introduction: In late 2019, a novel coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread throughout the world causing coronavirus disease (COVID-19). End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) populations are vulnerable group with high mortality when contracted COVID-19. We aimed to determine the effects of vaccine on the severity and mortality rate of COVID-19 infection among ESKD population in Malaysia. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study on the COVID19 infection among ESKD patients on maintenance dialysis, who were admitted for COVID-19 from 1stMay 2021 till 15thSeptember 2021 at Sultanah Aminah Hospital and Sultanah Nora Ismail Hospital in Johor, confirmed by either a positive RTK-Ag or RT-PCR SARS-CoV2 tests. Demographic, clinical, and vaccination data were collected. Subjects who had breakthrough COVID-19 at least 14 days after second dose of SARS-CoV2 vaccines were defined as “Vaccine” group (VG), while “no vaccine” group (NVG) included “Incompletely Vaccinated” (those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 within 14 days of second vaccine dose or received only first dose) or “Unvaccinated” when diagnosed with COVID-19. Severity of COVID-19 was classified into 5 categories as per Malaysian COVID-19 clinical practice guideline. The severity of infection were further dichotomised as mild-moderate (category 1-3) and severe (category 4-5) for analysis. We compared the demographic and clinical outcomes of VG vs NVG. Results: A total of 303 patients were recruited. Mean age was 57.3 (44.2-70.4) years old, while 53.8% had diabetes mellitus (DM) and 9.6% had cardiovascular disease (CVD). 148 (48.8%) and 155 (51.2%) belongs to VG and NVG respectively. There were no differences in the mean age, gender, prevalence of DM, modality of renal replacement therapy and diagnosis of primary disease between the two groups, but there was higher prevalence of CVD in the NVG vs VG (12.9% vs 6.1%, p = 0.044). Overall, 145 (47.9%) had mild-moderate infection, while 158 (52.1%) had severe infection. Mean CT value was 23.96 +/- 6.90. 78 (25.7%) subjects from overall cohort died from the infection. VG had similar CT value compared to NVG (23.99 vs 23.93, p = 0.953). However, the VG had lower incidence of severe infection (33.8% vs 69.7%, p < 0.001) and lower mortality rate (12.2% vs 38.7%, p < 0.001) compared to NVG. Increasing age, DM, CVD and lower CT values were predictors of death. The unadjusted mortality odds ratio (OR) of “Incompletely Vaccinated” group” and “Unvaccinated” group” were 0.965 (p = 0.924) and 0.217 (p < 0.001) respectively. Multiple logistic regression showed vaccination and CT value were independent predictors of death. [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Conclusions: Two doses of COVID-19 vaccine is effective in reducing the severity and mortality of COVID-19 in the ESKD population. The durability of this protective effects remained unclear. Studies to determine the need and effectiveness of booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine will be useful in this vulnerable population.

N2  - Introduction: Healthcare workers (HCW) were amongst the first prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination but data on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness among HCW is still limited. This study aims to estimate the COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic infection among HCW from Portuguese hospitals. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, we analysed data from HCW (all professional categories) from two central hospitals in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley and Centre regions of mainland Portugal between December 2020 and November 2021. VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated as one minus the confounder adjusted hazard ratios by Cox models considering age group, sex, presence of chronic disease and occupational exposure to patients diagnosed with COVID-19 as adjustment variables. Results: During the 11 months of follow up, the 2213 HCW contributed a total of 1950 person-years at risk and 171 SARS-CoV-2 events occurred. The COVID-19 incidence rate for unvaccinated HCW was 348.7 per 1000 person-years while for fully vaccinated HCW was 43.0 per 1000 person-years. We observed a VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection of 73.9% (95% CI: 26.2–90.8%) for complete vaccination status. Conclusion: This cohort study found a high COVID-19 VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in Portuguese HCW, which is in concordance with previous studies from other countries. Monitoring of VE in this HCW cohort continues during the winter 2021/2022 to evaluate potential VE decay and booster vaccine effect.

N2  - Patients with CLL have high rates of either severe disease or death from COVID-19 and a low response rate after COVID-19 vaccination has been reported. We conducted a single-center study with the main objective to evaluate the immunogenicity of the BNT1162b2 mRNA vaccines in 42 patients affected by CLL with the assessment of antibody response after the second and the third dose. After the second dose of vaccine, 13 patients (30%) showed an antibody response. The presence of hypogammaglobulinemia and the use of steroids or IVIG were the main factors associated with poor response. After the third dose, 5/27 (18%) patients showed an antibody response while in non-responders to the second dose, only 1 patient (4%) showed an elicitation of the immune response by the third dose, with no statistically significant difference. Our data, despite the small size of our cohort, demonstrate that patients with CLL have a low rate of effective response to the BNT162b2 vaccine. However, the effective role of a subsequent dose is still unclear, highlighting the need for alternative methods of immunization in this particularly fragile group of patients.

N2  - Introduction We sought to evaluate the longitudinal serological response from the second to third dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in liver transplant recipients at our institution. This study is ongoing and the total N will increase. Methods We prospectively enrolled 54 LT patients who received Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine in two doses 3-4 weeks apart at our institution and an additional third dose after CDC approval in August 2021. 6 patients were excluded because of a positive nucleocapsid Ab after the third dose that indicated prior COVID infection. Recipients had semi-quantitative spike IgG and nucleocapsid IgG titers tested between 30 and 75 days after receiving a second vaccine dose. Serological responses to both spike and nucleocapsid antigens indicated COVID-19 infection. All recipients had spike and nucleocapsid Ab titers checked at least 14 days after receiving the third dose. Recipients who had a positive spike Ab titer and negative nucleocapsid titer after a second vaccine dose had repeat spike and nucleocapsid Ab testing within 1 week prior to receiving their third vaccine dose. Results Among 48 LT recipients that met inclusion criteria, seropositivity for spike Ab increased from 47.9% after the second dose to 81.3% after the third dose. 9 patients who were seronegative after a third dose had failed to develop detectable spike Ab after their second dose. The median interval between the second and third doses was 5.9 months. After the third dose, 69% of seropositive recipients had a high spike Ab titer. In 25 recipients who were seronegative after a second dose, 64% produced spike Abs after their third dose. Recipients who remained seronegative after 3 vaccine doses had significantly higher mean tacrolimus trough concentrations. To assess whether spike Ab titers waned after the second vaccine dose, we retested spike Ab titers within one week prior to the third dose in 14 out of 23 recipients who were seropositive after their second dose. All 14 patients had a decline in their spike Ab titers after their second dose. Previously detectable spike Ab titers became undetectable in 5 recipients. However, all five of these patients regained detectable spike Ab after the third vaccine. Discussion We demonstrate that a third dose of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in LT recipients was effective. Minimizing immunosuppression by lowering tacrolimus trough thresholds is one potential strategy to improve immune responses. Our results also provide useful information about the optimal interval between the second and third vaccine doses in SOT recipients. Our cohort received the third vaccine dose after a longer delay of 6 months. With this delay, we demonstrated higher seropositivity and seroconversion rates than those reported after shorter interval dosing. A shorter delay between doses is a practical approach to help mitigate the immediate risk in this population. (Table Presented)

N2  - Objectives: The rapid spread of the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) alongside evidence of a relatively rapid waning of the third dose prompted Israel to administer a fourth dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine on January 2022. Thus far, sufficient real-world evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of a fourth dose against infection and severe COVID-19 are lacking. This study examined the short-term effectiveness of a fourth dose compared to three doses over the span of 10 weeks. Design: A retrospective test-negative case-control study, performing both a matched analysis and an unmatched multiple-tests analysis. Setting: Nationally centralized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), an Israeli national health fund that covers 2.5 million people. Participants: The study population included 97,499 MHS members aged 60 or older who were eligible to receive a fourth vaccine dose and performed at least one PCR test during the study period. Of them, 27,876 received the fourth dose and 69,623 received only three doses. Main outcomes and measures: Analyses focused on the period from January 10, 2022 (7 days after the fourth dose was first administered to eligible individuals) to March 13, 2022, an Omicron-dominant period in Israel. We evaluated two SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes: (1) breakthrough infection, defined as a positive PCR test performed 7 or more days after inoculation with the BNT162b2 vaccine; and (2) breakthrough infection resulting in a severe disease, defined as COVID-19-related hospitalization or COVID-19 associated mortality. Results: A fourth dose provided considerable additional protection against both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease relative to three doses of the vaccine. However, vaccine effectiveness against infection varied over time, peaking during the third week with a VE of 64% (95% CI: 62.0%-65.9%) and declining to 29.2% (95% CI: 17.7%-39.1%) by the end of the 10-week follow-up period. Unlike VE against infection, the relative effectiveness of a fourth dose against severe COVID-19 was maintained at high level (>73%) throughout the 9-week follow-up period. Importantly, severe disease was a relatively rare event, occurring in <1% of both fourth dose and third dose only recipients. Conclusions: A fourth dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine provided considerable additional protection against both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease relative to three doses of the vaccine. However, effectiveness of the fourth dose against infection wanes sooner than that of the third dose.

N2  - Background: Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is recommended for all persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) to prevent severe COVID infections and death. However, it is unknown how many pwMS are fully vaccinated or have received a booster dose and whether vaccination patterns differ across patient subgroups. In addition, there is limited research evaluating COVID outcomes by vaccination status among pwMS despite concerns that pwMS receiving immunosuppressive therapies might have an impaired immune response that could impact vaccine effectiveness. Objective: To describe COVID vaccination patterns and COVID outcomes among pwMS in the FlywheelMS cohort and in subgroups of pwMS, including by disease-modifying therapy (DMT) status. Methods: All pwMS included in the FlywheelMS cohort, a patient-centred study that digitises all health records for US-based pwMS across all US sites of care, were asked to complete a questionnaire on their COVID vaccination history (completed 2 July-4 May 2022). COVID diagnoses and outcomes were identified in health records. Vaccination rates were calculated for all pwMS overall and in subgroups, including by index DMT (i.e. the most recent DMT in the 6 months prior to vaccination). Breakthrough infections >14 days after the last dose of the primary vaccine series and COVID-related outcomes (i.e. hospitalisation, severe hospitalisation, death) were evaluated overall and in subgroups of pwMS, including by DMT status. Results: A total of 1041 pwMS (20% response rate) completed the survey and were included in the study: 182 (17%) were unvaccinated, 11 (1%) were partially vaccinated and 848 (81%) were fully vaccinated. Among the fully vaccinated, 595 (70%) received 1 and 47 (6%) received ≥2 booster/additional doses. Fully vaccinated pwMS were more likely to be older (mean age, 50 vs 49 years), male (22% vs 13%) and treated with any DMT (76% vs 63%) compared with unvaccinated pwMS. Among all fully vaccinated pwMS, 48 (6%) had a documented breakthrough infection after vaccination. Vaccination rates and outcomes following breakthrough infections (i.e. hospitalisation, severe hospitalisation, death) for subgroups will be presented in the full poster. Conclusions: Rates of full vaccination and boosters were higher among pwMS compared with all adults in the US. The documented breakthrough rate among fully vaccinated pwMS was low and similar to that in the general population, suggesting vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 provides benefits among pwMS.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Recent observational studies suggest that vaccines may have little effect in preventing infection with the Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. However, the observed effects may be confounded by patient factors, preventive behaviours, or differences in testing behaviour. To assess potential confounding, we examined differences in testing behaviour between unvaccinated and vaccinated populations. METHODS: We recruited 1,526 Australian adults for an online ran-domized study about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing in late 2021, collecting self-reported vaccination status and three measures of COVID-19 testing behaviour: testing in past month or ever and test intention if they woke with a sore throat. We examined the association between testing intentions and vaccination status in the trial’s baseline data. RESULTS: Of the 1,526 participants (mean age 31 y), 22% had a COVID-19 test in the past month and 61% ever; 17% were unvaccinated, 11% were partially vaccinated (one dose), and 71% were fully vaccinated (two or more doses). Fully vaccinated participants were twice as likely as those who were unvaccinated (relative risk [RR] 2.2, 95% CI 1.8 to 2.8, p < 0.001) to report positive COVID testing intentions. Partially vaccinated participants had less positive intentions than fully vaccinated participants (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.89, p < 0.001) but higher intentions than unvaccinated participants (RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.4 to 1.6, p = 0.002). DISCUSSION: Vaccination predicted greater COVID-19 testing intentions and would substantially bias observed vaccine effectiveness. To account for differential testing behaviours, test-negative designs are currently the preferred option, but their assumptions need more thorough examination.

N2  - Background Recent observational studies have suggested that vaccines for the omicron variant of SARS-Cov2 may have little or no effect in preventing infection. However, the observed effects may be confounded by patient factors and preventive behaviours or vaccine-related differences in testing behaviour. To assess the potential degree of confounding, we aimed to estimate differences in testing behaviour between unvaccinated and vaccinated populations. Methods We recruited 1,526 Australian adults for an online randomised study about COVID testing between October and November 2021, and collected self-reported vaccination status and three measures of COVID-19 testing behaviour. We examined the association between testing intentions and vaccination status in the cross-sectional baseline data of this trial. Results Of the 1,526 participants (mean age 31 years): 22% had a COVID-19 test in the past month and 61% ever; 17% were unvaccinated, 11% were partially vaccinated (1 dose), 71% were fully vaccinated (2+ doses). Fully vaccinated participants were twice as likely (RR 2.2; 95% CI 1.8 to 2.8) to report positive COVID testing intentions than those who were unvaccinated (p<.001). Partially vaccinated participants had less positive intentions than those fully vaccinated (p<.001) but higher intentions than those who were unvaccinated (p=.002). Discussion For all three measures vaccination predicted greater COVID testing intentions. If the unvaccinated tested at half the rate of the vaccinated, a true vaccine effectiveness of 30% could appear to be a “negative” observed vaccine effectiveness of -40%. Assessing vaccine effectiveness should use methods to account for differential testing behaviours. Test negative designs are currently the preferred option, but its assumptions should be more thoroughly examined.

N2  - Background: We report breakthrough infections (BTIs) during periods of circulating Beta, Delta and Omicron variants of concern, among health care workers (HCW) participating in the Sisonke phase 3B Ad26.COV2.S vaccine trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04838795). Data were gathered between 17 February and 15 December 2021. Duration of each period in this study was 89 days for Beta, 180 days or Delta and 30 days for Omicron. Results: A total of 40 538 BTIs were observed, with 609 during Beta, 22 279 during Delta and 17 650 during Omicron. By 15 December, daily infections during Omicron were three times that seen during the peak observed during Delta. However, unlike the Delta period, with Omicron there was a clear and early de-coupling of hospitalisation from cases as a percentage of the Delta peak curves. Omicron significantly infected a greater proportion of HCW in the 18-30 year age-group, compared with the 55+ age group. There were 1 914 BTI-related hospitalisations - 77, 1 429 and 408 in the Beta (89 days), Delta (180 days) and Omicron (30 days) periods, respectively. During Omicron, 91% hospitalized HCWs required general ward care, 6% high care and 3% intensive care, compared with 89% general ward care, 4% high care and 7% intensive care, during Delta and 78% general care, 7% high care and 16% intensive care during Beta (p<0.001). During Beta and Beta 43% of hospitalized HCW needed supplementary oxygen and 7-8% needed ventilation, compared with 16% and 0.2% respectively during the Omicron period (p<0.001). Median length of hospitalization was significantly lower with Omicron compared with Beta and Delta (3 days compared with 5-6 days, p<0.001). Conclusions: We illustrate more BTIs but reassuringly less severe Covid-19 with Omicron. Reinfections and Omicron-driven primary infections were likely driven by high population SARSCoV-2 seroprevalence, waning vaccine effectiveness over time, increased Omicron infectivity, Omicron immune evasion or a combination of these and need further investigation. Follow-up of this cohort will continue and reports will be updated, as time and infections accrue.

N2  - Background: Dialysis patients are extremely vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We recently reported the results of a prospective cohort study measuring serial monthly semi quantitative IgG antibody levels to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain in fully vaccinated in-center hemodialysis patients after receiving the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA vaccination. Methods: Prospective cohort study measuring the serologic response of hemodialysis patients to a booster dose of BNT162b2 vaccine at an average of 2, 6 and 11 weeks post vaccination. Results: Of 35 hemodialysis patients in the original cohort, 27 (77.1%) received a third dose of BNT162b2. Antibody level significantly increased from pre-booster to 2 weeks post-booster (median (25th, 75th percentile) from 59.94 (29.69, 177.8) to 6216 (3806, 11730)), an average increase of 112 fold. Antibody levels dropped to a median of 2654 BAU/mL (1650, 8340) 6 weeks post-booster and to a median of 1444 BAU/mL (1102, 2020) between weeks 6 and 11 post-booster. Antibody levels at 11 weeks remained an average of 40 fold higher than pre-booster levels. Overall, antibody levels declined 47% month to month post-booster. Nine (33%) patients had negative or borderline detectable antibody levels pre-booster and 8 of 9 developed positive (>35.2 BAU/mL) antibody levels post-booster. Those with prior infection had a lower proportional increase in antibody level (51 fold) compared with the median change in COVID naïve patients (144 fold) from pre-booster to 2 weeks post-booster. Conclusions: Our data demonstrates that hemodialysis patients obtain a robust humoral response from a third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine although antibody levels wane over time.

N2  - Background: Patients with End Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD) on dialysis are extremely vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antibody levels decline in the months following the standard two-dose vaccination series with Pfizer BioNTech (BNT162b2) mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in hemodialysis patients. Current guidelines recommend boosters of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccines. The aim of this study was to determine the humoral response of hemodialysis patients to a third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Methods: Prospective cohort study measuring the serologic response of hemodialysis patients to a booster dose of BNT162b2 vaccine at an average of 2, 6 and 11 weeks post vaccination. The Anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac ELISA (IgG) from Euroimmun (EUROIMMUN US, Inc.) was used in all assessments. Differences in antibody levels over time were compared non-parametrically using the Friedman test, then tested pairwisely with Bonferroni correction at alpha of < 0.05. A linear mixed model was used to estimate the decline in slope after vaccination. Results: Of 35 hemodialysis patients in the original cohort, 27 (77.1%) received a third dose of BNT162b2. Antibody level significantly increased from pre-booster to 2 weeks post-booster (median (25th, 75th percentile) from 59.94 (29.69, 177.8) to 6216 (3806, 11730)), an average increase of 112 fold. Antibody levels dropped an average of 36.3% to a median of 2654 BAU/mL (1650, 8340) at 6 weeks post-booster. From weeks 6 to 11 post-booster, antibody levels dropped to a median of 1444 BAU/mL (1102, 2020), corresponding to a 52.4% average decrease. Overall, antibody levels declined 47% month to month post-booster. Still, antibody levels at 11 weeks remained an average of 40 fold higher than pre-booster levels. Nine (33%) patients had negative or borderline detectable antibody levels pre-booster and 8 of 9 developed positive (>35.2 BAU/mL) antibody levels post-booster. Those with prior infection had a lower proportional increase in antibody level (51 fold) compared with the median change in COVID naïve patients (144 fold) from pre-booster to 2 weeks post-booster. Conclusions: Following a third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, hemodialysis patients obtain a robust humoral response although antibody levels wane over time.

N2  - Background: Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are effective in the general population. Dialysis patients are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection with high morbidity and mortality. Beginning in January of 2021, the University of Virginia Dialysis Program initiated a program wide vaccination campaign administering Pfizer BioNTech mRNA SARS-CoV-2 (BNT162b2) vaccine. The aim of this study was to characterize the long term time-dependent decline in humoral immunity in hemodialysis patients. Methods: 35 adult hemodialysis patients were recruited to receive two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. From 2 to 6 months post vaccination, monthly semi quantitative IgG antibody levels to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain were obtained. To analyze the change in antibody levels over time, a linear mixed model with random slope and random intercept was used for longitudinal antibody levels. A multivariable model was used to estimate the slope of antibody levels by adjusting for selected patient characteristics. Based on the estimated intercepts and slopes for each subject from the unadjusted model, 10-month antibody levels were projected. Results: The mean baseline antibody level was 647.59 BAU/mL and 87.88% (29/33) of patients were considered qualitatively positive. Two patients were negative at baseline and an additional two had borderline results. Patient antibody levels declined at an adjusted average rate of 31% per month. At 6 months post vaccination, 40% of patients remaining in the cohort possessed either negative or borderline IgG antibody levels. Immune suppressed patients, on average, had a 65% lower antibody level compared to patients without immune suppression and patients with prior COVID-19 infection had 5 times higher antibody levels than infection naïve patients. Projecting future antibody levels based on the slopes of antibody level decay suggests 65% of the cohort will progress to borderline or negative antibody levels at 10 months post full vaccination if additional doses are not administered. Conclusions: The long term vaccine response of hemodialysis patients vaccinated with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was characterized. Our data demonstrates the decline in humoral immunity over time and emphasizes the crucial need for vaccine boosters in this population.

N2  - To distinguish waning of vaccine responses from differential variant protection, we performed a test-negative case-control analysis during a Delta variant-dominant period in California's prisons. We found that infection odds increased each 28-day period post-vaccination, reaching 3.4-fold (residents) to 4.7-fold (staff) increased odds of infection after 180 days.

N2  - Objectives: To estimate the protection against laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisations, and death after homologous or heterologous third-dose (booster) in individuals with primary vaccination schemes with rAd26-rAd5, ChAdOx1nCoV-19, BBIBP-CorV or heterologous combinations, during the period of Omicron BA.1 predominance. Design: Retrospective, test-negative, case-control study, with matched analysis. Setting: Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, between 12/1/21-4/1/21. Participants: 422,144 individuals ≥50 years who had received two or three doses of COVID-19 vaccines and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Main outcome measures: Odds ratios of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisations and death after administering different boosters, compared to a two-dose primary scheme. Results: Of 221,933(52.5%) individuals with a positive test, 190,884(45.2%) had received a two-dose vaccination scheme and 231,260(54.8%) a three-dose scheme. The matched analysis included 127,014 cases and 180,714 controls. The three-dose scheme reduced infections (OR 0.81[0.80-0.83]) but after 60 days protection dropped (OR 1.04[1.01-1.06]). The booster dose decreased the risk of hospitalisations and deaths after 15-59 days (ORs 0.28[0.25-0.32] and 0.25[0.22-0.28] respectively), which persisted after administration for 75[66-89] days. Administration of a homologous booster after a primary scheme with vectored-vaccines provided low protection against infections (OR 0.94[0.92-0.97] and 1.05[1.01-1.09] before and after 60 days). Protection against hospitalisations and death was significant (OR 0.30[0.26-0.35] and 0.29[0.25-0.33] respectively) but decreased after 60 days (OR 0.59[0.47-0.74] and 0.51[0.41- 0.64] respectively). The inoculation of a heterologous booster after a primary course with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, rAd26-rAd5, BBIBP-CorV, or heterologous schemes, offered some protection against infection (OR 0.70[0.68-0.71]), which decreased after 60 days (OR 1.01[0.98-1.04]). The protective effect against hospitalisations and deaths (OR 0.26[0.22-0.31] and 0.22[0.18-0.25] respectively) was clear and persisted after 60 days (OR 0.43[0.35-0.53] and 0.33[0.26-0.41]). Conclusions: This study shows that, during Omicron predominance, heterologous boosters provide an enhanced protection and longer effect duration against COVID-19-related hospitalisations and death in individuals older than 50, compared to homologous boosters.

N2  - Background The continued occurrence of more contagious SARS-CoV-2 variants and waning immunity over time require ongoing re-evaluation of the vaccine effectiveness (VE). This study aimed to estimate the effectiveness in two age groups (12-59 and 60 years or above) of two and three vaccine doses (BNT162b2 mRNA or mRNA-1273 vaccine) by time since vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization in an Alpha, Delta and Omicron dominated period. Methods A Danish nationwide cohort study design was used to estimate VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization with the Alpha, Delta and Omicron variants. Information was obtained from nationwide registries and linked using a unique personal identification number. The study included all residents in Denmark aged 12 years or above (18 years or above for the analysis of three doses) in the Alpha (February 20 to June 15, 2021), Delta (July 4 to November 20, 2021) and Omicron (December 21, 2021 to January 31, 2022) dominated periods. VE estimates including 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazard regression models with adjustments for age, sex and geographical region. Vaccination status was included as a time-varying exposure. Findings In the oldest age group, VE against infection after two doses was 91.0% (95% CI: 88.5; 92.9) for the Alpha variant, 82.2% (95% CI: 75.3; 87.1) for the Delta variant and 39.9% (95% CI: 26.4; 50.9) for the Omicron variant 14-30 days since vaccination. The VE waned over time and was 71.5% (95% CI: 54.7; 82.8), 49.8% (95% CI: 46.5; 52.8) and 4.7% (95% CI: 0.2; 8.9) >120 days since vaccination against the three variants, respectively. Higher estimates were observed after the third dose with VE estimates against infection of 86.0% (Delta, 95% CI: 83.3; 88.3) and 57.6% (Omicron, 95% CI: 55.8; 59.4) 14-30 days since vaccination. Among both age groups, VE against COVID-19-related hospitalization 14-30 days since vaccination with two or three doses was 94.8% or above for the Alpha and Delta variants, whereas among the youngest age group, VE estimates against the Omicron variant after two and three doses were 62.4% (95% CI: 46.3; 73.6) and 89.8% (95% CI: 87.9; 91.3), respectively. Conclusions Two vaccine doses provided high protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization with the Alpha and Delta variants with protection waning over time. Two vaccine doses provided only limited protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization with the Omicron variant. The third vaccine dose substantially increased the protection against Delta and Omicron.

N2  - Background: The Sisonke Phase IIIB open-label implementation study vaccinated health care workers (HCWs) with the single dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine during two phases of the South African Covid-19 epidemic, dominated first by the Beta followed by the Delta variant of concern. Methods: HCWs were vaccinated over 3 months (17 February-17 May 2021). Safety was monitored by self-reporting, facility reporting and linkage to national databases. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against Covid-19 related hospitalisation, hospitalisation requiring critical or intensive care and death, ascertained 28 days or more post vaccination was assessed up until 17 July 2021. Nested sub-cohorts (A and B) from two national medical schemes were evaluated to assess VE using a matched retrospective cohort design. Results: Over the 3-month period, 477234 HCWs were vaccinated in 122 vaccination sites across South Africa. VE derived from the sub-cohorts comprising 215 813 HCWs was 83% (95% CI 75-89) to prevent Covid-19 deaths, 75% (95% CI 69-82) to prevent hospital admissions requiring critical or intensive care and 67% (95% CI 62-71) to prevent Covid-19 related hospitalisations. The VE was maintained in older HCWs and those with comorbidities including HIV infection. VE remained consistent throughout the Beta and Delta dominant phases of the study. 10279 adverse events were reported and 139 (1.4%) were serious, including two cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome and four cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome who recovered. Conclusion: The single dose Ad26.COV2.S was safe and effective against severe Covid-19 disease and death post-vaccination, and against both Beta and Delta variants providing real-world evidence for its use globally.

N2  - To inform public health policy, it is critical to monitor COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE), including against acquiring infection. We estimated VE using a retrospective cohort study among repeat blood donors who donated during the first half of 2021, demonstrating a viable approach for monitoring of VE via serological surveillance. Using Poisson regression, we estimated overall VE was 88.8% (95% CI: 86.2–91.1), adjusted for demographic covariates and variable baseline risk. Time since first reporting vaccination, age, race-ethnicity, region, and calendar time were statistically significant predictors of incident infection. Studies of VE during periods of Delta and Omicron spread are underway.

N2  - Background While the vaccines against COVID-19 are considered to be highly effective, COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough is likely and a small number of people will still fall ill, be hospitalised, or die from COVID-19, despite being fully vaccinated. With the continued increase in numbers of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, describing the characters of individuals who have experienced a COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough could be hugely important in helping to determine who may be at greatest risk. Method With the approval of NHS England we conducted a retrospective cohort study using routine clinical data from the OpenSAFELY TPP database of fully vaccinated individuals, linked to secondary care and death registry data, and described the characteristics of those experiencing a COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough. Results As of 01st November 2021, a total of 15,436,455 individuals were identified as being fully vaccinated against COVID-19, with a median follow-up time of 149 days (IQR: 107-179). From within this population, a total of 577245 (<4%) individuals reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. For every 1000 years of patient follow-up time, the corresponding incidence rate was 98.02 (95% CI 97.9-98.15). There were 16,120 COVID-19-related hospital admissions, 1,100 COVID-19 critical care admission patients and 3,925 COVID-19-related deaths; corresponding incidence rates of 2.72 (95% C 2.7-2.74), 0.19 (95% C 0.18-0.19) and 0.66 (95% C 0.65-0.67), respectively. When broken down by the initial priority group, higher rates of hospitalisation and death were seen in those in care homes and those over 80 years of age. Comorbidities with the highest rates of breakthrough COVID-19 included chronic kidney disease, dialysis, transplant, haematological malignancy, and immunocompromised. Conclusion The majority of COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough cases in England were mild with relatively few fully vaccinated individuals being hospitalised or dying as a result. However, some concerning differences in rates of breakthrough cases were identified in several clinical and demographic groups. While it is important to note that these findings are simply descriptive and cannot be used to answer why certain groups have higher rates of COVID-19 breakthrough than others, the emergence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 coupled with the continued increase in numbers of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests are concerning. As numbers of fully vaccinated individuals increases and follow-up time lengthens, so too will the number of COVID-19 breakthrough cases. Additional analyses, aimed at identifying individuals at higher risk, are therefore required.

N2  - Background: As of December 30, 2021, Ontario long-term care (LTC) residents who received a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine ≥84 days previously were offered a fourth dose to prevent a surge in COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality due to the Omicron variant. Seven months have passed since fourth doses were implemented, allowing for the examination of fourth dose protection over time. Methods: We used a test-negative design and linked databases to estimate the marginal effectiveness (4 versus 3 doses) and vaccine effectiveness (VE; 2, 3, or 4 doses versus no doses) of mRNA vaccines among Ontario LTC residents aged ≥60 years who were tested for SARSCoV-2 between December 30, 2021 and August 3, 2022. Outcome measures included any Omicron infection, symptomatic infection, and severe outcomes (hospitalization or death). Results: We included 21,275 Omicron cases and 273,466 test-negative controls. The marginal effectiveness of a fourth dose <84 days ago compared to a third dose received ≥84 days ago was 23% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 17-29%), 36% (95%CI 26-44%), and 37% (95%CI 24-48%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic infection, and severe outcomes, respectively. Additional protection provided by a fourth dose compared to a third dose was negligible against all outcomes ≥168 days after vaccination. Compared to unvaccinated individuals, vaccine effectiveness (VE) of a fourth dose decreased from 49% (95%CI 44%-54%) to 18% (95%CI 5-28%) against infection, 69% (95%CI 62-75%) to 44% (95%CI 24-59%) against symptomatic infection, and 82% (95%CI 77-86%) to 74% (95%CI 62-82%) against severe outcomes <84 days versus ≥168 days after vaccination. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that fourth doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines provide additional protection against Omicron-related outcomes in LTC residents, but the protection wanes over time, with more waning seen against infection than severe outcomes.

Outcome measures included any Omicron infection, symptomatic infection, and severe outcomes (hospitalization or death). Results: We included 13,654 Omicron cases and 205,862 test-negative controls. The marginal effectiveness of a fourth dose (with 95% of fourth dose vaccine recipients receiving mRNA-1273) ≥7 days after vaccination versus a third dose received ≥84 days prior was 19% (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 12-26%) against infection, 31% (95%CI, 20-41%) against symptomatic infection, and 40% (95%CI, 24-52%) against severe outcomes. VE (compared to an unvaccinated group) increased with each additional dose, and for a fourth dose was 49% (95%CI, 43-54%), 69% (95%CI, 61-76%), and 86% (95%CI, 81-90%), against infection, symptomatic infection, and severe outcomes, respectively. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that compared to a third dose received ≥84 days ago, a fourth dose improved protection against infection, symptomatic infection, and severe outcomes caused by Omicron among long-term care residents. Compared to unvaccinated individuals, fourth doses provide strong protection against severe outcomes, but the duration of protection remains unknown.

N2  - Background. It is unknown whether administering the second BNT162B2 vaccine dose on the cross-arm or the same arm as the first dose creates a more robust local and systemic immune response leading to favorable clinical results. We used data from Israel's largest healthcare provider (Clalit health services [CHS]) to assess the impact on vaccine effectiveness of contralateral vs. ipsilateral administration of BNT162b2. Methods. A retrospective cohort study, conducted on all CHS members who received the BNT162b2 vaccine between December 2020 and December 2021. The primary endpoint was a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 between 10 days and 38 days after the administration of the second dose of bnt162b2. A logistic regression model was used to compare the likelihood of COVID-19 infection at different time intervals following vaccination. Results. During the study, 2,678,226 CHS members received both doses of BNT162b and were eligible for analysis. Of these, 2,367,694 (88.41%) received the first two doses of the vaccine on the same arm (ipsilateral). The primary endpoint was observed in 2061 (0.077%) participants. The primary endpoint was observed more frequently in the contralateral vs. the ipsilateral group. The adjusted odds ratio for occurrence of the primary endpoint in the ipsilateral vs. the contralateral group was 0.83 (95% CI 0.73-0.94 P=0.004). Statistically significant reduction in OR was also observed in two of our secondary outcomes - hospitalization due to COVID-19 and all-cause mortality. Conclusion. Our study suggests that administration of the first and second BNT162b doses in the same arm, might increase vaccine effectiveness in the short term, possibly due to more robust local lymph node activation. This intervention could have a dramatic effect on public health. Further studies are needed to assess the long-term effectiveness of our findings.

N2  - TYPE: Abstract TOPIC: Chest Infections PURPOSE: To better understand reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy so as to better target education efforts. METHODS: Consecutive unvaccinated patients evaluated for admission to the Intensive Care Unit due to COVID-19 infection were asked their reason(s) for not being vaccinated. Reasons were categorized and presented along with basic demographic data. RESULTS: CONCLUSIONS: The most common reasons for not getting vaccinated included fear of potential side effects, and the perception that the vaccine was too new. Severity of COVID-19 and access to vaccination were less frequently reported. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The unvaccinated population of COVID-19 patients is by far the number one driver of morbidity and mortality from this disease. Vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent severe illness yet vaccine refussal remains at unacceptably high rates. This study provides a glimpse into the real world reasons why patients in a single community who end up very ill have not gotten vaccinated. Providing education highlighting the safety of the vaccine, including its exceptional track record and wide use, appears to be essential to vaccine acceptance in this cohort. Understanding the reasons individuals decline vaccination on a local level is crucial in targeting education and additional resources. DISCLOSURE: Nothing to declare. KEYWORD: COVID-19

N2  - Background: Understanding the duration and effectiveness of infection and vaccine-acquired SARS-CoV-2 immunity is essential to inform pandemic policy interventions, including the timing of vaccine-boosters. We investigated this in our large prospective cohort of UK healthcare workers undergoing routine asymptomatic PCR testing. Methods We assessed vaccine effectiveness (VE) (up to 10-months after first dose) and infection-acquired immunity by comparing time to PCR-confirmed infection in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals using a Cox regression-model, adjusted by prior SARS-CoV-2 infection status, vaccine-manufacturer/dosing-interval, demographics and workplace exposures. Results Of 35,768 participants, 27% (n=9,488) had a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccine coverage was high: 97% had two-doses (79% BNT162b2 long-interval, 8% BNT162b2 short-interval, 8% ChAdOx1). There were 2,747 primary infections and 210 reinfections between 07/12/2020 and 21/09/2021. Adjusted VE (aVE) decreased from 81% (95% CI 68%-89%) 14-73 days after dose-2 to 46% (95% CI 22%-63%) >6-months; with no significant difference for short-interval BNT162b2 but significantly lower aVE (50% (95% CI 18%-70%) 14-73 days after dose-2 from ChAdOx1. Protection from infection-acquired immunity showed evidence of waning in unvaccinated follow-up but remained consistently over 90% in those who received two doses of vaccine, even in those infected over 15-months ago. Conclusion Two doses of BNT162b2 vaccination induce high short-term protection to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which wanes significantly after six months. Infection-acquired immunity boosted with vaccination remains high over a year after infection. Boosters will be essential to maintain protection in vaccinees who have not had primary infection to reduce infection and transmission in this population.

N2  - Background: Hemodialysis (HD) patients are at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and its severe complications compared to the general population. Several studies examined the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in this highly vulnerable population but showed mixed results. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in HD patients in the State of Qatar. Methods: We used a test-negative case-control design to determine the effectiveness of vaccination in HD patients > 14 days after the second dose. Ninetyfive patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR (cases), while 884 patients had negative PCR (controls). Vaccine effectiveness was determined using the following formula [Vaccine effectiveness = 1 - Odds (T+ |vaccinated) /Odds (T+|non-vaccinated)]. Results: Thirty out of 691 vaccinated HD patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR versus 65 out of 288 non-vaccinated patients (4% vs. 23%, P<0.0001). Patients were more likely to have positive PCR if they were females (P<0.0001), elderly (P=0.02), or Asians (P=0.03). The overall effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines against confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was 84.5% (95% CI: 76.5-89.8; Table 1) Conclusions: Our data support the importance of using the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in HD patients to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in such a high-risk population.

N2  - The prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is high in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Dosing of Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) for thromboprophylaxis in patients with severe COVID-19 is subject to ongoing debate. In this brief report, we describe our study where we retrospectively examined the efficacy of standard- versus intermediate-dosing of enoxaparin in attaining and maintaining accepted prophylactic levels of anti-Factor Xa (anti-FXa) in critically ill patients with COVID-19. We collected data for all patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were treated with enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis in a single Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in the United Kingdom between 31st March and 16th November 2020. Standard-dose of enoxaparin was 40 mg subcutaneously once daily for patients with normal renal function and body weight between 50 and 100 kg; the intermediate-dose was 40 mg subcutaneously twice daily. Anti-FXa peak concentrations between 0.2-0.4 IU/ml were considered appropriate for thromboprophylaxis. Age, sex, weight, Body Mass Index, APACHE II score, ICU length of stay, initial P/F ratio and creatinine were not statistically significantly different between standard- and intermediate-dose thromboprophylaxis cohorts. In the standard-dose group, the median initial anti-FXa level was 0.13 (interquartile range 0.06-0.18) compared to 0.26 (0.21-0.33) in the intermediate-dose cohort (p < 0.001). On repeated measurement, in the standard dose cohort, 44 of 95 (46%) anti-FXa levels were < 0.2 IU/ml compared with 24 of 132 (18%) levels in the intermediate-dose cohort even after dose-adjustment. There was one radiologically confirmed pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography pulmonary angiogram during hospital admission in each cohort. Our study supports starting intermediate-dose thromboprophylaxis for critically ill patients with COVID-19 to achieve anti-FXa levels in the accepted thromboprophylactic range although further study is required to investigate whether anti-FXa guided thromboprophylaxis is safe and effective in reducing the incidence of VTEs in critically ill patients with COVID-19.

N2  - In this brief communication we are showing original research results with early estimates from Danish nationwide databases of vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the novel SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) up to five months after a primary vaccination series with the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines. Our study provides evidence of protection against infection with the Omicron variant after completion of a primary vaccination series with the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines; in particular, we found a VE against the Omicron variant of 55.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 23.5 to 73.7%) and 36.7% (95% CI: -69.9 to 76.4%) for the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines, respectively, in the first month after primary vaccination. However, the VE is significantly lower than that against Delta infection and declines rapidly over just a few months. The VE is re-established upon revaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine (54.6%, 95% CI: 30.4 to 70.4%).

N2  - Pneumonia associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been accounted for high mortality rate in severe COVID-19 worldwide, and additional serious scarcity of standard and effective anti-inflammatory drug in COVID-19 pneumonia management is a big challenge. Baricitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, is a promising drug in COVID-19 pneumonia. This study aims to compare the clinical outcome of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with baricitinib with or without a loading dose. This prospective case-control study enrolled 37 adult patients where 17 patients (control) received baricitinib at 4 mg oral daily dose and 20 patients (case) received an additional single 8 mg oral loading dose. The median day to gain blood oxygen saturation level ≥95% (in room air) and return in normal breathing function were lower in case group than the control group. The requirement of intensive care unit and mechanical ventilation support was higher in the control group than in the case group [29.4% (N = 17)/10% (N = 20), P < 0.05; 11.8% (N = 17)/5% (N = 20), P > 0.05), respectively]. Thus, an additional loading dose of baricitinib revealed better clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

N2  - Importance Circadian rhythms affect fundamental immune processes, but how this translates to clinical outcomes like real-world vaccine effectiveness is unclear. Objective To examine associations between Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination timing and effectiveness. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort study of database records from Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), a major Israeli Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). We included all individuals over 12 with at least one timestamped vaccine dose and no documented COVID-19 infection prior to completing the initial 2-dose immunization series (n=1,515,754, 99.2% receiving BNT162b2). Database records spanned December 19, 2020, to April 25, 2022, encompassing two spikes in COVID infection dominated by the delta (B.1.617.2) and omicron (B.1.1.529) SARS-CoV-2 variants. Main Outcomes and Measures Outcomes included COVID-19 breakthrough infection and COVID-19 associated emergency department (ED) visits. Our main comparison was between patients vaccinated exclusively during morning hours (8:00-11:59), afternoon (12:00-15:59), or evening hours (16:00-19:59). We employed Cox multivariate regression to adjust for differences in age, sex, and co-morbidities. Results. Breakthrough infections differed based on vaccination time, with lowest rates associated with late morning to early afternoon, and highest rates with evening vaccination. Vaccination timing remained significant after adjustment for patient age, sex, and co-morbidities (HR=0.88 afternoon vs. evening, [95% CI 0.87-0.90]). Results were consistent in patients who received the basic two-dose vaccine series and who received booster doses. The relationship between COVID-19 immunization time and breakthrough infection risk was sinusoidal, consistent with a biological rhythm in vaccine effectiveness. Vaccination timing altered breakthrough infection risk by 8.6-25% in our cohort, depending on patient age and dose number. The benefits of daytime vaccination were concentrated in younger and elderly patients. In contrast to breakthrough infections, COVID-19 related ED visits correlated with age and medical comorbidities but not with time of vaccination. Conclusions and Relevance We report a significant association between the time of COVID-19 vaccination and its clinical effectiveness in terms of breakthrough infection. These data have implications for mass vaccination programs.

N2  - SARS-CoV-2 variants have continuously emerged even as highly effective vaccines have been widely deployed. Reduced neutralization observed against variants of concern (VOC) raises the question as to whether other antiviral antibody activities are similarly compromised, or if they might compensate for lost neutralization activity. In this study, the breadth and potency of antibody recognition and effector function was surveyed in both healthy individuals as well as immunologically vulnerable subjects following either natural infection or receipt of an mRNA vaccine. Considering pregnant women as a model cohort with higher risk of severe illness and death, we observed similar binding and functional breadth for healthy and immunologically vulnerable populations. In contrast, considerably greater functional antibody breadth and potency across VOC was associated with vaccination than prior infection. However, greater antibody functional activity targeting the endemic coronavirus OC43 was noted among convalescent individuals, illustrating a dichotomy in recognition between close and distant human coronavirus strains that was associated with exposure history. Probing the full-length spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) revealed that antibody-mediated Fc effector functions were better maintained against full-length spike as compared to RBD. This analysis of antibody functions in healthy and vulnerable populations across a panel of SARS-CoV-2 VOC and extending through endemic alphacoronavirus strains suggests the differential potential for antibody effector functions to contribute to protecting vaccinated and convalescent subjects as the pandemic progresses and novel variants continue to evolve.

N2  - Background Symptoms after COVID-19 infection affect the quality of life of its survivor especially to the special senses including olfactory function. It is important to prevent the disability at an earlier stage. Vaccination as key prevention has been proven to be effective in reducing symptomatic disease and severity. However, the effects of vaccination on post COVID symptoms have not been evaluated. This study aimed to evaluate the possible protection of full vaccination and the occurrence of post-COVID olfactory dysfunction, specifically anosmia and hyposmia in patients who were diagnosed with COVID19. Method A longitudinal analysis using the retrospective cohort of the Indonesian patient-based Post-COVID survey collected from July 2021 until December 2021, involving COVID-19 Patients confirmed by RT-PCR and/or Antigen test. Variables including demography, comorbidities, health behavior, type of vaccine, symptoms, and treatment were collected through an online questionnaire based on the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS). Participants were matched (1:1) using propensity matching score into two exposure statuses, infected 1)>14 days of full vaccination and 2)<14 days or incomplete or unvaccinated. The olfactory dysfunction was assessed two weeks and four weeks after negative conversion with PCR using a self-measured olfactory questionnaire (MOQ). The Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) was performed to assess the effect of full vaccination on post-COVID olfactory dysfunction. The Receiver Operating Characteristic determined the sensitivity and specificity of the cutoff value of the days from fully vaccinated to diagnosis and the olfactory dysfunction. Results A total of 442 participants were extracted from the cohort and inoculated with the inactivated viral vaccine (99.5%). The prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in two weeks was 9.95% and 5.43% after four weeks. Adjusted by other variables, people who were infected >14 days after being fully vaccinated had a 69% (adjusted OR 0.31 95% CI 0.102-0.941) probability of developing olfactory dysfunction. Longer days of fully vaccinated to infection associated with increased risk (adjusted OR 1.012 95% CI 1.002-1.022 p-value 0.015). A cut-off of 88 days of full vaccination-to-diagnosis duration has Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.693 (p=0.002), the sensitivity of 73.9%, and specificity of 63.3% in differentiating the olfactory dysfunction event in two weeks after COVID with a crude odds ratio of 4.852 (95% CI 1.831-12.855 p=0.001) Conclusion After 14 days of full vaccination, the protective effect could reduce the chance of post-COVID olfactory dysfunction although a longer full vaccination-to-diagnosis duration increases the risk. It is important to consider a booster shot starting from 89 days after the last dose in those who received the inactivated viral regimen.

N2  - Objectives: Intermittent fasting boosts some mechanisms of host defense against infection while modulating the inflammatory response. Lower-frequency periodic fasting is associated with greater survival and lower risk of comorbidities that exacerbate COVID-19. This study evaluated the association of periodic fasting with COVID-19 severity and, secondarily, initial diagnosis of infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Design: Prospective longitudinal observational cohort study. Setting: Single-center secondary care facility in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA with follow-up across a 24-hospital integrated healthcare system. Participants: Patients enrolled in the INSPIRE registry in 2013-2020 were studied if they had SARS-CoV-2 testing in March 2020-February 2021 and either tested positive (N=205) for the primary outcome evaluation or had a positive or negative test result for evaluation of the secondary outcome (n=1,524). Interventions: No treatment assignments were made; individuals provided information about their personal practice and history of engaging in routine periodic fasting across their lifespan. Main outcome measures: The association of periodic fasting with a composite of mortality or hospitalization as the primary outcome was evaluated by Cox regression through February 2021 and multivariable adjustments considered 36 covariables in INSPIRE patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Secondary analysis evaluated the association of fasting with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in INSPIRE patients evaluated for COVID-19 (n=1,524). Results: Subjects engaging in periodic fasting (n=73, 35.6%) did so for 40.4±20.6 years (max: 81.9 years) prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. The composite outcome occurred in 11.0% of periodic fasters and 28.8% of non-fasters (p=0.013), with HR=0.61 (95% CI=0.42, 0.90) favoring fasting. Multivariable analyses confirmed this association. Other predictors of hospitalization/mortality were age, Hispanic ethnicity, prior MI, prior TIA, and renal failure, with trends for race, smoking, hyperlipidemia, coronary disease, diabetes, heart failure, and history of anxiety, but not alcohol use. In secondary analysis, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 14.3% of fasters and 13.0% of non-fasters (p=0.51). Conclusions: Routine periodic fasting was associated with a lower risk of hospitalization or mortality in patients with COVID-19. Fasting may be a complementary therapy to vaccination that could provide immune support and hyperinflammation control during and beyond the pandemic.

N2  - Background The rate at which COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness wanes over time is crucial for vaccination policies, but is incompletely understood with conflicting results from different studies. Methods This cohort study, using the OpenSAFELY-TPP database and approved by NHS England, included individuals without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection assigned to vaccines priority groups 2-12 defined by the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. We compared individuals who had received two doses of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 with unvaccinated individuals during six 4-week comparison periods, separately for subgroups aged 65+ years; 16-64 years and clinically vulnerable; 40-64 years and 18-39 years. We used Cox regression, stratified by first dose eligibility and geographical region and controlled for calendar time, to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing vaccinated with unvaccinated individuals, and quantified waning vaccine effectiveness as ratios of aHRs per-4-week period. The outcomes were COVID-19 hospitalisation, COVID-19 death, positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and non-COVID-19 death. Findings The BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 and unvaccinated groups comprised 1,773,970, 2,961,011 and 2,433,988 individuals, respectively. Waning of vaccine effectiveness was similar across outcomes and vaccine brands: e.g. in the 65+ years subgroup ratios of aHRs versus unvaccinated for COVID-19 hospitalisation, COVID-19 death and positive SARS-CoV-2 test ranged from 1.23 (95% CI 1.15-1.32) to 1.27 (1.20-1.34) for BNT162b2 and 1.16 (0.98-1.37) to 1.20 (1.14-1.27) for ChAdOx1. Despite waning, rates of COVID-19 hospitalisation and COVID-19 death were substantially lower among vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals up to 26 weeks after second dose, with estimated aHRs <0.20 (>80% vaccine effectiveness) for BNT162b2, and <0.26 (>74%) for ChAdOx1. By weeks 23-26, rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated individuals were similar to or higher than those in unvaccinated individuals: aHRs ranged from 0.85 (0.78-0.92) to 1.53 (1.07-2.18) for BNT162b2, and 1.21 (1.13-1.30) to 1.99 (1.94-2.05) for ChAdOx1. Interpretation The rate at which estimated vaccine effectiveness waned was strikingly consistent for COVID-19 hospitalisation, COVID-19 death and positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and similar across subgroups defined by age and clinical vulnerability. If sustained to outcomes of infection with the Omicron variant and to booster vaccination, these findings will facilitate scheduling of booster vaccination doses.

N2  - Background: The effectiveness of a 3rd mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (“booster”) dose against the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant is uncertain especially in older, high-risk populations. Objective: To determine mRNA booster vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization and death in the omicron era by type of booster, type of primary vaccine, time since primary vaccine, age and comorbidity burden. Design: Target trial emulation study comparing booster vaccination versus no booster. Setting: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system Participants and Intervention: Among persons who had received two mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses at least 5 months earlier, we designed this retrospective matched cohort study to emulate a target trial of booster mRNA vaccination (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) versus no booster, conducted from 12/01/2021 to 03/31/2022. Measurements: Booster VE. Results: Each group included 490,838 well-matched persons, predominantly male (88%), mean age 63.0±14.0 years, followed for up to 121 days (mean 79.8 days). Booster VE >10 days after booster was 42.3% (95% CI 40.6-43.9) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 53.3% (48.1-58.0) against SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization and 79.1% (71.2-84.9) against SARSCoV-2-related death. Booster VE was similar for different booster types (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273), age groups or primary vaccination regimens, but was significantly higher with longer time since primary vaccination and with higher comorbidity burden. Limitations: Predominantly male population. Conclusions: Booster mRNA vaccination was highly effective in preventing death and moderately effective in preventing infection and hospitalization for up to 4 months after administration in the omicron era. Increased uptake of booster vaccination, which is currently suboptimal, should be pursued to limit the morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in persons with high comorbidity burden.

N2  - Objective: The national COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in India, prioritized healthcare workers to be vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222). So, we aimed to ascertain the effectiveness of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine among the healthcare workers by characterizing the breakthrough infections which occurred 14 days after the second dose of the vaccine. Methods: We prospectively evaluated the ‘Institutional Covid Vaccination Database’ to categorize the SARS-CoV-2 positive healthcare workers into 2 cohorts: infected vaccinated and infected unvaccinated cohort. Along with comparing the descriptive statistics of the cohorts, the relative risk (RR), relative risk reduction (RRR), and the vaccine effectiveness were calculated. The study population was compared for the significant difference by using the parametric model (binary logistic regression) for the Odds ratio and the non-parametric model (cox proportionality model) for the Hazard ratio. Results: Out of the 324 healthcare workers employed in our institution 243 (75%) were vaccinated. When 6.58% (16) of the vaccinated healthcare workers were tested positive, 43.75% (35) were infected in the unvaccinated cohort and the median time of infection in the vaccinated cohort was 65 days (range 20 -91 days). While the cox proportionality model reveals that the age, sex, and the contact exposure status of the cohort are not significant factors for getting infected after being vaccinated, binary logistic regression proves that a significant relationship exists between the incidence of infection and the unvaccinated status (p = 0.001, OR = 4.278). Completing the two-dose of vaccination decreased the hazard of testing positive for the SARS-CoV-2 by 84.96 % when compared with the unvaccinated individuals, which is the effectiveness of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Conclusion: There is an increased risk of the third wave of COVID-19 infection in the upcoming months. So, primary infection control measures should be followed even if vaccinated, to prevent the risk of breakthrough infections.

N2  - (1) Objectives: Patients with COVID-19 infection have been given various formulations and dosages of steroids over the last year and a half. This study aims to compare the effects of different formulations and doses of steroids on the 30 day in-hospital clinical outcome of patients with severe COVID-19 infection. (2) Material and Methods: An analysis of a retrospective cohort was carried out on patients with severe COVID-19 infection in a high-dependency unit (HDU) between February and July 2021. In total, 557 patients were included in this study. Patients who did not receive steroids (124) were excluded. Patients were divided into three groups based on dosages of steroids (Dexamethasone = 6 mg/day, Dexamethasone > 6 mg/day, and Methylprednisolone = 500 mg/day), given for 10 days. First, clinical outcome was evaluated on the 10th day of steroid administration in relation to mode of oxygen delivery. Then, Kaplan–Meier analysis was employed to determine 30 day in-hospital survival in relation to the use of steroid. (3) Results: Three groups were statistically equal according to biochemical characteristics. After 10 days of Methylprednisolone = 500 mg/day vs. Dexamethasone = 6 mg/day, 10.9% vs. 6.2% of patients required invasive ventilation (p = 0.01). The 30 day in-hospital mortality was lowest, 3%, in individuals receiving Dexamethasone = 6 mg/day, compared to 3.9% in individuals receiving Dexamethasone > 6 mg/day and 9.9% in individuals receiving Methylprednisolone = 500 mg/day, respectively. The median elapsed time was longer than 28 days between admission and outcome for Dexamethasone = 6 mg/day, compared to 18 days for Dexamethasone > 6 mg/day and 17 days for Methylprednisolone = 500 mg/day (p = < 0.0001). Dexamethasone = 6 mg/day was found to be a positive predictor of clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients on regression analysis. (4) Conclusions: Low-dose Dexamethasone (6 mg/day) is more effective than high-dose Dexamethasone and Methylprednisolone in improving the survival outcome of severe COVID-19 cases.

N2  - Using a prospective national cohort of 3.75 million individuals aged 20 or older, we evaluated the effectiveness against COVID-19 related ICU admissions and death of mRNA-based second vaccine boosters for four different three-dose background regimes: BNT162b2 primary series plus a homologous booster, and CoronaVac primary series plus an mRNA booster, a homologous booster, and a ChAdOx-1 booster. We estimated the vaccine effectiveness weekly from February 14 to August 15, 2022, by estimating hazard ratios of immunization over non-vaccination, accounting for relevant confounders. The overall adjusted effectiveness of a second mRNA booster shot was 88.2% (95%CI, 86.2-89.9) and 90.5% (95%CI 89.4-91.4) against ICU admissions and death, respectively. Vaccine effectiveness showed a mild decrease for all regimens and outcomes, probably associated with the introduction of BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sub-lineages and immunity waning. The duration of effectiveness suggests that no additional boosters are needed six months following a second booster shot.

N2  - Background: An impaired humoral and cellular immunogenicity to the mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has been reported in patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies. Data regarding the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on COVID-19 evolution an immunocompromised population are still scarce. Aims: To compare disease severity and mortality in a real-life cohort according to the vaccination status of patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies developing COVID-19 disease. Methods: We retrospectively collected clinical data from the patients with a current or prior history of hematologic malignancy in the last 5 years at Vall d'Hebron Hospital whom suffered a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were unvaccinated between March 2020 and May 2021, and partially or completely vaccinated between May 2021 and January 2022. The primary endpoint was COVID-related mortality according to vaccination status. Secondary endpoints included rate and length of Hospitalization, ICU admission, need for supplemental oxygen including high flow oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation, and severity of COVID-19 disease. Results: Overall, 113 vaccinated and 81 unvaccinated patients developed COVID-19. Both groups were similar in age (median 69 and 72 years, respectively), gender predominance, diagnosis (mainly lymphoproliferative diseases [58% and 53%]), and administered active treatment (mostly anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies [38% and 37%]). In contrast, more patients received active treatment (78% vs. 48%; p=<0.001) in the vaccinated cohort. Vaccinated patients developed infection by the delta variant in 27% (17/62) and by the omicron variant in 73% of the sequenced cases (45/62). Genotype analysis of the variant in unvaccinated cases is ongoing. Despite the fact that 96% of patients received 2 vaccine doses and 73% also a third boost dose, in only 67% (59/88) of patients basal IgG anti-spike antibodies were detected after vaccination. In comparison with the unvaccinated cohort of patients, vaccinated patients had less severe (17% vs. 42%; p=0.01) and critical (13% vs 28%; p=0.03) COVID-19 infection, lower rates of Hospitalization (42% vs. 90%; p=<0.001) with shorter length of stay (median 13 days (IQR 7-34) vs. 11 days (IQR 6-16), and fewer patients needed supplemental oxygen (34% vs. 73%; p=0). Admission rates to ICU were similar between both cohorts. Finally, mortality rate was lower in the vaccinated patients in comparison with the unvaccinated cohort (HR: 0.19 (95%CI 0.09, 0.38); p= <0.001). Of note, in Hospitalized patients only, the mortality of the vaccinated cohort was also lower (HR: 0.38 (95%CI 0.19, 0.76); p=0.007). Among vaccinated patients who suffered a severe/critical infection, 52% did not have vaccine seroconversion. Of the vaccinated patients who died (11/113), 6/8 had negative anti-S IgG, 5/9 were infected by the delta variant and 4/9 by omicron, and 10/11 were on active treatment (5/11 with monoclonal antibodies). (Figure Presented ) Summary/Conclusion: In our series, despite the heterogeneity of infection by different viral variants and treatment availability for COVID- 19 during the evolution of the pandemic, vaccination has been widely effective at reducing need of Hospitalization, severity and mortality of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in hematological patients. Nevertheless, a subgroup of vaccinated patients remains with an adverse outcome and requires further identification and management improvement.

N2  - Background: Cirrhosis is associated with vaccine hyporesponsiveness to several commonly used vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines. The effectiveness of vaccination against COVID-19 variants in participants with cirrhosis is unknown. We aimed to study the association between the community prevalence of the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variants and the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines, in participants with cirrhosis. Methods: We performed a test-negative case-control study of patients with cirrhosis who had a SARS COV2 PCR test between February 1, 2021 and January 21, 2022. Participants were considered fully vaccinated 14 days after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine. We also captured participants who received a booster dose of the mRNA vaccine. We excluded liver transplant recipients, those partially vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine, participants with a positive SARS-Co- V- 2 PCR prior to the study period, and those who received the Ad.26.COV2.S vaccine. Association of community prevalence of variants and effectiveness against varying severities of COVID-19 was studied, adjusting for time from vaccination, and receipt of third dose. Outcomes included symptomatic, at least moderate, severe/ critical COVID-19, and COVID-19- related death. Results: Vaccine effectiveness was associated with the community prevalence of variants, the outcome of interest, days from full vaccination, and receipt of the third dose. Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 after 2 months of vaccination was 82% during Alpha (aOR 0.18, 95% CI 0.10-0.32, p<0.0001), 68% during Delta (aOR 0.32, 95% CI 0.23-0.44, p<0.0001), and 0% in the Omicron period (aOR 0.70, 95% CI 0.37-1.35, p=0.29). Vaccine effectiveness 2 months after vaccination against severe/ critical COVID-19 was similar across variant periods- 72% during Alpha (aOR 0.28, 95% CI 0.11-0.72, p=0.01), 75% during Delta (aOR 0.25, 95% CI 0.14-0.43, p<0.0001), and 84% during Omicron (aOR 0.16, 95% CI 0.06-0.46, p=0.001). Vaccine effectiveness decreased with increasing time from vaccination (p-value for interaction<0.0001). Receipt of a third dose was associated with a reduced odds of severe/critical COVID-19 (aOR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32-0.92, p=0.02). Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccination was highly effective against symptomatic COVID-19 during Alpha, and lowest during the Omicron period. Effectiveness against severe/ critical COVID-19 was highest during Omicron, and lowest during the Delta period. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Background: Cirrhosis is associated with immune dysregulation and hypo-responsiveness to several vaccines including against COVID-19. Although a third dose of an mRNA vaccine is now recommended for the adult general population in the United States, there is limited data about the additional benefit of a third dose of an mRNA vaccine, compared to two doses alone, for patients with cirrhosis. Our aim was to study the association of the receipt of three doses of either the Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA or Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccines in patients with cirrhosis compared to a propensity-matched control group of patients at similar risk of infection, who received two doses. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with cirrhosis who received two or three doses of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine located throughout the United States. Participants who received three doses of the vaccine (n=13,041) were propensity matched with 13,041 controls who received two doses, and studied between July 18, 2021 and February 11, 2022 when the B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron) were the predominant variants. By assigning a date of the third dose to each matched participant in the two-dose arm, and including date of the second dose and patient location in the matching, the study was able to balance the exposure of participants in the two arms to similar variants. Outcomes were aggregated as all cases with COVID-19, symptomatic COVD-19, with at least moderate COVID-19, or severe or critical COVID-19. Results: Receipt of the third dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was associated with an 80.7% reduction COVID-19 (95% CI 39.2-89.1, p<0.001), 80.4% reduction in symptomatic COVID-19, 80% reduction in moderate/ severe or critical COVID-19, (95% CI 34.5-87.6%, p=0.005), 100% reduction in severe or critical COVID-19 (95% CI 99.2-100.0, p=0.01), and a 100% reduction in COVID-19- related death (95% CI 99.8-100.0, p=0.007), compared to recipients with cirrhosis who received two doses. The magnitude of reduction in COVID-19 was greater with the third dose of the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine than the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine, and in participants with compensated than decompensated cirrhosis. Conclusion: The receipt of the third dose of an mRNA vaccine is associated with an 80% decrease in the development of COVID-19, symptomatic COVID-19, and moderate/severe or critical COVID-19, and a 100% reduction in severe or critical COVID-19 and COVID-19 related death, compared to participants with cirrhosis who received only two doses. The reduction in COVID-19 related outcomes with the third dose is greater than that described in the general population, suggesting that a third dose is able to overcome the vaccine hyporesponsiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in cirrhosis.

N2  - Background and Aims: Immunity to Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be either infection-induced or vaccine-induced. The duration of protective immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection and how this compares with that from vaccination is presently unclear. Cirrhosis is associated with vaccine hyporesponsiveness to several vaccines include COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. The objective of our study was to compare infection-induced and vaccine-induced immunity against COVID-19 among patients with cirrhosis. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study among patients with cirrhosis. Vaccine-induced immunity group was defined as participants with cirrhosis who were fully vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine and received the first dose of the mRNA vaccine between 12/18/2020 and 4/1/2021. Infection-induced immunity was defined as participants who had their first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR in the same study period. The outcome was a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR more than 60 days after previous infection or vaccination. Patients were followed until the outcome, death or the end of the study period (11/16/21). COVID-19 cases were classified based on individual chart review using the National Institute of Health (NIH) COVID-19 severity scale as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe or critical illness. The two groups were matched 1:3 using propensity score (PS) matching, with PS scores calculated based on variables associated with COVID-19 severity, including for the date of infection or first dose of vaccnation, and location, to account for variants. Cox proportional hazards models were fit from the immunity generating event to outcome (SARS-CoV-2PCR). Logistic regression models were also fit for the outcome (positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR) after the immunity generating event. Results: There were 443 participants in the infection-induced group, that were PS matched with 1,329 participants in the vaccine-induced group. The two groups were well matched after PS matching. On multivariable Cox hazard model, vaccine-induced immunity was associated with a 75% reduction in COVID-19 compared to infection-induced immunity (adjusted Hazard Ratio 0.25, 95% CI 0.15-0.43, p<0.0001). On multinomial logistic regression analysis, vaccine-induced immunity was associated with a 80% reduction in asymptomatic (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 0.20, 95% CI 0.09-0.47, p-0.0002), 64% reduction in mild (aOR 0.36, 95% CI 0.13-0.97, p=0.048), and 79% reduction in severe or critical COVID-19 (aOR 0.21,95% CI 0.06-0.74, p=0.02) compared to infection-induced immunity. There were no observed differences between the two groups for moderate COVID-19 (aOR 0.31, 95% CI 0.06-1.56, p=0.16). Conclusions: In participants with cirrhosis, vaccine-induced immunity is associated with a significantly greater protection against COVID-19 compared to infection-induced immunity.[Figure Presented]

N2  - Background: This study was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of partial and full vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (COVISHIELD) to prevent the development of moderate or severe illness among COVID-positive cases. Methods: This prospective cohort study was conducted among Armed Forces personnel deployed in Northern India who were found COVID positive during the study period between January and June 2021. Information about the vaccination status, age and comorbidities was collected at the time of diagnosis. Classification of COVID cases as moderate or severe was performed as per criteria given by the Government of India. Individuals were considered partially vaccinated three weeks after one dose and fully vaccinated two weeks after the second dose. Risk ratio and vaccine effectiveness (VE) to prevent moderate or severe disease among COVID cases were calculated. Results: A total of 2005 COVID-19 patients were included in our study. Partial vaccination and full vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 offered 13% (95% credible interval (CI): −56.8%, 52.8%) and 66.6% (95% CI: 34.9%, 84.6%) protection against progression to moderate/severe illness among COVID-positive individuals. The risk of moderate-severe disease among COVID-positive cases occurring 4–11 weeks after the first dose was also lesser among those who had taken the second dose of vaccine than individuals who have been vaccinated with only one dose. Conclusion: Interval between the first and second doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine should be reduced to 4–6 weeks, as partial vaccination offers lower protection against the development of moderate-severe illness after COVID infection.

N2  - Rationale: The 2019 Novel Coronavirus has presented a unique set of challenges in management, especially in cases involving the development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). While several therapies have been posited as beneficial in improving outcomes for patients affected by SARS-cov-2, also known as COVID-19, few therapies have consistently shown benefits as corticosteroids have. However, the dosage and timing of steroid use has not been well studied. The RECOVERY trial identified reduced mortality with low dose decadron at a dose of 6mg daily, with greater benefits in critically ill respiratory failure patients. However, predating the emergence of COVID-19, Meduri et al identified high dose steroids (defined as at least 1mg/kg methylprednisolone or an equivalent dose of alternative steroid) as beneficial in patients with ARDS of all causes. We present a retrospective study aimed at investigating the use of high dose steroids in critically ill patients with respiratory failure from COVID-19 induced ARDS. Methods: We analyzed a retrospective cohort of 211 patients with respiratory failure from covid-induced ARDS requiring ICU admission to a community teaching hospital, who received low dose steroid or high dose steroid between March 1, 2020 to March 30, 2021. The primary end-point was mortality at 30 days. Secondary end points included number of mechanical ventilation days, ICU length of stay (LOS) days, and superimposed infections. Results: 30 day mortality rate was 46.6% in the low dose steroid and 49.5% in the high dose steroid group, (p=0.785). There was no difference in mortality between the two groups even after multivariable logistic regression to adjust for confounding variables, including gender, age, BMI, history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and shock (OR 1.2, CI 0.55-2.63, p=0.639). High dose steroid was associated with longer median ICU LOS (low dose=10 days, high dose=16 days, p=0.0001), longer ventilator days (low dose=5 days, high dose=10 days, p=0.034) and higher risk for superimposed fungal infections (low dose=5.1%, high dose=16.1%, p=0.015). More patients in the high dose group had moderate/severe ARDS compared to low dose group (low dose=77.9%, high dose=94.6%, p=0.003). Conclusion: In patients hospitalized with ARDS secondary to COVID-19, the use of high dose steroids did not improve 30-day mortality and can increase ICU LOS, mechanical ventilation days and rate of fungal infection.

N2  - Importance: Disentangling the effects of different SARS-CoV-2 variants and of vaccination on the occurrence of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) is crucial to estimate and potentially reduce the future burden of PASC. Objective: To determine the association of primary SARS-CoV-2 infection on the frequency of PASC symptoms by viral variant and vaccination status. Design: Cross-sectional questionnaire and SARS-CoV-2 serology (May/June 2022) performed within a prospective healthcare worker cohort (SURPRISE study). Setting: Multicenter study in nine healthcare networks from North-Eastern Switzerland. Participants: Volunteer sample of healthcare workers (HCW) from participating institutions. Of approximately 20’000 eligible participants, 3’870 registered for the cohort and 2’912 were included in this analysis. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection documented by positive nasopharyngeal swab (>4 weeks ago), stratified by viral variant and vaccination status at time of infection, compared to absence of documented infection (no positive swab, negative serology). Main Outcome: Sum score of eighteen self-reported PASC symptoms. Results: Among 2’912 participants (median age 44 years, 81.3% female), SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported by 1’685 (55.9%) participants, thereof 315 (18.7%) during Wild-type, 288 (17.1%) during Alpha/Delta, and 1’082 (64.2%) during Omicron circulation. Mean symptom number in previously infected participants significantly exceeded that of uninfected controls (0.39), but decreased with recency of the viral variant: 1.12 (p<0.001) for Wild-type (median time since infection 18.5 months), 0.67 (p<0.001) for Alpha/Delta (6.6 months), and 0.52 (p=0.005) for Omicron BA.1 (3.1 months) infected participants. After Omicron BA.1 infection, the mean symptom score was 0.49 (p=0.30) for those with ≥3 prior vaccinations and 0.71 (p=0.028) with 1-2 previous vaccinations compared to 0.36 for unvaccinated individuals. Adjusting for confounders, Wild-type (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 2.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.08-3.83) and Alpha/Delta infection (aRR 1.93, 95% CI 1.10-3.46) showed significant associations with the outcome, whereas Omicron BA.1 infection (aRR 1.29, 95% CI 0.69–2.43) and vaccination before infection (aRR 1.27, 95% CI 0.82–1.94) did not. Conclusions and Relevance: Previous infection with pre-Omicron variants was the strongest risk factor for reporting PASC symptoms in this HCW cohort. A definite influence of prior vaccination on the prevention of PASC after Omicron BA.1 infection was not measurable.

N2  - Objective: To assess the effectiveness of high-dose corticosteroid pulse therapy and evaluate possible factors associated with 28-day mortality in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: We conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study on hospitalised patients with clinical, epidemiological, and/or radiologically confirmed and suspected COVID-19 at Bitlis Tatvan State Hospital in Turkey between December 1, 2020 and June 1, 2021. All data of the study participants were recorded, and all patients received intravenous high-dose corticosteroid pulse therapy. The Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI), Charlson Comorbidity Index and Total Severity Score were calculated. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were performed to evaluate the clinical and laboratory parameters that may affect the 28-day mortality. Results: A total of 126 patients were included in the analysis. The 28-day mortality rate of the patients was 22.2%. Laboratory and clinical improvement were observed in 77.8% (98/126) of patients after high-dose corticosteroid pulse therapy. There was a statistically significant difference between the survivors and non-survivors in terms of age, platelet count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and OSCI, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and Total Severity Score (P<0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that age [HR 1.047 (95% CI 1.01-1.08)], use of prophylactic anticoagulation [HR 0.838 (95% CI 0.79-0.89)], and bacterial co-infection [HR 3.966 (95% CI 1.40-11.21)] were significant determinants of mortality. Early C-reactive protein (CRP) response, decreased oxygen requirement, and improving respiratory rate/OSCI scores after administration of high-dose corticosteroid pulse therapy could contribute to clinical improvement. Conclusions: CRP response, needed oxygen and OSCI scores can be used as prognostic factors to select patients who will benefit from high-dose corticosteroid pulse therapy.

N2  - Background: There is paucity of real-world data on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness and safety from cohort designs. The current study aimed to evaluate vaccine performance during second wave in India. It also aimed to determine adverse events of significant concern (AESCs), and to ascertain the effect of vaccination on persistent health issues in individuals post COVID-19. Methods: A cohort study was conducted from July-2021 to December-2021 in a tertiary hospital of north India. The primary outcome was vaccine-effectiveness against COVID-19. Secondary outcomes were AESCs, and persistent health issues in those receiving vaccine. Regression analyses were performed to determine risk factors. Results: In 2760 healthcare workers (HCWs) included, 1033 COVID-19 events were reported. Around 6-17% vaccine effectiveness was observed against COVID-19 occurrence. One dose-recipients were at 1.6-times increased risk of COVID-19. Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was a strong independent protective factor against COVID-19 (aOR 0.66). Full vaccination reduced moderate-severe COVID-19 by 57%. Those with lung disease were at 2.5-times increased risk of moderate-severe COVID-19. AESCs were observed in 1.3% including one case each of myocarditis and severe hypersensitivity. Individuals with hypothyroidism were at 5-times and those receiving vaccine after recovery from COVID-19 were at 3-times higher risk of persistent health issues. Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccination reduced COVID-19 severity but offered marginal protection against occurrence. Relationship of asthma and hypothyroidism with COVID-19 outcomes necessitates focused research. Independent protection of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was high and persistent health issues were common in individuals receiving vaccine post COVID-19. Recommendations of vaccinating those recovered from COVID-19 need further studies.

N2  - Background and aims: There is poor antibody response in up to 61% of the liver transplant patients after mRNACOVID-19 vaccination, and almost 20% of liver transplant recipients have undetectable antibody levels. However, antibodies are surrogate markers of disease protection and absence of seroconversion does not mean complete susceptibility to the disease. We hypothesized that COVID-19 vaccines are effective in liver transplant patients despite low seroconversion rates. Method:We designed a test-negative case-control study to assess the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of COVID-19 vaccination in liver transplant recipients followed at our center in Hamad Medical Corporation. All liver transplant patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1st of February till 30th of July in Qatar were included in the study. Case patients were identified as patients who had positive SARS-CoV-2 test on nasopharyngeal and throat swab while control patients were identified as patients whowere tested negative during the same period. Information regarding demographic and clinical characteristics, transplant history, current immunosuppressive treatment was obtained from the medical records. Also, we recorded the type of COVID-19 vaccination, number of vaccine doses (one or two), COVID-19 complications, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions. VE was estimated by a test-negative case-control design in which symptomatic liver transplant patients who were tested negative for COVID-19 were recorded as controls, while patients who tested positive were considered cases. VE was defined as “1- OR (odds ratio).” Results: A total of 136 liver transplant patients were included in the study. 13 (9.6%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period, out of which 7 (5.2%) needed hospitalization and 5 (3.7%) were admitted to the ICU. None of the patients died. The baseline characteristics, transplant history, comorbid conditions, and current immunosuppressive treatment for the participants is summarized in the table. Among the vaccinated patients, 86 (83.5%) had received Pfizer vaccine, and 92 (89.3%) of the patients had received both the doses, three weeks apart. VE of mRNA based vaccines against any COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and ICU admission is shown. In liver transplant patients VE was 84.1% (38.2%-96.2%, p = 0.002) for any documented infection. VE was 88.9% (26.4%- 98.9%, p = 0.003), and 92.8% (22.8%- 99.8%, p = 0.003) for COVID-19 related hospitalizations and ICU admissions respectively.(Table Presented)Conclusion: In liver transplant patients, two doses of mRNA based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is effective against any documented infection. The protection is higher against hospitalization and ICU admissions. Combined analysis of cellular and humoral response is needed to identify vaccine responders

N2  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effectiveness of currently available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unknown. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in a nationwide cohort of patients with IBD in Qatar. METHODS: Using a cohort design, we compared 476 IBD patients vaccinated identified between January 1, 2021, and March 31, 2021, with 476 matched unvaccinated controls (matched on age and date of SARS-CoV-2 testing). Study outcomes included documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic COVID-19, and COVID-19 related hospitalization. We also studied the side effects of the vaccination, including the effect on IBD exacerbation and hospitalizations related to adverse events. RESULTS: Total follow-up was 23,289 person-days for the vaccinated and 23,653 person-days for the unvaccinated group. Vaccine effectiveness >14 days [AAB1] after the second dose was 85.1% (95% CI: 65.2, 93.6) for confirmed infection, and 87.1% (95% CI: 63.6, 95.4)[AAB2] for symptomatic infection. No patient required hospitalization >14 days after the second vaccine dose. Estimated vaccine effectiveness between 22 to 35 days after the first dose was 14.8% (95% CI: -151.5, 71.2) [AAB3] for any documented infection, and 59.8% (95% CI: -106.1, 92.2) for symptomatic COVID-19 disease. For patients taking biologics with or without immunomodulators, vaccine effectiveness >14 days after the second dose was 94% (95% CI: 53.1, 99.2), and 92.7% (95% CI: 45.1, 99.0) for any documented infection and symptomatic COVID-19 respectively. Vaccine effectiveness was 87.4% (95% CI: 46.0, 97.1) for any documented infection and 91.7% (95% CI: 37.2, 98.9) for symptomatic COVID-19 during the same period for patients taking immunomodulators alone. None of the vaccinated patients required intensive care unit admission or died. No patient had IBD exacerbation or required hospitalization for vaccinationrelated adverse events. CONCLUSION: In a nationwide cohort of IBD patients, the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was safe and highly effective.

N2  - Background & Aims: The effectiveness of currently available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unknown. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in a nationwide cohort of patients with IBD in Qatar. Methods: Using a cohort design, we compared 476 IBD patients vaccinated identified between January 1, 2021, and March 31, 2021, with 476 matched unvaccinated controls (matched on age and date of SARS-CoV-2 testing). Study outcomes included documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic COVID-19, and COVID-19 related hospitalization. We also studied the side effects of the vaccination, including the effect on IBD exacerbation and hospitalizations related to adverse events. Results: Total follow-up was 23,289 person-days for the vaccinated and 23,653 person-days for the unvaccinated group. Vaccine effectiveness >14 days [AAB1] after the second dose was 85.1% (95% CI: 65.2, 93.6) for confirmed infection, and 87.1% (95% CI: 63.6, 95.4)[AAB2] for symptomatic infection. No patient required hospitalization >14 days after the second vaccine dose. Estimated vaccine effectiveness between 22 to 35 days after the first dose was 14.8% (95% CI: -151.5, 71.2) [AAB3] for any documented infection, and 59.8% (95% CI: -106.1, 92.2) for symptomatic COVID-19 disease. For patients taking biologics with or without immunomodulators, vaccine effectiveness >14 days after the second dose was 94% (95% CI: 53.1, 99.2), and 92.7% (95% CI: 45.1, 99.0) for any documented infection and symptomatic COVID-19 respectively. Vaccine effectiveness was 87.4% (95% CI: 46.0, 97.1) for any documented infection and 91.7% (95% CI: 37.2, 98.9) for symptomatic COVID-19 during the same period for patients taking immunomodulators alone. None of the vaccinated patients required intensive care unit admission or died. No patient had IBD exacerbation or required hospitalization for vaccination-related adverse events. Conclusion: In a nationwide cohort of IBD patients, the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was safe and highly effective. [Formula presented] [Formula presented]

N2  - Background: We estimated SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron-specific effectiveness of 2 and 3 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses in adults against symptomatic illness in US outpatient settings. Methods: Between October 1, 2021, and February 12, 2022, research staff consented and enrolled eligible participants who had fever, cough, or loss of taste or smell and sought outpatient medical care or clinical SARS-CoV-2 testing within 10 days of illness onset. Using the test-negative design, we compared the odds of receiving 2 or 3 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses among SARS-CoV-2 cases versus controls using logistic regression. Regression models were adjusted for study site, age, onset week, and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated as (1 – adjusted odds ratio) x 100%. Results: Among 3847 participants included for analysis, 574 (32%) of 1775 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the Delta predominant period and 1006 (56%) of 1794 participants tested positive during the Omicron predominant period. When Delta predominated, VE against symptomatic illness in outpatient settings was 63% (95% CI: 51% to 72%) among mRNA 2-dose recipients and 96% (95% CI: 93% to 98%) for 3-dose recipients. When Omicron predominated, VE was 21% (95% CI: -6% to 41%) among 2-dose recipients and 62% (95% CI: 48% to 72%) among 3-dose recipients. Conclusions: In this adult population, 3 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses provided substantial protection against symptomatic illness in outpatient settings when the Omicron variant became the predominant cause of COVID-19 in the U.S. These findings support the recommendation for a 3rd mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose.

N2  - Background Despite the potential widespread global use of the ChAdOx1-S booster, to date there are no published data on the real-world effectiveness. VE studies have found one and two doses of the ChAdOx1-S vaccine to be highly effective, and clinical trial data have demonstrated enhanced immunity following a ChAdOx1-S booster. In England, some individuals received a ChAdOx1-S booster where vaccination with mRNA vaccines was clinically contraindicated. Methods The demographic characteristics of those who received a ChAdOx1-S booster were compared to those who received a BNT162b2 booster. A test-negative case control design was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness of the ChAdOx1-S booster against symptomatic disease and hospitalisation in England. Findings Those who received a ChAdOx1-S booster were more likely to be female (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.67 (1.64-1.71)), in a clinical risk group (adjusted OR 1.58 (1.54-1.63)), in the CEV group (adjusted OR 1.84 (1.79-1.89)) or severely immunosuppressed (adjusted OR 2.05 (1.96-2.13)). Protection against symptomatic disease in those aged 65 years and older peaked at 66.1% (16.6 to 86.3%) and 68.5% (65.7 to 71.2%) amongst those who received the ChAdOx1-S and BNT162b2 booster vaccines, respectively. Protection waned to 44.5% (22.4 to 60.2%) and 54.1% (50.5 to 57.5%) after 5-9 weeks. Protection against hospitalisation following Omicron infection peaked at 82.3% (64.2 to 91.3%) after receiving a ChAdOx1-S booster, as compared to 90.9% (88.7 to 92.7%) for those who received a BNT162b2 booster. Interpretation Differences in the population boosted with ChAdOx1-S in England renders direct comparison of vaccine effectiveness by manufacturer challenging. Nonetheless, this study supports the use of the ChAdOx1-S booster for protection against severe disease with COVID-19 in settings that have not yet offered booster doses and suggests that those who received ChAdOx1-S as a booster in England do not require re-vaccination ahead of others.

N2  - The BA.1 sub-lineage of the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant, first detected in the UK in mid-November 2021, rapidly became the dominant strain partly due to reduced vaccine effectiveness. An increase in a second Omicron sub-lineage BA.2 was observed in early January 2022. In this study we use a test-negative case control study design to estimate vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease with BA.1 and BA.2 after one or two doses of BNT162b2, ChAdOx1-S or mRNA-1273, and after booster doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 during a period of co-circulation. Overall, there was no evidence that vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease is reduced following infection with the BA.2 sub-lineage as compared to BA.1. Furthermore, similar rates of waning were observed after the second and booster dose for each sub-lineage. These data provide reassuring evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccines currently in use against symptomatic disease caused by BA.2.

N2  - Background In a context of multiple Omicron lineages circulation, it is relevant to clarify the effect of vaccination and previous infections on the risk of infection and severe post-infection outcomes. Methods Using electronic health records and SARS-CoV-2 laboratory surveillance data, we conducted a case-case and a cohort study covering the period of Omicron BA.2/BA.5 lineage replacement in Portugal, to compare vaccine effectiveness of complete primary and booster dose against infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, and mortality. Variant classification was performed through whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or Spike Gene Target Failure (SGTF). Findings Between April 25 and June 10, 2022, within a total of 27702 collected samples, 55.5% were classified as BA.2 and the remaining as BA.5. We observed no evidence of reduced vaccine effectiveness for the primary complete vaccination (OR=1.07, CI95%:0.93-1.23) or booster dose vaccination (OR=0.96, CI95%:0.84-1.09) against BA.5 infection compared with BA.2. The protection against reinfection was inferior in BA.5 cases when compared with BA.2 (OR=1.44; CI95%:1.30-1.60). Among those infected with BA.5, booster vaccination was associated with 77% and 88% of reduction in risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and death, respectively, while higher risk reduction was found for BA.2 cases, with 93% and 94%, respectively. Interpretation This study shows that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5 lineage is associated with higher odds of reinfection compared with Omicron BA.2, regardless of the vaccination status. Although less effective compared with BA.2, COVID-19 booster vaccination still offers substantial protection against severe outcomes following BA.5 infection.

N2  - Vaccines against coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) have shown to be greatly effective in preventing viral spread, serious illness and death from this infectious disease and are therefore critical for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the listing of myocarditis and pericarditis as possible rare side effects of the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against COVID-19 by regulatory agencies has sparked discussion on the vaccines’ safety. The most important published cohort studies to date demonstrat that myocarditis is a very rare side effect after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, with an incidence of approximately 1–4 cases per 100,000 vaccinated persons. Young males (16–29 years) appear to be at highest risk, predominantly after receiving the second dose. The disease course is self-limiting in a vast majority of cases: 95% of patients show a rapid resolution of symptoms and normalisation of cardiac biomarkers, electro- and echocardiographic findings within days. Importantly, the available data suggest that the incidence rate of myocarditis in the context of COVID-19 is much greater than the risk of this side effect following vaccination. We conclude that the benefit of vaccination against COVID-19 outweighs the potential risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in both adolescents and adults. Prospective follow-up of patients who have developed these complications after vaccination is required to assess long-term outcomes.

N2  - Statement of Purpose, Innovation, or Hypothesis: To ascertain the effectiveness of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine among the healthcare workers by characterizing the breakthrough infections which occurred 14 days after the second dose of the vaccine. Description of Methods and Materials: We prospectively evaluated the 'Institutional Covid Vaccination Database' to categorize the SARS-CoV-2 positive healthcare workers into 2 cohorts: infected vaccinated and infected unvaccinated cohort. Along with comparing the descriptive statistics of the cohorts, the relative risk (RR), relative risk reduction (RRR), and the vaccine effectiveness were calculated. The study population was compared for the significant difference by using the parametric model (binary logistic regression) for the Odds ratio and the non-parametric model (cox proportionality model) for the Hazard ratio. Data and Results: Out of the 324 healthcare workers employed in our institution 243 (75%) were vaccinated. When 6.58% (16) of the vaccinated healthcare workers were tested positive, 43.75% (35) were infected in the unvaccinated cohort and the median time of infection in the vaccinated cohort was 65 days (range 20 -91 days). While the cox proportionality model reveals that the age, sex, and the contact exposure status of the cohort are not significant factors for getting infected after being vaccinated, binary logistic regression proves that a significant relationship exists between the incidence of infection and the unvaccinated status (p = 0.001, OR = 4.278). Completing the two-dose of vaccination decreased the hazard of testing positive for the SARS-CoV-2 by 84.96% when compared with the unvaccinated individuals, which is the effectiveness of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Interpretation, Conclusion or Significance: There is an increased risk of the third wave of COVID-19 infection in the upcoming months. So, primary infection control measures should be followed even if vaccinated, to prevent the risk of breakthrough infections.

N2  - Purpose: Studies on the immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccines are necessary to evaluate the ongoing vaccination programs by correlating serological response data and clinical effectiveness data. We performed a longitudinal immunological profiling of health care workers vaccinated with mRNA-1273 (Moderna, Cambridge, MA, USA). Half of these vaccinees had experienced a mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in the spring of 2020 (“COVID-recovered” cohort), whereas the other half of the vaccinees had no previous COVID-19 infection (“COVID-naive” cohort). Materials and Methods: Serum was drawn at multiple time points and subjected to assays measuring anti-Spike immunoglobulin G (IgG), avidity of anti-Spike IgG, avidity of anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, virus neutralizing activity, and interferon-ɣ release from stimulated lymphocytes. Results: Between both cohorts and within each cohort, we found remarkable inter-individual differences regarding cellular and humoral immune responses to the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine. Conclusion: First, our study indicates that the success of mRNA-1273 vaccinations should be verified by serological assays in order to identify “low-responders” to vaccination. Second, the kinetics of anti-S IgG and neutralizing activity correlate well with clinical effectiveness data, thus explaining incipient protection against infection 2 weeks after the first dose of mRNA-1273 in COVID-naive vaccinees. Third, our IgG-avidity data indicate that this incipient protection is mediated by low-avidity anti-RBD IgG and low-avidity anti-S IgG.

N2  - Background. While a 3-dose mRNA-1273 primary series is recommended for moderately or severely immunocompromised (IC) individuals in the U.S., some IC individuals do not complete the 3-dose series. We conducted a matched cohort study to evaluate the relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of the 3-dose mRNA-1273 primary series vs. 2 doses of mRNA-1273 in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 disease in IC individuals. Methods. IC individuals aged ≥18 years with ≥12 months of Kaiser Permanente Southern California membership who received 3 doses of mRNA-1273 ≥24 days apart were 1:1 matched with randomly selected IC 2-dose recipients on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and 2nd dose date. Third doses were accrued from 08/12/2021 to 12/31/2021, with follow-up through 1/31/2022, spanning the delta and omicron periods. Outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive molecular test or diagnosis code), COVID-19 hospitalization, and COVID-19 hospital death. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models. Adjusted rVE (%) was calculated as (1-aHR) x 100. Results. Our study included 21,942 3-dose and 21,942 2-dose mRNA-1273 IC recipients. Adjusted rVE of 3 doses compared to 2 doses of mRNA-1273 against SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, and COVID-19 hospital death were 55.0% (95% CI: 50.8-58.9%), 83.0% (75.4-88.3%), and 87.1% (30.6-97.6%), respectively (Table 1). Adjusted rVE against SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from 43.0% to 59.1% across subgroups of age, sex, race/ethnicity, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, pregnancy, and comorbidities (Table 2). Point estimates of the 3-dose rVE were higher against COVID-19 infection and hospitalization in the first 3 months, compared to 3-6 months after the 3rd dose (Table 3). Conclusion. Three doses of mRNA-1273 provide additional protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes for IC individuals, compared to 2 doses, highlighting the importance of completing 3-doses for IC populations. However, possible waning of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes after 3 months supports the ACIP recommendation of a booster dose at least 3 months after the 3rd primary series dose for adequate protection of IC individuals. (Table Presented).

N2  - Background/Purpose: Treatment of autoinflammatory periodic syndromes with the interleukin-1β inhibitor canakinumab (CAN) has been shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials and in practice. Patients are recommended to be vaccinated against common infections (including influenza, covid-19, pneumococcus) while on therapy, as is the general population. It is known from the literature that severe local and systemic inflammatory reactions can occur frequently in patients with immunosuppressive therapy, especially after pneumococcal vaccination. Therefore, in the present study, in addition to general safety parameters, the safety of the recommended vaccinations in patients with CAPS, FMF, HIDS/MKD and TRAPS under CAN therapy was investigated in clinical practice. Methods: RELIANCE is a prospective, non-interventional observational study in Germany enrolling pediatric (age ≥2 years) and adult patients with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of autoinflammatory periodic syndrome who routinely receive CAN. Efficacy and safety parameters were recorded at baseline and assessed at 6-months intervals. Results: The interim analysis includes data from N=199 patients with autoinflammatory diseases enrolled in the RELIANCE registry between October 2017 and December 2021. The mean age of the overall cohort is 24.4 years (2-79 years; N=104 female patients [53%]) and the median duration of CAN treatment before study entry was 2 years (0-12 years). During the study, N=87 patients received a total of 130 vaccinations. Vaccination reactions were reported for N=16 patients, and N=8 patients were classified as suspected adverse drug reactions (Table 1). In no case was the vaccination reaction classified as severe. Covid-19 vaccination was given to N=42 patients (N=6 Comirnaty, N=1 Spikevax, N=36 not reported; 1 patient received 2 different vaccines). Of these, vaccination reactions were reported for N=6 patients, which were not considered drugrelated or classified as severe. Conclusion: The interim data from the RELIANCE study confirm the safety of long-term treatment with canakinumab in the entire study population. Vaccination while on CAN therapy also did not reveal any new safety signals beyond known vaccine side effects. Table 1: Overview of vaccinations and vaccination side effects in the RELIANCE study across all study indications (N=199 patients).

Of these, a vaccination reaction was reported for N=6 patients, which were not considered drug-related or classified as severe. Conclusion: The interim data from the RELIANCE study confirm the safety of long-term treatment with canakinumab in the entire study population. Vaccination with CAN therapy also did not reveal any new safety signals beyond known vaccine side effects.

N2  - Background and aims: Some disease modifying treatments (DMT) used in multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment were associated with a greater risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and may compromise seroconversion following infection and vaccination. We aim to evaluate the immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines, as measured by antibody and T-cell responses, in a real-world cohort of MS patients under different DMT. Methods: Multicentre prospective cohort study of 500 MS patients vaccinated against COVID-19, with 3 study visits: 14-56 days, 3 months, and 9 months after completing vaccination. Demographic and clinical data including MS history and treatment, COVID-19 infection and vaccination will be collected. Analyses include lymphocyte counts and immunophenotyping, IgM and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2- spike and -nucleocapside proteins, and SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapside protein-specific T-cell responses. Recruitment is open until 15th March 2022. We present preliminary baseline data of 161 patients. Results: 64.6% women, mean age 43.3 years. Mean time since diagnosis 9.4 years; mean EDSS was 2.4. Six patients (3.7%) had COVID-19 before vaccination, 84.5% had a complete mRNA vaccine scheme and 13.0% a mixt mRNA or adenovirus scheme; 73.9% had a boosted mRNA vaccine. 84.5% presented reactive T spots against total SARS-CoV-2 and spike protein. Conclusion: The COVACiMS study will provide relevant information regarding the effectiveness of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine according to DMT use in a Portuguese MS population. This data may support clinical decision making.

Design: A case-control study of 11,690 hospitalized adults. Setting: Twenty-one hospitals across the United States. Participants: This study included 5728 cases hospitalized with COVID-19 and 5962 controls hospitalized without COVID-19. Cases were classified into SARS-CoV-2 variant groups based on viral whole genome sequencing, and if sequencing did not reveal a lineage, by the predominant circulating variant at the time of hospital admission: Alpha (March 11 to July 3, 2021), Delta (July 4 to December 25, 2021), and Omicron (December 26, 2021 to January 14, 2022). Main Outcome Measures: Vaccine effectiveness was calculated using a test-negative design for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to prevent COVID-19 hospitalizations by each variant (Alpha, Delta, Omicron). Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, disease severity on the WHO Clinical Progression Ordinal Scale was compared among variants using proportional odds regression. Results: Vaccine effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines to prevent COVID-19-associated hospitalizations included: 85% (95% CI: 82 to 88%) for 2 vaccine doses against Alpha; 85% (95% CI: 83 to 87%) for 2 doses against Delta; 94% (95% CI: 92 to 95%) for 3 doses against Delta; 65% (95% CI: 51 to 75%) for 2 doses against Omicron; and 86% (95% CI: 77 to 91%) for 3 doses against Omicron. Among hospitalized unvaccinated COVID-19 patients, severity on the WHO Clinical Progression Scale was higher for Delta than Alpha (adjusted proportional odds ratio [aPOR] 1.28, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.46), and lower for Omicron than Delta (aPOR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.77). Compared to unvaccinated cases, severity was lower for vaccinated cases for each variant, including Alpha (aPOR 0.33, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.49), Delta (aPOR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.51), and Omicron (aPOR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.85). Conclusions: mRNA vaccines were highly effective in preventing COVID-19-associated hospitalizations from Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants, but three vaccine doses were required to achieve protection against Omicron similar to the protection that two doses provided against Delta and Alpha. Among adults hospitalized with COVID-19, Omicron caused less severe disease than Delta, but still resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality. Vaccinated patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had significantly lower disease severity than unvaccinated patients for all the variants.

N2  - Objectives and Study: Some studies have shown decreased serological response to vaccination in patients on anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) medications. While the large majority of these patients do seroconvert after vaccination, titers have generally been lower and one study showed reduced neutralizing and inhibitory functions. One real-world population-based study compared found no increased infection rate in anti-TNF treated patients, but infection rates were low. The low event rate mandates exploration in longer-term population-based data. We used the epi-Israeli IBD Research Nucleus (IIRN) database to explore the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in IBD patients in Israel. Methods: We included all IBD patients insured in two of the four Israeli HMOs, covering 35% of the population, by validated algorithms, and selected those who received two doses of Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine. These were matched by date of vaccination ±3 days and demographic variables to non-IBD controls. The primary outcome was incidence of positive COVID-19 PCR following vaccination between December, 2020 to June, 2021. Results: 12,640 IBD patients received two vaccine doses; the matched cohort included,4946 matched pairs (total 9,892 subjects). Mean age was 50.5±16.1 years and median follow-up was 22 weeks (range 4.1-24.4). Fifteen (0.3%) vaccinated IBD patients tested positive compared with 15 (0.3%) vaccinated non-IBD controls (OR=1 [95%CI 0.49-2.05], p=1.0). Patients on anti-TNF and/or corticosteroids did not have a higher incidence of positivity-neither compared to the entire group nor to IBD patients treated with vedolizumab/ustekinumab, even after precise matching for demographics, underlying diseases and IBD severity. Conclusions: In a large population-based cohort of IBD patients in Israel, vaccine effectiveness was equivalent to non-IBD controls and was not influenced by treatment with anti-TNF or corticosteroids. Notwithstanding previous findings of impaired serological response in anti-TNF treated IBD patients, this real-world large-scale study shows that vaccine protection is robust in IBD patients, including those on immunosuppressive medications.

N2  - Background. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), during the 2019-20 U.S. influenza season, influenza resulted in almost 180,000 hospitalizations and over 13,000 deaths in adults ≥ 65 years. The current study evaluated the relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (aTIV) compared to high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV-HD), against influenza-related hospitalizations/emergency room (ER) visits, all-cause hospitalizations and hospitalizations/ER visits for cardio-respiratory disease (CRD) among adults ≥65 years for the 2019-20 influenza season. Methods. A retrospective cohort analysis of older adults (≥ 65 years) was conducted using IQVIA's professional fee, prescription claims and hospital charge master data in the U.S. Baseline characteristics included age, gender, payer type, geographic region, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), comorbidities, indicators of frail health status, and pre-index hospitalization rates. To avoid any influenza outcome misclassification with COVID-19 infection, the study period ended March 7, 2020. Adjusted analyses were conducted through inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to control for selection bias. Poisson regression was used to estimate the adjusted pairwise rVE against influenza-related hospitalizations/ ER visits, all-cause hospitalizations and any hospitalization/ER visit for CRD. An unrelated negative control outcome, urinary tract infection (UTI) hospitalization was included. Results. During the 2019-20 influenza season, following IPTW, 798,987 recipients of aTIV and 1,655,979 recipients of TIV-HD were identified. After IPTW adjustment and Poisson regression, aTIV was statistically comparable to TIV-HD for prevention of influenza-related hospitalizations/ER visits (3.1%; 95% CI: -2.8%-8.6%) and all-cause hospitalizations (-0.7%; 95% CI: -1.6%-0.3%). Similar comparable outcomes were found for reduction of any hospitalization/ER visit for CRD (0.9%; 95% CI: 0.0%-1.7%). No treatment effect was identified for the negative control outcome. Conclusion. aTIV and TIV-HD demonstrated comparable reductions in influenza-related hospitalizations/ER visits, all-cause hospitalizations and hospitalizations/ ER visits for CRD.

N2  - Background Belief in immunity from prior infection and concern that vaccines might not protect against new variants are contributors to vaccine hesitancy. We assessed effectiveness of full and partial COVID-19 vaccination against reinfection when Delta was the predominant variant in New York City. Methods We conducted a case-control study in which case-patients with reinfection during June 15-August 31, 2021 and control subjects with no reinfection were matched (1:3) on age, sex, timing of initial positive test in 2020, and neighborhood poverty level. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate matched odds ratios (mOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Of 349,598 adult residents who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in 2020, did not test positive again >90 days after initial positive test through June 15, 2021, and did not die before June 15, 2021, 1,067 were reinfected during June 15-August 31, 2021. Of 1,048 with complete matching criteria data, 499 (47.6%) were known to be symptomatic for COVID-19-like-illness, and 75 (7.2%) were hospitalized. Unvaccinated individuals, compared with fully vaccinated individuals, had elevated odds of reinfection (mOR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.90, 2.61), of symptomatic reinfection (mOR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.72, 2.74), and of reinfection with hospitalization (mOR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.43, 4.69). Partially versus fully vaccinated individuals had 1.58 (95% CI: 1.22, 2.06) times the odds of reinfection. All three vaccines authorized or approved for use in the U.S. were similarly effective. Conclusion Among adults with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination reduced odds of reinfections when the Delta variant predominated.

N2  - Background Many people have experienced a high burden due to the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its serious consequences for health and everyday life. Prior studies have reported that physical activity (PA) may lower the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. The present meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42022339672) explored the dose– response relationship between PA and the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. Methods Epidemiological observational studies on the relationship between PA and the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization were included. Categorical dose–response relationships between PA and the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization were assessed using random effect models. Robust error meta-regression models assessed the continuous relationship between PA (metabolic equivalent [MET]–h/week) and COVID-19 hospitalization risk across studies reporting quantitative PA estimates. Results Seventeen observational studies (cohort\case–control\cross-section) met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Categorical dose-relationship analysis showed a 40% (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.48–0.71) reduction in the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization compared to the lowest dose of PA. The results of the continuous dose–response relationship showed a non-linear inverse relationship (Pnon-linearity < 0.05) between PA and the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. When total PA was less than or greater than 10 Met-h/week, an increase of 4 Met-h/week was associated with a 14% (RR = 0.83, 95%CI: 0.85–0.87) and 11% (RR = 0.89, 95%CI: 0.87–0.90) reduction in the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization, respectively. Conclusions There was an inverse non-linear dose–response relationship between PA level and the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. Doses of the guideline-recommended minimum PA levels by WTO may be required for more substantial reductions in the COVID-19 hospitalization risk.

N2  - Object: It remains unelucidated regarding the effects of vaccination on disease severity and factors for viral clearance and hospitalization in omicron-infected patients. Methods: The clinical manifestations of 3,265 Omicron-infected patients (BA.2 variant; the Omicron group) were compared with those of 226 Delta-infected patients (the Delta group).A Multi-class logistic regression model was employed to analyze the impacts of vaccination doses and intervals on disease severity; a logistic regression model to evaluate the risk factors for hospitalization; R 4.1.2 data analysis to investigate the factors for time for nucleic acid negativization (NAN). Results: Compared with the Delta group, the Omicron group reported a fast transmission, mild symptoms, and lower severity incidence, and a significant inverse correlation of vaccination dose with clinical severity (OR: 0.803, 95%CI: 0.742-0.868, p<0.001). Of the 7 or 5 categories of vaccination status, the risk of severity significantly decreased only at ≥21 days after three doses (OR: 0.618, 95% CI: 0.475-0.803, p<0.001; OR: 0.627, 95% CI: 0.482-0.815, p<0.001, respectively). The Omicron group also reported underlying illness as an independent factor for hospitalization, sore throat as a protective factor, and much shorter time for NAN [15 (12,19) vs. 16 (12,22), p<0.05]. NAN was associated positively with age, female gender, fever, cough, and disease severity, but negatively with vaccination doses. Conclusion: Booster vaccination should be advocated for COVID-19 pandemic-related control and prevention policies and adequate precautions should be taken for patients with underlying conditions.

N2  - In April 2022, a COVID-19 outbreak caused by the Omicron variant emerged in Guangzhou. A case–control study was conducted to explore the relationship between vaccination intervals and SARS-CoV-2 infection in the real world. According to the vaccination dose and age information of the cases, a 1:4 matched case–control sample was established, finally including n = 242 for the case group and n = 968 for the control group. The results indicated that among the participants who received three vaccine doses, those with an interval of more than 300 days between the receipt of the first vaccine dose and infection (or the first contact with a confirmed case) were less likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 than those with an interval of less than 300 days (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.46–0.99). After age-stratified analysis, among participants aged 18–40 years who received two doses of vaccine, those who received the second dose more than 30 days after the first dose were less likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.30–0.96). Our findings suggest that we need to extend the interval between the first dose and the second dose and further explore the optimal interval between the first and second and between the second and third doses in order to improve vaccine efficacy.

N2  - Immunosuppression increases the risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Morbidity and mortality of this disease in kidney transplant patients are higher than in the general population. As the vaccination response of transplant patients is weak, serological monitoring was performed. In this cohort study, we analyzed the determinants of vaccination response. All patients had no history of COVID-19. With anti-spike IgG monitoring, 148 responders and 415 non-responders were identified. We compared both groups using multivariate analyses of the cohort and a sub-cohort of mycophenolic-acid-treated patients. We investigated the influence of patient characteristics, immunosuppression, and erythrocyte inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) activity. In responders, the time after transplantation was longer (13.5 vs. 8.5 years), the glomerular filtration rate was higher (56.9 vs. 47.8 mL/min/1.73 m2), and responders were younger (53.0 vs. 57.4 years). Heterologous vaccination was more effective than homologous vaccination. Calcineurin inhibitors plus mycophenolate reduced the seroconversion rate. No seroconversion was observed in belatacept patients. In mycophenolate-treated patients, IMPDH activity was a significantly better predictor of response than mycophenolate dose (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.62, p <0.001). Immunosuppression strongly affects vaccine response. Modifications to immunosuppression should be considered in order to facilitate this response. Erythrocyte IMPDH activity can be used to guide mycophenolate treatment.

N2  - Background: A diagnosis of schizophrenia is the second largest predictor of mortality from COVID-19, after age (Nemani, 2021). Clozapine-treated patients may be particularly vulnerable since clozapine causes metabolic side effects that are associated with increased mortality from COVID-19. While COVID-19 vaccines represent the most effective preventive measure, patients with serious mental illness (SMI) have low vaccination rates in general compared to their peers without SMI (Lorenz, 2013). Psychiatric providers, who are experts in behavioral management, are in frequent contact with their patients, hence uniquely positioned to help shape patients’ vaccine attitudes and address barriers to vaccination. Methods: A quality improvement project was designed to help psychiatric providers identify vaccine-hesitant patients, build vaccine confidence, and support COVID-19 vaccinations in a cohort of 193 clozapine-treated patients with SMI in a community mental health center. In-service education was provided to enhance clinicians’ vaccine knowledge and to apply their expertise in nudging and motivational interviewing to resolve patients’ vaccine ambivalence (McClure, 2017). At each visit starting in February 2021, clinicians conducted guided interview using a population-based management tool created based on literature and embedded in the electronic medical record to track patients’ vaccination intention, hesitancy, and uptake. Results: The actual vaccination rate in our clozapine cohort by the end of June 2021 was 84.5% compared to the MA state rate on the same date estimated to be between 62.5% and 77.3%. The increased vaccination rate was seen across all age groups. The content of vaccine hesitancy in this cohort prior to wide-spread vaccine availability and the practical barriers to completing vaccination series were qualitatively described. Discussion: By standardizing a process of vaccination support at outpatient psychiatric visits, psychiatric providers may positively impact vaccination rates among patients with SMI. Patients with SMI may face many barriers to vaccination and could benefit from psychiatric provider making sure they get fully vaccinated. Conclusion/Implications: Psychiatric patients, particularly those who are marginalized, have much to gain if psychiatric providers are involved in preventive health care such as the annual flu vaccine and hepatitis B (Freudenreich, 2021).

N2  - Background: A large-scale community COVID-19 outbreak occurred between April and August 2021 in Taiwan, where non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been strictly implemented and COVID-19 vaccination program was not implemented until 1 March, 2021. Although COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for at-risk populations, the vaccine effectiveness in people living with HIV (PLWH) remains incompletely understood. We evaluated the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination among PLWH during a COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan. Methods: From 1 March to 30 September, 2021, all adult PLWH without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were included and advised to receive 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine. The government-funded vaccination campaign provided different types of COVID-19 vaccine, including ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and MVC-COV1901 (Medigen) vaccines. The primary endpoint of this study was the vaccine effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 among PLWH, which was estimated by comparing incidence rates between the unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated groups in a dynamic cohort. Results: During the study period, 3131 PLWH were included, with 99.9% on antiretroviral therapy, 99.8% being MSM and median CD4 count of 627 cells/mm3. In the dynamic cohort, 3128 PLWH contributed 516892 person-days of follow-up (PDFU) to the unvaccinated group, 2476 PLWH contributed 139163 PDFU to the partially vaccinated group, and 236 PLWH contributed 12011 PDFU to the fully vaccinated group (Table). During the follow-up, 37 PLWH (1.2%) acquired SARS-CoV-2 infections. The incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 6.4 per 100,000 PDFU in the unvaccinated group, which decreased to 2.9 and 0 per 100,000 PDFU in the partially and fully vaccinated groups, respectively. The adjusted incidence rate ratios were 0.47 (95% CI, 0.17-1.32) in the partially vaccinated group and <0.01 in the fully vaccinated group compared with the unvaccinated group, resulting in vaccine effectiveness rates of 53.4% and 99.9% for single-and 2-dose COVID-19 vaccination, respectively. Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccination was clinically effective among PLWH during the outbreak setting where NPIs were strictly implemented.

N2  - Background: The decline in COVID-19 mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) is well established, however the impact of variant-specific immune evasion and waning protection remains unclear. Here, we use whole-genome-sequencing (WGS) to tease apart the contribution of these factors on the decline observed following the introduction of the Delta variant. Further, we evaluate the utility of calendar-period-based variant classification as an alternative to WGS. Methods: We conducted a test-negative-case-control study among people who received SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing in the Yale New Haven Health System between April 1 and August 24, 2021. Variant classification was performed using WGS and secondarily by calendar-period. We estimated VE as one minus the ratio comparing the odds of infection among vaccinated and unvaccinated people. Results: Overall, 2,029 cases (RT-PCR positive, sequenced samples) and 343,985 controls (negative RT-PCRs) were included. VE 14-89 days after 2nd dose was significantly higher against WGS-classified Alpha infection (84.4%, 95% confidence interval: 75.6-90.0%) than Delta infection (68.9%, CI: 58.0-77.1%, p-value: 0.013). The odds of WGS-classified Delta infection were significantly higher 90-149 than 14-89 days after 2nd dose (Odds ratio: 1.6, CI: 1.2-2.3). While estimates of VE against calendar-period-classified infections approximated estimates against WGS-classified infections, calendar-period-based classification was subject to outcome misclassification (35% during Alpha period, 4% during Delta period). Conclusions: These findings suggest that both waning protection and variant-specific immune evasion contributed to the lower effectiveness. While estimates of VE against calendar-period-classified infections mirrored that against WGS-classified infections, our analysis highlights the need for WGS when variants are co-circulating and misclassification is likely.

N2  - Background: The benefit of vaccination in people who experienced a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Objective: To estimate the effectiveness of primary (two-dose) and booster (third dose) vaccination against Omicron infection among people with a prior documented infection. Design: Test-negative case-control study. Setting: Yale New Haven Health System facilities. Participants: Vaccine eligible people who received SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing between November 1, 2021, and January 31, 2022. Measurements: We conducted two analyses, each with an outcome of Omicron BA.1 infection (S-gene target failure defined) and each stratified by prior SARS-CoV-2 infection status. We estimated the effectiveness of primary and booster vaccination. To test whether booster vaccination reduced the risk of infection beyond that of the primary series, we compared the odds among boosted and booster eligible people. Results: Overall, 10,676 cases and 119,397 controls were included (6.1% and 7.8% occurred following a prior infection, respectively). The effectiveness of primary vaccination 14-149 days after 2nd dose was 36.1% (CI, 7.1% to 56.1%) for people with and 28.5% (CI, 20.0% to 36.2%) without prior infection. The odds ratio comparing boosted and booster eligible people with prior infection was 0.83 (CI, 0.56 to 1.23), whereas the odds ratio comparing boosted and booster eligible people without prior infection was 0.51 (CI, 0.46 to 0.56). Limitations: Misclassification, residual confounding, reliance on TaqPath assay analyzed samples. Conclusion: While primary vaccination provided protection against BA.1 infection among people with and without prior infection, booster vaccination was only associated with additional protection in people without prior infection. These findings support primary vaccination in people regardless of prior infection status but suggest that infection history should be considered when evaluating the need for booster vaccination.

N2  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing a global pandemic and the clinical course of the disease shows great variation. Recent reports suggested that patients with hematological disorders such as leukemia, lymphoma and autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) had a higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 than the general population, and infected, also had an increased risk of severe disease course. Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may prevent infection, its effectiveness needs to be proven in this immunocompromised cohort. In the current study, HSCT recipients were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 using an mRNA vaccine based on mRNA molecules encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein and vector-based vaccine carrying the full-length structural surface glycoprotein (spikes protein) of SARS-CoV-2, with a tissue plasminogen activator leader sequence. Vaccine-induced antibodies against spike (S) glycoprotein 1 were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-COV-2 ELISA IgG). Cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed by interferon-gamma ELISpot, using an S1 protein and peptide pools of S1 and S2 of SARS-CoV-2 as stimuli. In HSCT patients vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (n=27), the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies increased (mean antibody ratio pre-vaccination 0.1, post first vaccination 2.3 and post second vaccination 5.3). But overall, only just over half showed an antibody response after two vaccinations. Cellular data also indicated a slight increase after vaccination. However, the patient numbers will need to be enlarged in the coming weeks. Follow-up examinations have to show whether this immunity is also protective.

N2  - Importance: Recent sublineages of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, including BA.4 and BA.5, may be associated with greater immune evasion and less protection against COVID-19 following vaccination. Objective: To evaluate the association between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination with 2, 3, or 4 doses among immunocompetent adults and the risk of medically attended COVID-19 illness during a period of BA.4/BA.5 predominant circulation; to evaluate the relative severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized cases across Omicron BA.1, BA.2/BA.2.12.1, and BA.4/BA.5 sublineage periods. Setting, Design and Participants: Test-negative study of adults with COVID-19-like illness (CLI) and molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 conducted in 10 states from December 16, 2021, to August 20, 2022. Exposure: mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Main Outcomes and Measures: Emergency department/urgent care encounters, hospitalizations, and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or in-hospital death. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the association between prior vaccination and medically attended COVID-19 was used to estimate VE, stratified by care setting and vaccine doses (2, 3, or 4 doses vs 0 doses as reference group). Among hospitalized case-patients, demographic and clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes including ICU admission and death were compared across sublineage periods. Results: Between June 19 – August 20, 2022, 82,229 ED/UC and 21,007 hospital encounters were included for the BA.4/BA.5 vaccine effectiveness analysis. Among adults hospitalized with CLI, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.68-0.83) for receipt of 2 vaccine doses at ≥150 days after receipt, 0.32 (95% CI: 0.20-0.50) for a third dose 7-119 days after receipt, and 0.64 (95% CI: 0.58-0.71) for a third dose ≥120 days (median 235 days) after receipt for cases vs controls. For COVID-19-associated hospitalization, among patients ages ≥65 years 7-59 and ≥60 days (median 88 days) after a fourth dose, ORs were 0.34 (95% CI: 0.25-0.47) and 0.43 (95% CI: 0.34-0.56), respectively. Among hospitalized cases, ICU admission and/or in-hospital death occurred in 21.4% during the BA.1 vs 14.7% during the BA.4/BA.5 period (standardized mean difference: 0.17). Conclusion: VE against medically attended COVID-19 illness decreased over time since last dose; receipt of one or two booster doses increased effectiveness over a primary series alone.

N2  - Background/Purpose: Due to demographic and disease-related factors, patients with lupus are deemed to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection than the general population, but they may be more hesitant to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Black individuals have a higher susceptibility to chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CCLE); however, these patients are underrepresented in COVID-19 studies. We studied vaccination and patients' perceptions during the early pandemic period in a predominantly Black cohort of patients with CCLE. Table. Factors Associated with COVID-19 Vaccination among Patients with Chronic Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus. Methods: Patients with a validated diagnosis of CCLE enrolled in the population-based Georgians Organized Against Lupus (GOAL) Cohort were surveyed early in the pandemic, January through August 2021, after COVID-19 vaccination was available in the U.S. Validated tools assessed vaccination perceptions and ad hoc questions assessed COVID-19 concerns and vaccine status.We studied the relationship between vaccination status and trusted sources, concerns, beliefs, and vaccination attitudes. Results: Of 158 respondents (54% primary CCLE and 46% CCLE + SLE), 82% returned the survey by August 2021. Most participants were Black (81%) and female (89%), with a mean age of 54; 40% reported living below the Federal poverty level and 42% were unemployed. Although 76% did not receive the vaccine, 17% and 6% received 1 and 2 doses, respectively. The most frequent vaccination attitudes were concerns about unfound problems (79%), unknown future effects (69%), unforeseen problems in children (50%), followed by reliability (49%), protection (48%), and safety (47%) (Fig. 1). Participants were highly concerned about COVID-19 infection consequences (Fig. 2). Black participants (p=0.01), those living in poverty (p=0.006), and unemployed (p< 0.001) were less likely to be vaccinated (Table 1). Doctors were a trusted source in 71% of participants, of which 31% received the vaccine (p=0.001). Mistrust was significantly related to unvaccinated status (p< 0.001). Participants who believed that lupus patients should get vaccinated, that vaccines protect against infection, or those that would get the vaccine regardless of a doctor's advice were more likely to be vaccinated (p< 0.001 for each); whereas those who believed the vaccine will cause lupus to flare (p=0.001), interacts with medications and causes harm (p=0.004), or is less effective in lupus patients than in the general population (p=0.007) were less likely to be vaccinated. Conclusion: In the early pandemic period, only 23% of patients with CCLE were COVID-19 vaccinated. Participants who were Black, living in poverty, or unemployed were less likely to be vaccinated. Concerns about COVID-19 infection were not associated with vaccine status; whereas mistrust and negative beliefs of vaccine benefits were more likely to occur among those unvaccinated. Despite that 71% participants trusted their doctors, only 31% received the vaccine. Longitudinal studies are needed to assess changes in perceptions and vaccination rates. Education interventions are critical to mitigate vaccine hesitancy in CCLE patients, particularly among those of Black race and socioeconomically disadvantaged.

N2  - Background: Using data from electronic health registries, this study intended to estimate the COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in the population aged 65 years and more, against symptomatic infection, COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths, overall and by time since complete vaccination. Methods: We stablished a cohort of individuals aged 65 and more years old, resident in Portugal mainland, using the National Health Service unique identifier User number to link eight electronic health registries. Outcomes included were symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, COVID-19 related hospitalizations or deaths. The exposures of interest were the mRNA vaccines (Cominarty or Spikevax) and the viral vector Vaxzevria vaccine. Complete scheme vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated as one minus the confounder adjusted hazard ratio, for each outcome, estimated by time-dependent Cox regression with time dependent vaccine exposure. Results: For the cohort of individuals aged 65-79 years, complete scheme VE against symptomatic infection varied between 43% (Vaxzevria) and 65% (mRNA vaccines). This estimate was slightly lower in the ≥80 year cohort (53% for mRNA vaccines. VE against COVID-19 hospitalization varied between 89% (95%CI: 52-94) for Vaxzevria and 95% (95%CI: 93-97) for mRNA vaccines for the cohort aged 65-79 years and was 76% (95%CI: 67-83) for mRNA vaccines in the ≥80 year cohort. High VE against COVID-19 related deaths were estimated, for both vaccine types, 95% and 81% for the 65-79 years and the ≥80 year cohort, respectively. We observed a significant waning of VE against symptomatic infection, with VE estimates reaching approximately 34% for both vaccine types and cohorts. Significant waning was observed for the COVID-19 hospitalizations in the ≥80 year cohort (decay from 83% 14-41 days to 63% 124 days after mRNA second dose). No significant waning effect was observed for COVID-19 related deaths in the period of follow-up of either cohorts. Conclusions: In a population with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 complications, we observed higher overall VE estimates against more severe outcomes for both age cohorts when compared to symptomatic infections. Considering the analysis of VE according to time since complete vaccination, the results showed a waning effect for both age cohorts in symptomatic infection and COVID-19 hospitalization for the 80 and more yo cohort.

N2  - Background: Vaccine mediated SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses should be carefully evaluated. With regular follow-up in healthy individuals, we aimed to determine SARS-CoV-2 serological responses post three doses of immunization and prior to breakthrough infections in the Canadian population. Methods: In a prospective cohort study, we enrolled 140 healthy participants post COVID-19 vaccination in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor–binding domain were quantified by immunoassay post three doses of immunization. With COVID-19 rapid antigen test, polymerase chain reaction, and whole genome sequencing, 27 breakthrough infections were identified. Results: Following SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (including BNT162b2, AZD1222, and mRNA-1273), the median serum anti-spike protein antibody level was 143.6 BAU/mL (binding antibody unit, interquartile range 79.0–266.6) post the first dose of immunization, 1046.4 BAU/mL (423.9–1738.2) post the second dose, and 1604.7 BAU/mL (700.1–3764.0) post the third dose. Observed differences were significant (p ≤ 0.001). The median antibody level of 1604.7 BAU/mL post third dose is 45.6 times that of the seroconversion level (35.2 BAU/mL). This indicates that most vaccines approved are effective in producing robust antibody responses. In seven breakthrough cases characterized by whole genome sequencing, prior to infection, antibody concentrations of breakthrough cases were at 3249.4 (Delta), 2748.4 (Delta), 4893.9 (Omicron), 209.1 (Omicron), and 231.5 (Omicron), 725.7 (Omicron), and 2346.6 (Omicron) BAU/mL. Compared with the average antibody concentration of 2057.7 BAU/mL (58 times that of the seroconversion concentration) from above seven cases, 37.2% of triple vaccinated, 19.0% of double vaccinated, and 1.5% single dosed individuals have higher SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Conclusions: Most vaccines are effective in producing robust antibody responses when more than one dose is given, and the more doses the higher the serological response. Likely due to the highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 variants, a significant number of participants have SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses lower than the average antibody concentration prior to the known breakthrough infections. Additional vaccination is likely required to ensure immunity against infection by SARS-CoV-2.

N2  - Background/Purpose: Rituximab (RTX) is a very effective treatment for autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRD). However, treatment increases risk of infections and impairs responses to vaccines. Prior studies from our group and others showed that many patients receiving RTX have absent or numerically low antibody titers of IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike after vaccination with 2 doses of the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines or 1 dose of Ad26.COV2.SCovid-19 vaccine. In August 2021, the CDC recommended that immunocompromised individuals receive a supplemental dose. Here, we evaluate the response to that dose. Methods: We conducted an observational cohort study on adult patients with AIRD treated with RTX since January 2020 at our institution. Details regarding disease treatment, Covid-19 infection and vaccinations, and immunologic parameters were abstracted through chart review and telephone calls. The anti-spike protein antibodies were measured using ELISA (Attelica IM COV2G or ADVIA Centaur COV2G, Siemens, Healthineers). For statistical analysis, we used the Mann Whitney test to compare continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. Results: Among 72 patients (median [IQR] age, 63 [54.8, 71] years), 52 (72.2%) received a supplemental Covid-19 vaccine from August 2021 to May 2022. The median (IQR) time from pre-vaccination RTX infusion to vaccination was 24 (18.5, 31) weeks. Of the 32 patients who had spike protein antibodies measured after the supplemental dose, 17 (53.1%) had detectable antibody titers. Compared to patients who had positive titers, those who were negative had lower levels of CD20 and more severe hypogammaglobinemia with lower IgM and IgG levels. Of the 22 patients who did not mount an antibody response after the original vaccine series, 8 patients (36%) had positive antibodies (seroconverted) after the supplemental dose. Patients were 15.2 times less likely to seroconvert if they had been hypergammaglobulinemic in the 12 months preceding the vaccination. There have been 21 infections in 19 patients since the beginning of the pandemic, including 11 infections after the supplemental dose. Of the 7 patients with spike antibody measurements who had Covid-19 infection at any point during the pandemic, 5 (71.4%) had positive spike antibodies. Five patients (26%) required hospitalization for their covid-19 infection, including 2 after receiving the supplemental dose. Three patients (60%) were treated in an ICU. 20 (28.6%) patients have received monoclonal antibodies pre-exposure prophylaxis, and none have had covid-19 after the prophylaxis. Conclusion: In this single-institution study of patients receiving RTX for autoimmune rheumatic diseases, approximately 1/3 of the patients who did not initially mount an antibody response to Covid-19 vaccination, were positive after the supplemental dose. We found that hypogammaglobulinemia was a strong negative predictor of seroconversion. Breakthrough infections occurred despite vaccination. Even after infection and vaccination, some patients did not seroconvert. Approximately a quarter of RTX treated patients have received monoclonal antibodies pre-exposure prophylaxis which to date has been highly efficacious in preventing infection.

N2  - Although laboratory data show that antibody responses to COVID-19 immunization give superior neutralization of certain circulating variations to spontaneous infection, few real-world epidemiological studies demonstrate the advantage of vaccination for previously infected individuals. This paper summarizes the outcomes of a case–control study conducted in Romania between March 2020 and October 2021 on patients previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. A case–control study was implemented after identification of 62 breakthrough cases. These cases were matched by age and gender to a 1:1 ratio with a control group of unvaccinated patients with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection status. There were no significant differences in the severity of cases and mortality between the study groups. However, unvaccinated patients had a shorter protection from natural immunity than patients with full vaccination status (58 days versus 89 days). The unvaccinated cases with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection were also statistically more likely to have a longer hospital admission duration (12.4 days versus 9.8 days), and required more non-invasive oxygen supplementation during their stay than breakthrough cases (37.1% versus 19.4%). Individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection who were not vaccinated are not at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection or mortality compared to those who were completely vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine Comirnaty® Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 and acquired a breakthrough infection within 2–3 months of the previous infection with a Beta or Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant. Although our findings are consistent with natural immunity offering similar short-term protection to a second dose of mRNA vaccine, all eligible individuals should be provided with immunization to lower their risk of infection, even if they have already been infected with SARS-CoV-2.

N2  - To investigate the association of the 2019–2020 influenza vaccine with prognosis of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2A, a large multi-database cohort study was conducted in four Italian regions (i.e., Lazio, Lombardy, Veneto, and Tuscany) and the Reggio Emilia province (Emilia-Romagna). More than 21 million adults were residing in the study area (42% of the population). We included 115,945 COVID-19 cases diagnosed during the first wave of the pandemic (February–May, 2020); 34.6% of these had been vaccinated against influenza. Three outcomes were considered: hospitalization, death, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission/death. The adjusted relative risk (RR) of being hospitalized in the vaccinated group when compared with the non-vaccinated group was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.86–0.88). This reduction in risk was not confirmed for death (RR = 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01–1.06), or for the combined outcome of ICU admission or death. In conclusion, our study, conducted on the vast majority of the population during the first wave of the pandemic in Italy, showed a 13% statistically significant reduction in the risk of hospitalization in some geographical areas and in the younger population. No impact of seasonal influenza vaccination on COVID-19 prognosis in terms of death and death or ICU admission was estimated.

N2  - Introduction: Nutritional supplements aimed at enhancing immune defense mechanisms for an effective antiviral immune response have been a growing focus of interest, particularly in the face of immunosenescence and to compensate for specific micronutrient deficiencies among elderly subjects. In Covid-19 infection and in the fall/winter season with influenza virus, additional tools for immunity enhancement provided by vaccines are sought. ABBC1 is a nutritional supplement a combinat ion of beta-1,3 / 1,6-glucan with inact ivated Saccharomyces cerevisae rich in selenium and zinc that allows a dosage compatible with the usual medication in patients vulnerable to this type of infections, often polymedicated, allowing to add an additional therapeutic tool in the fight against the pandemic. Objectives: The aim of the study was to determine whether nutritional supplementation could improve the immune response to these vaccines and themicronutrient status of the participants. The high tolerance, safety, and immediate availability of ABB C1® in all types of subjects receiving the influenza or COVID-19 vaccines including geriatric and immunocompromised populations. Methods: A single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 72 volunteers who received a synergistic combination of yeast-based ingredients with a unique β-1,3/1,6-glucan complex and a consortium of heat-treated probiotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae rich in selenium and zinc (ABB C1®) or placebo on the next day after getting vaccinated against influenza (Chiromas®) (n = 34) or the COVID-19 (Comirnaty®) (n = 38). The duration of treatment was 30 and 35 days for the influenza and COVID-19 vaccine groups, respectively. Results: Mean levels of CD4+T cells increased from 910.7 at baseline to 1000.2 cells/μL after the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in the ABB C1® group, whereas there was a decrease from 1055.1 to 929.8 cells/μL in the placebo group. Changes of CD3+T and CD8+T lymphocytes showed a similar trend. In the COVID-19 cohort, the increases in both IgG and IgM were higher in the ABB C1® supplement than in the placebo group. Serum levels of selenium and zinc showed a higher increase in subjects treated with the active product than in those receiving placebo. No serious adverse events related to ABB C1® or tolerance issues were reported. The study findings validate the capacity of the ABB C1® product to stimulate trained immunity. Conclusions: The administration of a nutritional supplement (ABB C1®) based on a combination of β-glucan and probiotic S. cerevisiae yeasts enriched with selenium and zinc in volunteers in association with influenza and COVID-19 mRNA vaccines appeared to be able to stimulate trained immunity as compared with placebo, which indicates that ABB C1® provides a reliable source of absorbable micronutrients relevant to enhance the immune function.

N2  - Background: To date, globally considered, the literature suggests that AIRD may be at higher risk of infection and death due to COVID19 compared to the general population. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 reduces the risk of hospitalization and mortality. However, immunological alteration associated with Autoimmune Infam-matory Rheumatic Diseases (AIRD) and immunosuppressive medications may impair the response to vaccination. Emerging data suggest that immunosuppres-sive treatment may negatively impact the response to anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the AIRD population; data are robust for some treatments, more controversial for others. Identifying patients at higher risk of lack of protection is essential for shielding them and for adapting therapeutic protocol and vaccination timing. Objectives: In the light of the current COVID19 epidemic and the availability of effective vaccines, this study aims to identify predictors of non-response to anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients affected by AIRD. Methods: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted evaluating the serological response and the persistence of antibodies at eight weeks in IRD patient cohort and non-IRD control. IRD and age and sex-matched controls volunteer among the health professionals (CTRL) who underwent vaccination with two doses of BNT162b2 were recruited for this study. Anti-Trimeric Spike protein antibodies were assayed eight ± one week after the second vaccine dose. Uni-variate and logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of non-response and low antibody titers. Results: Samples were obtained from 237 IRD patients (m/f 73/164, mean age 5 7, CI 95% [56-59]): 4 autoinfammatory diseases (AI), 62 connective tissue diseases (CTD), 86 rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 71 spondylarthritis (SpA) and 14 vasculitis (Vsc). 232 CTRL were recruited (m/f 71/161, mean age 5 7, CI 95% [56-58]). Globally, IRD had a lower seroconversion rate (88.6% vs 99.6%, CI 95% OR [1.61-5.73], p<0.0001) and lower antibody titer compared to controls (median (IQR) 403 (131.5-1012) vs 1160 (702.5-1675), p<0.0001). After logistic regression, age, corticosteroid (CCS), Abatacept (ABA), and Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) use were predictors of non-response. The antibody titers eight weeks after the second dose of vaccine were lower in AIRD compared to controls, median (IQR) 403 (131.5-1012) vs 1160 (702.5-1675), p<0.0001 with no difference between sexes and age groups. CTD, RA and SpA had lower antibodies levels. However, the logistic regression model identifed treatment with MMF, ABA, CCS, Methotrexate (MTX), Rituximab (RTX), Janus Kinase inhibitors (JAKi) and TNF inhibitors (TNFi) as independent predictors of serum titer. ABA, RTX, MMF, and MTX had the strongest effect size. Conclusion: The response to anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is often impaired in AIRD patients under treatment and may pose them at higher risk of severe COVID-19. Although this work focused on serological response, most of the treatment the impaired vaccine response are known to act on T cells, possibly also influencing the cellular response. Evidence-based protocols are required to time vaccination and treatment to improve immunization of AIRD patients.

N2  - Background: Comparative effectiveness of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines across patient subgroups is poorly understood and essential to precisely targeting vaccination strategies. Methods: We used the US Department of Veterans Affairs COVID-19 Shared Data Resource to identify veterans who utilize VA health care and had no documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection before December 11, 2020. Using a test-negative case-control design (TND), we used conditional logistic regression with adjustment for covariates to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) over time for veterans who received 2 doses of mRNA vaccines or 1 dose of Ad26.Cov2.S. Results: We identified 4.8 million veterans with a mean age of 64 years, of whom 58% had ≥1 chronic disease. Vaccine effectiveness for symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and ICU admission or death declined over time and varied by the type of vaccine (P < 0.01). VE estimates against symptomatic infection during months 1 and 7 for mRNA-1273 compared with BNT162b2 were 89.7% (95% CI, 84.4%-93.0%) and 57.3% (95% CI, 48.4%-64.7%) vs 81.6% (95% CI, 75.9%-85.9%) and 22.5% (95% CI, 7.2%-35.2%) for individuals age <65 years and 78.4% (95% CI, 71.1%-83.9%) and 36.2% (95% CI, 27.7%-43.6%) vs 66.3% (95% CI, 55.7%-74.4%) and -23.3% (95% CI, -40.5% to -8.2%) in subjects age ≥65 years; against hospitalization 92.0% (95% CI, 76.1%-97.3%) and 83.1% (95% CI, 66.8%-91.4%) vs 85.6% (95% CI, 72.6%-92.4%) and 57.0% (95% CI, 31.2%-73.2%) in subjects age <65 years and 66.1% (95% CI, 45.3%-79.0%) and 64.7% (95% CI, 55.2%-72.3%) vs 61.0% (95% CI, 41.3%-74.2%) and 1.7% (95% CI, -22.0% to 20.8%) in those age ≥65 years; against ICU admission or death 89.2% (95% CI, 49.5%-97.7%) and 84.4% (95% CI, 59.0%-94.1%) vs 87.6% (95% CI, 61.0%-96.1%) and 66.4% (95% CI, 7.7%-87.8%) in subjects age <65 years and 75.4% (95% CI, 51.7%-87.5%) and 73.8 (95% CI, 62.9%-81.5%) vs 67.4% (95% CI, 32.6%-84.3%) and 29.3% (95% CI, 2.3%-48.9%) in subjects age ≥65 years, respectively (Pinteraction <. 01 for all comparisons). Similarly, mRNA-1273 was more effective than BNT162b2 in veterans with >1 chronic disease. Conclusions: mRNA-1273 was more effective than BNT162b2 in older veterans and those with chronic diseases.

N2  - Background. A constellation of debilitating symptoms, known as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), has been described in those in those with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. While SARS-CoV-2 vaccination remains an effective way to prevent severe illness, PASC in individuals infected after vaccination is not well characterized. Methods. A cohort of adults with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled as cases and longitudinally followed between March 2020-March 2022 in the greater Seattle region. Demographic and acute illness surveys capturing baseline symptoms, infection severity and medical care were administered at enrollment (Table). Controls with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were concurrently followed. Symptom surveys were given at 6 months post-infection. Vaccination status was self-reported. We defined PASC as the presence of one or more symptoms that persisted for at least 4 weeks after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Table. Demographic and Illness Characteristics of Study Participants ∗Days since illness onset refers to the days passed since infection date. ∗ ∗Comorbidities included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, HIV, current use of immunosuppressants or diagnosis of cancer. Results. Of 369 cases and 93 controls 57% (median age 44.7 years; 59.3% female) and 30% (median age 50.0 years; 50.0% female), completed the 6-month survey, respectively (Table). A total of 174 cases were infected prior to vaccination and 35 were post-vaccination. A total of 58 (28%) cases reported symptoms at 6 months, compared to 5 (18%) controls (Figure). In participants infected pre-vaccination, 32% reported PASC symptoms, compared to 6% of those infected post-vaccination (Figure; P=0.001). Conclusion. Our study found that the proportion of individuals reporting PASC at 6 months after infection was significantly higher among those infected before SARS-CoV-2 vaccination than those who were infected after. This suggests that timing of vaccination relative to SARS-CoV-2 infection may be associated with the development of PASC symptoms. Symptoms were still reported among many individuals with PASC who were vaccinated after their infection. Further research is required to understand the underlying mechanisms of PASC, and to characterize PASC in those infected after vaccination and with variant of concerns.

N2  - Introduction: Mounting evidence suggests that B-cell depleting disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) may be associated with an increased risk of a moderate to severe COVID-19. Use of rituximab (RTX) is frequent in Sweden, a country that suffered high COVID-19 rates. Objective: To explore the association between timing and dose of RTX and risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 in a well-characterized cohort of MS patients. Methods: We included participants in COMBAT-MS, (NCT03193866) with ongoing treatment with RTX. Data include detailed demographic and clinical information, DMT exposure (date and dose of all RTX infusions), COVID-19 information (dates of infection and hospitalization as reported by the patient), as well as patient-reported outcomes. Among all persons who developed COVID-19, we measured the odds of hospitalization for COVID-19 as they related to 1) the time between most recent RTX infusion and COVID-19 onset date (measured in months), and 2) the total lifetime cumulative dose of RTX received (measured in grams), using logistic regression. The reference cohort included all persons with 'mild' COVID-19, not requiring hospitalization. Models were adjusted for age and sex with results reported as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Of 3391 persons actively enrolled in the COMBAT-MS cohort, 326 (9.6%) developed COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021. Amongst these patients, 172 (52.8%) were exposed to RTX prior to their COVID-19 onset, and 26 (15.1%) required hospitalization. No deaths occurred. Median time between last RTX infusion and COVID-19 onset was 6.1 months [interquartile range (IQR): 3.9, 11.0] among mild cases, and 4.6 months [IQR: 3.6, 5.6] among those hospitalized for COVID-19 (difference not significant, Mann-Whitney U-test p=0.16). Persons with mild COVID-19 had a median cumulative lifetime RTX dose of 3.5g [IQR: 2.5, 4.5], compared to 3.3g [IQR:2.6, 4.5] for hospitalized cases. The time between most recent DMT infusion and COVID-19 onset was not associated with altered odds of requiring hospitalization (age-and sexadjusted OR: 0.97 (95%CI: 0.90-1.03), nor was lifetime cumulative dose of RTX (age and sex-adjusted OR: 1.05 (95%CI: 0.83-1.31). Conclusions: Among COMBAT-MS participants who contracted COVID-19, there was no significant association between timing of RTX infusion nor cumulative lifetime RTX dose and the odds of hospitalization for COVID-19.

N2  - Introduction: COVID-19, one of the biggest disasters of this century did not spare the renal transplant recipients. Corticosteroids had been increasingly used during the second pandemic wave based on the RECOVERY trial and many such evidences suggesting the mortality benefit in moderate to severe COVID-19. Whether this data can be extrapolated to the immunosuppressed population like RTR’s is questionable as they are on long-term corticosteroids. The post-COVID infectious and non-infectious sequelae usually seen with severe COVID-19 has been well described in the general population but remains unevaluated in the transplant population. This study was conducted to analyze the short-term (4-week) and long-term (6-month) outcomes among the COVID-19 affected renal transplant recipients with reference to the use of high-dose corticosteroids. Methods: This single-center observational study included the RTRs admitted at COVID-care center between 25th March 2020 and 31st July 2021 during the two pandemic waves. Patients were categorized into mild, moderate and severe categories and were managed as per the ICMR protocol and the mortality during the initial hospitalization was assessed. The survivors were followed for minimum of 6 months and were studied for mortality, readmission rates, infectious and non-infectious sequelae. The results were compared between the patients with high-dose steroids and standard-dose steroid group. Appropriate statistical tools were used for the analysis. Results: A total of 251 RTRs, 104 during the first wave and 147 during the second wave, were treated during the study period. The mortality among the COVID-19 affected RTR’s during the initial hospitalization was 15.1% (11.5% during the first wave vs 17.5% during the second wave, p = 0.23). The use of high-dose steroids was also significantly higher among the non-survivors (85.8% vs 11.3%, p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, the severity of COVID-19, graft dysfunction, and high dose of corticosteroid therapy were associated with increased risk of death. The 6-month mortality (17.3% vs 0.5%, p < 0.001), readmission rate (91.3% vs 23.7%, p < 0.001), fungal infection rates (30.4% vs. 2.2% p < 0.001), post-COVID lung sequelae (21.7% vs. 4.4%, p = 0.008) were noticed in a significantly higher proportion of patients in the high-dose corticosteroid group than the standard-dose group. Conclusions: The use of the high-dose steroids in the RTR’s with COVID-19 was associated increased infectious, non-infectious complications with no mortality benefit seen even during the initial hospitalization. Hence, there is a need for a trial for standardizing the dose of steroids to prevent the inadvertent use of high-dose corticosteroids in this cohort. The non-infectious complications, including the rate of post-COVID lung sequelae and the graft rejection rates, are also to be looked for post-COVID. No conflict of interest

N2  - Background: COVID-19 is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with ESKD on chronic dialysis. Vaccination against other viruses is known to be less effective in these patients compared to the general population. Data on the titers of antibody following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in these patients is inconsistent. The efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to prevent severe disease in ESKD patients with COVID-19 remain unknown. We compared the incidence of hospitalization and COVID-19 related death after COVID-19 disease in dialysis patients based on SARSCoV- 2 vaccine status. Methods: Single-center, retrospective cohort study. We included all adults on dialysis (in-center and home) within the Mayo Clinic Health System in the Midwest (USA) with laboratory proven SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1/1/2020 and 3/30/2022 (n=225). Patients' demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory data including SARS-CoV2 infection test results, and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination information were collected. The primary outcome was the incidence of hospitalization and COVID-19 related death after COVID-19 disease. Results: 244 infections occurred in 225 patients, 119 (49%) were vaccinated and 8.4% (n=19) died. Among those who died, 73.7% (n=14) were not vaccinated compared to 49.3% of those who were alive (p=0.041). A total of 78 patients had 83 hospitalizations; 71.1% were not vaccinated compared to 41% not hospitalized (p<0.001) (Table). Conclusions: The incidence of hospitalization and COVID-19 related death after COVID-19 disease was significantly higher in non-vaccinated compared to vaccinated dialysis patients. This data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination improves outcomes in dialysis patients who develop COVID-19 disease. Table - Death and hospitalization in vaccinated and non-vaccinated dialysis patients a Total 244 infections. 18 patients had reinfection (1 with 2 reinfections and 17 with one reinfection). Among the 18 patients with reinfection, 2 died, 8 were not hospitalized, 4 were hospitalized after 1st COVID, and 5 were hospitalized after 2nd COVID. b Total 225 infections. c Among 78 patients.

N2  - Background: There are some concerns about the effectiveness of the inactivated and vector-based vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in real-world settings with the emergence of new mutations, especially variants of concern. Data derived from administrative repositories during mass vaccination campaigns or programs are of interest to study vaccine effectiveness. Methods: Using 4-repository administrative data linkage, we conducted a historical cohort study on a target population of 1 882 148 inhabitants aged at least 18 years residing in southern Iran. Results: We estimated a 71.9% [95% confidence interval [CI], 70.7%-73.1%], 81.5% [95% CI, 79.5%-83.4%], 67.5% [95% CI, 59.5%-75.6%], and 86.4% [95% CI, 84.1%-88.8%] hospital admission reduction for those who received the full vaccination schedule of BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm), ChAdOx1-S/nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222, Oxford-AstraZeneca), rAd26-rAd5 (Gam-COVID-Vac, Sputnik V), and BIV1-CovIran (COVIran Barekat) vaccines, respectively. A high reduction in mortality (at least 85%) was observed in all age subgroups of the fully immunized population. Conclusions: The pragmatic implementation of a vaccination plan including all available vaccine options in the Iranian population was associated with a significant reduction in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) detected infections as well as hospital admissions and deaths associated with COVID-19.

N2  - Patients with multiple myeloma (MM), an age-dependent neoplasm of antibody-producing plasma cells, have compromised immune systems and might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes. This study characterizes risk factors associated with clinical indicators of COVID-19 severity and all-cause mortality in myeloma patients utilizing NCATS' National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) database. The N3C consortium is a large, centralized data resource representing the largest multi-center cohort of COVID-19 cases and controls nationwide (>16 million total patients, and >6 million confirmed COVID-19+ cases to date). Our cohort included myeloma patients (both inpatients and outpatients) within the N3C consortium who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 based on positive PCR or antigen tests or ICD-10-CM diagnosis code. The outcomes of interest include all-cause mortality (including discharge to hospice) during the index encounter and clinical indicators of severity (i.e., hospitalization/emergency department/ED visit, use of mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)). Finally, causal inference analysis was performed using the propensity score matching (PSM) method. As of 05/16/2022, the N3C consortium included 1,061,748 cancer patients, out of which 26,064 were MM patients (8,588 were COVID-19 positive). The mean age at COVID-19 diagnosis was 65.89 years, 46.8% were females, and 20.2% were of black race. 4.47% of patients died within 30 days of COVID-19 hospitalization. Overall, the survival probability was 90.7% across the course of the study. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed histories of pulmonary and renal disease, dexamethasone, proteasome inhibitor/PI, immunomodulatory/IMiD therapies, and severe Charlson Comorbidity Index/CCI were significantly associated with higher risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Protective associations were observed with blood-or-marrow transplant/BMT and COVID-19 vaccination. Further, multivariate cox proportional hazard analysis showed that high and moderate CCI levels, International Staging System (ISS) moderate or severe stage, and PI therapy were associated with worse survival, while BMT and COVID-19 vaccination were associated with lower risk of death. Finally, matched sample average treatment effect on the treated (SATT) confirmed the causal effect of BMT and vaccination status as top protective factors associated with COVID-19 risk among US patients suffering from multiple myeloma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest nationwide study on myeloma patients with COVID-19.

N2  - Background: It is important to understand how BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and JNJ-78436735 COVID-19 vaccines, as well as prior infection, protect against breakthrough cases and reinfections. Real world evidence on acquired immunity from vaccines, and from SARS-CoV-2 infection, can help public health decision-makers understand disease dynamics and viral escape to inform resource allocation for curbing the spread of pandemic. Methods: This retrospective cohort study presents demographic information, survival functions, and probability distributions for 2,627,914 patients who received recommended doses of COVID-19 vaccines, and 63,691 patients who had a prior COVID-19 infection. In addition, patients receiving different vaccines were matched by age, sex, ethnic group, state of residency, and the quarter of the year in 2021 the COVID-19 vaccine was completed, to support survival analysis on pairwise matched cohorts. Findings: Each of the three vaccines and infection-induced immunity all showed a high probability of survival against breakthrough or reinfection cases (mRNA-1273: 0.997, BNT162b2: 0.997, JNJ-78436735: 0.992, previous infection: 0.965 at 180 days). The incidence rate of reinfection among those unvaccinated and previously infected was higher than that of breakthrough among the vaccinated population (reinfection: 0.9%; breakthrough:0.4%). In addition, 280 vaccinated patients died (0.01% all-cause mortality) within 21 days of the last vaccine dose, and 5898 (3.1 %) died within 21 days of a positive COVID-19 test. Conclusions: Despite a gradual decline in vaccine-induced and infection-induced immunity, both acquired immunities were highly effective in preventing breakthrough and reinfection. In addition, for unvaccinated patients with COVID-19, those who did not die within 90 days of their initial infection (9565 deaths, 5.0% all-cause mortality rate), had a comparable asymptotic pattern of breakthrough infection as those who acquired immunity from a vaccine. Overall, the risks associated with COVID-19 infection are far greater than the marginal advantages of immunity acquired by prior infection.

N2  - Background We aimed to explore the effectiveness of one-dose BNT162b2 vaccination upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, its effect on COVID-19 presentation, and post-vaccination symptoms in children and young people (CYP) in the UK during periods of Delta and Omicron variant predominance. Methods In this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we analysed data from 115,775 CYP aged 12-17 years, proxy-reported through the Covid Symptom Study (CSS) smartphone application. We calculated post-vaccination infection risk after one dose of BNT162b2, and described the illness profile of CYP with post-vaccination SARSCoV-2 infection, compared to unvaccinated CYP, and post-vaccination side-effects. Findings Between August 5, 2021 and February 14, 2022, 25,971 UK CYP aged 12-17 years received one dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. Vaccination reduced (proxy-reported) infection risk (-80·4% and -53·7% at 14–30 days with Delta and Omicron variants respectively, and -61·5% and -63·7% after 61–90 days). The probability of remaining infection-free diverged soon after vaccination, and was greater in CYP with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccinated CYP who contracted SARS-CoV-2 during the Delta period had milder disease than unvaccinated CYP; during the Omicron period this was only evident in children aged 12-15 years. Overall disease profile was similar in both vaccinated and unvaccinated CYP. Post-vaccination local side-effects were common, systemic side-effects were uncommon, and both resolved quickly. Interpretation One dose of BNT162b2 vaccine reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for at least 90 days in CYP aged 12-17 years. Vaccine protection varied for SARS-CoV-2 variant type (lower for Omicron than Delta variant), and was enhanced by pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severity of COVID-19 presentation after vaccination was generally milder, although unvaccinated CYP also had generally mild disease. Overall, vaccination was well-tolerated.

N2  - TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Original Investigations PURPOSE: Dexamethasone has become the standard of care for treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who require oxygen. This therapeutic regiment has been found to decrease mortality in patients with COVID-19. The RECOVERY trial proposed utilizing dexamethasone at 6 mg daily, but some feel this dose is not high enough to ameliorate the cytokine storm in patients. Studies like DEXA-ARDS have utilized higher doses of dexamethasone (20 mg IV daily) found patients to have accelerated from the ventilator and more ventilator free days. Despite the increasing evidence of the effectiveness of corticosteroids for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19, the optimal dose of dexamethasone is not clearly stablished. We sought out to compare a low-dose dexamethasone against a high-dose of dexamethasone in patients admitted with COVID-19 to our tertiary hospital in Honduras. METHODS: We conducted a single center a randomized non-blinded control trial pilot study of COVID-19 patients admitted between September 1st 2020 to October 31st2020. Patients were randomly assigned to be treated with low-dose dexamethasone (control) 8mg/day (n=40) and high-dose dexamethasone (experimental) 24mg/day. The primary outcome was the reduction in mortality and intubation. Our Secondary outcomes included nosocomial infections, superinfections and prolonged hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 81 patients underwent randomization, with 40 in the low-dose group and 41 in the high-dose group. On the low-dose n=17 (42.5%) were male and n=23 (57.5%) were females vs the high-dose n=29(70.7%) were males and n=12(29.3%) were females. Patient’s were similarly matched in age, with (mean +/-SD) of 56.9 +/- 14.9 and 57.5+/-16.5 for low and high-dose dexamethasone respectively. Oxygen saturation on admission was 77.8% in the high-dose vs 82.5% in the low-dose group. C reactive protein (CRP) mean value was 52.8 mg/L in low-dose vs 79.65 in the high-dose. Patients in the high-dose group developed more nosocomial infections (19.5% (n=8)) compared to their low-dose counterparts (12.5% (n=5)). Patients in the high dose group were more likely to become more critically ill (53.7% (n=22)) than their low-dose peers (27.5% (n=11)). The risk of becoming critically ill and requiring intubation was near 2-fold higher in the high-dose as opposed to the low dose group RR=1.95 (95% CI 1.1-3.5). A total of 8 patients died, with 6 of these patients being in the high-dose group. CONCLUSIONS: High dose of dexamethasone was associated with increased mortality, risk of intubation and nosocomial infections. It is likely that patients who were enrolled in the high-dose corticosteroid group were sicker, as evidenced by the higher CRP levels and low SpO2 on admission in this cohort. Our study is limited by a small sample size but the findings remain significant as this is the only randomized trial looking at differences between high and low doses of dexamethasone in a LMIC. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Low dose treatment showed increase in survival and better clinical outcomes. High-dose steroid use should be avoided. These findings can help guide clinical decision in LMIC were immunomodulation with monoclonal antibodies might not be feasible due to cost prohibition.

N2  - (1) Background: The development of effective COVID-19 vaccines has reduced the impact of COVID-19 on the general population. Our study aims to analyze how vaccination modifies the likelihood of death and length of stay in hospitalized patients with COVID-19; (2) Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 1927 hospitalized patients infected with COVID-19 was conducted. Information was gathered on vaccination status, hospitalization episode, and clinical profile of the patients. The effect of vaccination on mortality was analyzed using a multiple logistic regression model, and length of stay was analyzed using linear regression. The performance and fit of the models were evaluated; (3) Results: In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the risk of dying during admission in vaccinated patients was half that of non-vaccinated (OR: 0.45; CI 95%: 0.25 to 0.84). In patients who were discharged due to improvement, the reduction in hospital stay in vaccinated patients was 3.17 days (CI 95%: 5.88 to 0.47); (4) Conclusions: Patients who, despite having been vaccinated, acquire the infection by SARS-CoV-2, have a significant reduction of the risk of death during admission and a reduction of hospital stay compared with unvaccinated patients.

N2  - Background: Methotrexate (MTX) is an antimetabolite, that mainly acts through the inhibition of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase and the subsequent depletion of intracellular folate stores. High-dose MTX (HDMTX)is defined by the dose of more than 1 g/m2. The utilization of HDMTX is commonly used in solid malignancies such as osteosarcoma and hematological malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Urine Alkalinization using intravenous sodium bicarbonate and calcium folinate to facilitate clearance of MTX are crucial two steps in MTX clearance and to avoid or minimize side effects such as nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. For that reason, most institutions are requiring patients to be admitted with a minimum length of stay of 72 hours until methotrexate clearance is achieved with a serum level of < 0.1 micromol/L. Aims: Here, we are assessing the safety of ambulatory HDMTX among adult patients. Regular laboratory monitoring, adequate oral hydration and oral medications were utilized to enhance methotrexate clearance without the necessity to use devices at home for infusion or admitting the patient Methods: This trial is open-labeled, single arm study that aims to evaluate the safety of high dose methotrexate administration in an outpatient setting among adult patients with hematological malignancies in a tertiary care center. The study aims to cover a cohort of patients with hematological malignancies from 14 to 60-years-old treated at KFMC scheduled to receive HDMTX from (February-2020) to (February-2021). treatment protocol is showing in figure 1. Results: Twenty-seven (n=27) cycles were done until now. Around 70.37% of the patients were diagnosed with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Thirteen patients (48.1) % of the patients achieved MTX level less than 0.1 micromol/L by 48 hours and 24 patients (88.8%) achieved the same level by 72 hours. Only three (11.1%) patients did not clear their methotrexate by the end of 72 hours; one patient was admitted due to acute kidney injury, the second was managed as outpatient as that occurred at the mid of COVID- 19 bed crises, and the third one refused admission and was following his labs at the hospital at his hometown. By 72 hours, 29.63% had reversible asymptomatic elevation of creatinine, and all of them were grade one. By 72 hours, around 44.44% had reversible asymptomatic hepatotoxicity, and all of them were grade 1. Among the 27 patients, only one suffered from acute kidney injury that necessitated admission for supportive care, which was totally reversible. The patient was not compliant to the treatment protocol and was excluded for subsequent cycles. Summary/Conclusion: Our preliminary results suggest that ambulatory HDMTX is safe, cost effective, more comfortable for patients. These results encourage the use of this approach more frequently as it decreases hospitalization and thus reduces cost, increases patient satisfaction and helps to solve the issue of bed crisis.

N2  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a respiratory disease called coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 in infected individuals. Since its first outbreak at the end of 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic and has infected more than 85 million (M) people worldwide and has resulted in over 1.85 M deaths. The pandemic has led to the race for finding therapeutics and vaccines, and to date, there have been two vaccines approved within the United States and the potential for more to follow in the coming months. In addition, this has also forced clinical researchers to look into the impact this may have on ongoing trials, given the risk of COVIDrelated complications confounding with the efficacy and safety outcomes and necessitating the collection of additional data and evaluating alternate ways of analyzing trial results. This is of particular concern in patients with cancer who are often immunosuppressed as a result of both their disease and the treatment they receive, which puts them at increased risk of severe complications from COVID-19. In this session, we will focus on two important but very distinct topics that have emerged due to the onset of the pandemic: (1) the issues and challenges related to vaccine development including trial design, rapid execution, real-time regulatory feedback, and overall interpretation of trial results and (2) understanding potential impact of COVID-related deaths in Oncology trials, on time to event endpoints of overall survival and progression-free survival. Topic 1: Challenges with COVID-19 Vaccine development The SARS-CoV-2, first identified in December 2019, has caused a worldwide pandemic leading to widespread morbidity and mortality. There was no Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccine for the prevention of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The urgent need for safe and effective interventions to mitigate the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has prompted international efforts to develop antivirals and vaccines. Numerous vaccine candidates based on traditional and new platforms are currently being evaluated including nucleic acid (DNA and RNA), viral vector (replicating and non-replicating), virus-like particles, peptide-based, recombinant protein, and live attenuated and inactivated virus modalities. COVID-19 vaccines are in various stages of clinical development, with several candidates in pivotal phase 3 clinical trials, including mRNA-based vaccines, of which two vaccines, one developed by Pfizer and the other by Moderna recently received the emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration in December 2020. In this session, we will share experiences and challenges in the development of these two vaccines. We will share the practical and statistical challenges and considerations when designing COVID-19 vaccine studies, such as target population(s), endpoint selection and assessment, statistical analysis method, timing of interim analyses, and questions continuously to be answered after receiving the emergency use authorization and/or during the Biologics License Application review. We show that, when planning a vaccine pivotal study against a novel virus causing ongoing worldwide pandemic, special consideration needs to be given for the designing of interim analyses related to efficacy, so that a vaccine with favorable benefit-risk profile can be made available as early as possible; special attention also needs to be given for an independent data safety monitoring board for vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease and other safety signal monitoring to mitigate the risk for trial participants during an ongoing pandemic. Topic 2: Impact of COVID-19 on Oncology trial outcomes using overall survival or progression-free survival Simulations were conducted to assess (1) the impact of the COVID-19-related death and (2) missed RECIST visits on the statistical analysis of time-to-event outcomes in randomized phase 3 oncology trials and explore mitigation options for this risk when COVID- 19 cohort is well-defined. Two simulated case studies of Phase 3 randomized controlled trials ongoing during the pandemic outbreak were used to evaluate five approaches (1, ITT approach; 2, modified ITT excluding COVID-19-related deaths; 3, censoring COVID-19- related deaths with target number of non-COVID-19- related deaths; 4, censoring COVID-19-related deaths with original date-cut-off; 5, Fine & Gray modeling of competing risk approach to treat COVID-19-related death and non-COVID-19-related death separately), at presence of COVID-19-related deaths with different pandemic onsets relative to timing of analysis and varying pandemic durations, the impact of COVID-19- related death due to pandemic, on the primary endpoints of overall survival and/or progression-free survival in terms of type 1 error, power, and hazard ratio estimates. It was found that COVID-19-related deaths would impact time-to-event analysis in terms of type 1 error and power for log rank test, and provide biased treatment effect estimation from Cox model if ITT approach is used; impact would be more severe if there was an imbalance in COVID-19-related deaths mainly in experimental arm. With same number of COVID-19- related deaths, the earlier the timing of the pandemic window, will lead to greater loss in power. Approaches censoring COVID-19-related deaths would minimize impact on power loss and bias in hazard ratio estimation, particularly if data cut-off was extended to mitigate for events loss due to censoring. The simulations conducted in this analysis provide a framework to help understand how to mitigate the risk to the randomized oncology trials in which COVID-19- related deaths are observed in the blinded assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - We estimated the effectiveness of two doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Covishield) vaccine against any COVID-19 infection among individuals ≥45 years in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. A community-based cohort study was conducted from May to September 2021 in a selected geographic area in Chennai. The estimated sample size was 10,232. We enrolled 69,435 individuals, of which 21,793 were above 45 years. Two-dose coverage of Covishield in the 18+ and 45+ age group was 18% and 31%, respectively. Genomic analysis of 74 out of the 90 aliquots collected from the 303 COVID-19positive individuals in the 45+ age group showed delta variants and their sub-lineages. The vaccine’s effectiveness against COVID-19 disease in the ≥45 age group was 61.3% (95% CI: 43.6–73.4) at least 2 weeks after receiving the second dose of Covishield. We demonstrated the effectiveness of two doses of the ChAdOx1 vaccine against the delta variant in the general population of Chennai. We recommend similar future studies considering emerging variants and newer vaccines. Two-dose vaccine coverage could be ensured to protect against COVID-19 infection.

N2  - Background: India experienced the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2021, driven by the delta variant. Apprehensions around the usefulness of vaccines against delta variant posed a risk to the vaccination program. Therefore, we estimated the effectiveness of two doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Covishield) vaccine against COVID-19 infection among individuals ≥45 years in Chennai, India. Methods: A community-based cohort study was conducted from May to September 2021 in a selected geographic area in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The estimated sample size was 10,232. We enumerated individuals from all eligible households and periodically updated vaccination and COVID-19 infection data. We computed vaccine effectiveness with its 95% confidence interval for two doses of the Covishield vaccine against any COVID-19 infection. Results: We enrolled 69,435 individuals, of which 21,793 were above 45 years. Two dose coverage of Covishield in the 18+ and 45+ age group was 18% and 31%, respectively. The overall incidence of COVID-19 infection was 1099 per 100,000 population. The vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 disease in the ≥45 age group was 61.3% (95% CI: 43.6 - 73.4) at least two weeks after receiving the second dose of Covishield. Genomic analysis of 74 (28 with two doses, 15 with one dose, and 31 with zero dose) out of the 90 aliquots collected from the 303 COVID-19 positive individuals in the 45+ age group showed delta variants and their sub-lineages. Conclusion: We demonstrated the effectiveness of two doses of the ChAdOx1 vaccine against the delta variant in the general population of Chennai. We recommend similar future studies considering emerging variants and newer vaccines. Two-dose vaccine coverage could be ensured to protect against COVID-19 infection.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the benefits of vaccination on the case fatality rate (CFR) for COVID-19 infections. Design: Multivariate modeling of data from electronic medical records Setting: 130 medical centers of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs Participants: 339,772 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by nucleic acid amplification testing as of September 30, 2021 Methods: The primary outcome was death within 60 days of the diagnosis. Patients were considered vaccinated if they had completed a full series >= 14 days prior to diagnosis. Cases presenting in July - September of 2021 were considered to have the delta variant. Logistic regression was used to derive adjusted odds ratios (OR) for vaccination and infection with delta versus earlier variants. Models were adjusted for demographic traits, standard comorbidity indices, selected clinical terms, and 3 novel parameters representing all prior diagnoses, all prior vital signs/baseline laboratory tests, and current outpatient treatment. Patients with a delta infection were divided into 8 cohorts based upon the time from vaccination to diagnosis (in 4-week blocks). A common model was used to estimate the odds of death associated with vaccination for each cohort relative that of all unvaccinated patients. Results: 9.1% of subjects had been fully vaccinated, and 21.5% were presumed to have the delta variant. 18,120 patients (5.33%) died within 60 days of their diagnoses. The adjusted OR for delta infection was 1.87 +/- 0.05 which corresponds to a relative risk of 1.78. The overall adjusted OR for prior vaccination was 0.280 +/- 0.011 corresponding to a relative risk of 0.291. The study of vaccine cohorts with a delta infection showed that the raw CFR rose steadily after 10-14 weeks. However, the OR for vaccination remained stable for 10-34 weeks. Conclusions: Our study confirms that delta is substantially more lethal than earlier variants and that vaccination is an effective means of preventing COVID death. After adjusting for major selection biases, we found no evidence that the benefits of vaccination on CFR declined over 34 weeks.

N2  - Introduction/ Background: In response to the pandemic, multiple vaccines to protect against COVID-19 disease have been unrivalled in the history of public health. Precise estimates of vaccine effectiveness (VE) vary according to studies design, outcomes measured and circulating variants. The aim of this study is to evaluate the anti-covid-19 vaccine effectiveness in Tunisia. Methods: We conducted a matched case-control study from 02 to 15 August 2021. Cases and controls were subjects older than 60 years, selected from the database of testing at the National Observatory of New and Emerging Diseases, regardless vaccine status. A sample of 977 matched peers for age and gender were included. A standardized questionnaire was administered for cases and controls to collect information about vaccination status. The odds-ratio was calculated using simple conditional logistic regression. The VE (95% confidence intervals) was calculated as (1 - odds ratio for vaccination) × 100%. Results: The vaccine effectiveness was 84.2% (95%CI [70.3%- 97.2%]). In our sample, 68.1% of the male population and 56.4% of the female population were vaccinated with a vaccine effectiveness of 84.2% (95%CI [63.2%- 96.3%]) for men and 86.3% (95%CI [68.1%-95.7%]) for women. Vaccine Effectiveness was the highest among age group [60-70[ years 88.0% (95%CI [68.9%-91.5%]). Vaccine effectiveness in prevention from severe forms (treated with oxygen-therapy or necessity of Intensive-care-unit) was 94.5% IC [72.2%-96.3%]. Impact: Our study aims to strengthen anti-covid-19 vaccination efforts as it reduces the spread of the disease (including infection without symptoms) and helps protect from severe forms including hospitalization and death. Difference estimates (depending on the unvaccinated group absolute incidence) provide further evidence of the possible public health value of vaccines. Conclusion: The results of our study imply that the anti-Covid-19 vaccines used in Tunisia are effective in preventing SARS-COV-2 infections and severe forms of COVID-19. This study provided important data on the 'realworld' performance of vaccines that guide decisions about vaccine sustained use.

N2  - Background: The persisting Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and limited vaccine supply has led to a shift in global health priorities to expand vaccine coverage. Relying on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) molecular testing alone cannot reveal the infection proportion, which could play a critical role in vaccination prioritization. We evaluated the utility of a combination orthogonal serological testing (COST) algorithm alongside RT-PCR to quantify prevalence with the aim of identifying candidate patient clusters to receive single and/or delayed vaccination. Methods: We utilized 108,505 patients with suspected COVID-19 in a retrospective analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR vs. IgG-nucleocapsid (IgGNC) antibody testing coverage in routine practice for the estimation of prevalence. Prospectively, an independent cohort of 21,388 subjects was simultaneously tested by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and IgGNC to determine the prevalence. We used 614 prospective study subjects to assess the utility of COST (IgGNC, IgM-spike (IgMSP), and IgG-spike (IgGSP)) in establishing the infection proportion to identify a single-dose vaccination cohort. Results: Retrospectively, we observed a 6.3% (6871/108,505) positivity for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, and only 2.3% (2533/108,505) of cases had paired IgGNC serology performed. Prospectively, IgGNC serology identified twice the number of COVID-positive cases in relation to RT-PCR alone. COST further increased the number of detected positive cases: IgGNC+ or IgMSP+ (18.0%); IgGNC+ or IgGSP+ (23.5%); IgMSP+ or IgGSP+ (23.8%); and IgGNC+ or IgMSP+ or IgGSP+ (141/584 = 24.1%). Conclusion: COST may be an effective tool for the evaluation of infection proportion and thus could define a cohort for a single dose and/or delayed vaccination.

N2  - Background: Impact of the Delta variant and vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains unclear. In Singapore, quarantine of all close contacts, including entry and exit PCR testing, provided the opportunity to determine risk of infection by the Delta variant compared to other variants, vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, symptomatic or severe COVID-19, and risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and symptomatic disease. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included all close contacts between September 1, 2020 and May 31, 2021. Regardless of symptoms, all were quarantined for 14 days with entry and exit PCR testing. Household contacts were defined as individuals who shared a residence with a Covid-19 index case. Secondary attack rates among household close contacts of Delta variant-infected indexes and other variant-infected indexes were derived from prevalence of diagnosed cases among contacts. Relative risk ratios and bootstrapping at the cluster level was used to determine risk of infection by the Delta variant compared to other variants and vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, symptomatic or severe COVID-19. Logistic regression using generalized estimating equations was used to determine risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and symptomatic disease Findings: Of 1024 household contacts linked to 301 PCR-confirmed index cases, 753 (73.5%) were linked to Delta-infected indexes and 248 (24.2%) were exposed to indexes with other variants. Household secondary attack rate among unvaccinated Delta-exposed contacts was 25.8% (95% boostrap confidence interval [BCI] 20.6–31.5%) compared with 12.9% (95%BCI 7.0–20.0%) among other variant-exposed contacts. Unvaccinated Delta-exposed contacts were more likely to be infected than those exposed to other variants (Relative risk 2.01, 95%CI 1.24–3.84). Among Delta-exposed contacts, complete vaccination had a vaccine effectiveness of 56.4% (95%BCI 32.6–75.8%) against acquisition, 64.1% (95%BCI 37.8–85.4%) against symptomatic disease and 100% against severe disease. Among Delta-exposed contacts, vaccination status (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.33, 95% robust confidence interval [RCI] 0.17–0.63) and older age of the index (aOR 1.20 per decade, 95%RCI 1.03–1.39) was associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition by the contact. Vaccination status of the index was not associated with a statistically-significant difference for contact SARS-CoV-2 acquisition (aOR 0.73, 95%RCI 0.38–1.40). Interpretation: Increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 Delta acquisition compared with other variants was reduced with vaccination. Close-contacts of vaccinated Delta-infected indexes did not have statistically significant reduced risk of acquisition compared with unvaccinated Delta-infected indexes.

N2  - Importance The Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant has increased SARs-CoV-2 infections in double vaccinated individuals globally, particularly in ChAdOx1 recipients. To tackle rising infections, the UK accelerated booster vaccination programmes used mRNA vaccines irrespective of an individual's primary course vaccine type with booster doses rolled out according to clinical priority. There is limited understanding of the effectiveness of different primary vaccination courses on mRNA based booster vaccines against SARs-COV-2 infections and how time-varying confounders can impact the evaluations comparing different vaccines as primary courses for mRNA boosters. Objective To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of ChAdOx1 versus BNT162b2 as primary doses against SARs-CoV-2 in booster vaccine recipients whilst accounting for time-varying confounders. Design Trial emulation was used to reduce time-varying confounding-by-indication driven by prioritising booster vaccines based upon age, vulnerability and exposure status e.g. healthcare worker. Trial emulation was conducted by meta-analysing eight cohort results whose booster vaccinations were staggered between 16/09/2021 to 05/01/2022 and followed until 23/01/2022. Time from booster vaccination until SARS-CoV-2 infection, loss of follow-up or end-of-study was modelled using Cox proportional hazards models for each cohort and adjusted for age, sex, minority ethnic status, clinically vulnerability, and deprivation. Setting Prospective observational study using the Virus Watch community cohort in England and Wales. Participants People over the age of 18 years who had their booster vaccination between 16/09/2021 to 05/01/2022 without prior natural immunity. Exposures ChAdOx1 versus BNT162b2 as a primary dose, and an mRNA booster vaccine. Results Across eight cohorts, 19,692 mRNA vaccine boosted participants were analysed with 12,036 ChAdOx1 and 7,656 BNT162b2 primary courses with a median follow-up time of 73 days (IQR:54-90). Median age, clinical vulnerability status and infection rates fluctuate through time. 7.2% (n=864) of boosted adults with ChAdOx1 primary course experienced a SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to 7.6% (n=582) of those with BNT162b2 primary course during follow-up. The pooled adjusted hazard ratio was 0.99 [95%CI:0.88-1.11], demonstrating no difference between the incidence of SARs-CoV-2 infections based upon the primary vaccine course. Conclusion and Relevance In mRNA boosted individuals, we found no difference in protection comparing those with a primary course of BNT162b2 to those with aChAdOx1 primary course. This contrasts with pre-booster findings where previous research shows greater effectiveness of BNT162b2 than ChAdOx1 in preventing infection.

N2  - Introduction: Individuals with a prior severe acute respiratory corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have a moderate to high degree of protection against reinfection, though seemingly less so when the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 started to circulate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, that is, in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, during periods with different dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants. Methods: A nationwide cohort study design including all individuals with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, who were alive and residing in Denmark between 1 January 2020 and 31 January 2022 were used. Using Danish nationwide registries, we obtained information on SARS-CoV-2 infections, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination, age, sex, comorbidity, staying at hospital and region of affiliation. The study population included were individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Crude and adjusted estimates of VE against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Poisson and Cox regression models, respectively. The VE estimates were calculated separately for three periods with different dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants (Alpha (B.1.1.7), Delta (B.1.617.2), or Omicron (B.1.1.529)) and by time since vaccination using unvaccinated as the reference. Findings: The study population comprised of 209,814 individuals infected before or during the Alpha period, 292,978 before or during the Delta period and 245,530 before or during the Omicron period. Of these, 40,281 individuals had completed their primary vaccination series during the Alpha period (19.2%), 190,026 during the Delta period (64.9%) and 158,563 during the Omicron period (64.6%). VE against reinfection following any COVID-19 vaccine type administered in Denmark, peaked at 85% (95% CI: 37% to 97%) at 104 days or more after vaccination during the Alpha period, 88% (95% CI: 81% to 92%) 14-43 days after vaccination during the Delta period and 60% (95% CI: 58% to 62%) 14-43 days after vaccination during the Omicron period. Waning immunity was observed, and was most pronounced during the Omicron period. Interpretation: This study shows that, in previously infected individuals, completing a primary vaccination series was associated with a significant protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection compared with no vaccination for all three variant periods. Even though vaccination seems to protect to a lesser degree against reinfection with the Omicron variant, these findings are of public health relevance as they show that previously infected individuals still benefit from COVID-19 vaccination in all three variant periods.

N2  - Introduction: Real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates are essential to identify potential groups at higher risk of break-through infections and to guide policy. We assessed the VE of COVID-19 vaccination against COVID-19 hospitalization, while adjusting and stratifying for patient characteristics. Methods: We performed a test-negative case-control study in six Dutch hospitals. The study population consisted of adults eligible for COVID-19 vaccination hospitalized between May 1 and June 28 2021 with respiratory symptoms. Cases were defined as patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR during the first 48 hours of admission or within 14 days prior to hospital admission. Controls were patients tested negative at admission and did not have a positive test during the 2 weeks prior to hospitalization. VE was calculated using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for calendar week, sex, age, comorbidity and nursing home residency. Subgroup analysis was performed for age, sex and different comorbidities. Secondary endpoints were ICU-admission and mortality. Results: 379 cases and 255 controls were included of whom 157 (18%) were vaccinated prior to admission. Five cases (1%) and 40 controls (16%) were fully vaccinated (VE: 93%; 95% CI: 81 – 98), and 40 cases (11%) and 70 controls (27%) were partially vaccinated (VE: 70%; 95% CI: 50-82). A strongly protective effect of vaccination was found in all comorbidity subgroups. No ICU-admission or mortality were reported among fully vaccinated cases. Of unvaccinated cases, mortality was 10% and 19% was admitted at the ICU Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccination provides a strong protective effect against COVID-19 related hospital admission, in patients with and without comorbidity.

N2  - Introduction: COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019], caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2], has emerged as a pandemic. Patients with chronic kidney disease stage-5 (CKD-5) on the maintenance of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) are a special population, needing recurrent visits to their dialysis facility. These numerous visits potentially confer risks of increased exposure to infected persons, despite the use of standard preventive measures, PPE, hand washing, social distancing, and isolation in the absence of a vaccine. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is implicated as the main cytokine in the COVID-19 lung injury. Colchicine an IL-6 inhibitor has been proven in randomized control trials to be effective for COVID-19 therapy. Colchicine has also be been extensively used in the prophylaxis of Familial Mediterranean fever and acute symptomatic gout with success as an anti-inflammatory drug due to its IL-6 inhibition. This study was done to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low dose colchicine as a prophylactic agent to prevent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection by inhibiting IL-6 in CKD-5 patients on maintenance KRT. Methods: Sixty patients with mean age 58 years, 80% males and dialysis vintage 14.4 months, on KRT at three hemodialysis centers spread across Rwanda were studied. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and all data documented. All patients were administered 0.5mg of colchicine by a nurse from 4th or 5th June 2020, while on dialysis thrice weekly, on Monday, Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday respectively and no loading dose was administered. This dose was chosen based on the available evidence in the literature. No travel history of patients or household were present. The co-morbidity analysis revealed the presence of Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (40.8%), Hypertension (93.5%), coronary artery disease (1.8%) with no patients having any form of stroke or chronic lung disease. Results: Available investigations reveal a mean (and interquartile range) as follows; hemoglobin 9.9(2.6)gm%, WBC count-3300(3370) cells/cm3, platelets 208,787 (96,500)/mm3, creatinine 660.5 (448) umols/l and albumin 36.4 ( 7.0) gm/dl. None of the patients had any symptoms of COVID at any point in time. All patients were continued on colchicine today (26th November 2020) with none of the patients having any clinical evidence of COVID-19. None of the patients reported any untoward effects of colchicine therapy such as diarrhea or muscle pain with the low dose thrice-weekly colchicine administration. Conclusions: Prophylactic use of low dose colchicine in the prevention of symptomatic COVID shows great promise with none of the CKD-5 patients on KRT studied developing clinical COVID while on therapy and needs well-designed randomized control trials. No conflict of interest

N2  - Background Real-world evidence on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination against severe disease caused by the omicron variant among adolescents is sparse. In addition, evidence on risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease, and whether vaccination is similarly effective in such risk groups, is unclear. Methods and findings Nationwide registers were used to examine the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination against COVID-19 hospitalisation, and risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalisation in adolescents. The safety analysis included all individuals in Sweden born between 2003-2009 (aged 11.3-19.2 years) given at least one dose of mRNA vaccine (N=645,355), and never vaccinated controls (N=199,022). Outcomes evaluated included all hospitalisations until 5 June 2022. The vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 hospitalisation and associated risk factors was evaluated in adolescents given two doses of mRNA vaccine (N=501,945), as compared to never vaccinated controls (N=170,083), during an omicron predominant period (1 January 2022 to 5 June 2022). The safety analysis showed that COVID-19 mRNA vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of any serious adverse events resulting in hospitalisation. During follow-up, 1.69% of the vaccinated individuals were hospitalised compared to 1.71% of the controls (P=0.29). In the VE analysis, there were 21 cases (0.004%) of COVID-19 hospitalisation among 2-dose recipients and 26 cases (0.015%) among controls, resulting in an estimated VE of 75% (95% CI, 54-86, P<0.001). Strong risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalisation included previous infections (odds ratio [OR], 14.3, 95% CI, 7.7-26.6, P<0.001), and cerebral palsy/development disorders (OR, 12.0, 95% CI, 6.4-22.6, P<0.001), with similar estimates of VE in these subgroups as in the total cohort. The number needed to vaccinate with two doses to prevent one case of COVID-19 hospitalisation was 9,007 in the total cohort and 1,031 in those with previous infections or developmental disorders. None of the individuals hospitalised due to COVID-19 died within 30 days. Conclusions In this nationwide study, COVID-19 mRNA vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of any serious adverse event in adolescents. Two doses were associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation during the omicron predominant period, especially among those with certain predisposing conditions who should be prioritized for vaccination. However, COVID-19 hospitalisation among general adolescents was extremely rare, and additional doses in this population may not be warranted at this stage.

N2  - BACKGROUND The increasing incidence of pediatric hospitalizations associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) caused by the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the United States has offered an opportunity to assess the real-world effectiveness of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccine in adolescents between 12 and 18 years of age. METHODS We used a case-control, test-negative design to assess vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19 resulting in hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of life-supporting interventions (mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), or death. Between July 1 and October 25, 2021, we screened admission logs for eligible case patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 at 31 hospitals in 23 states. We estimated vaccine effectiveness by comparing the odds of antecedent full vaccination (two doses of BNT162b2) in case patients as compared with two hospital-based control groups: patients who had Covid-19-like symptoms but negative results on testing for SARS-CoV-2 (test-negative) and patients who did not have Covid-19-like symptoms (syndrome-negative). RESULTS A total of 445 case patients and 777 controls were enrolled. Overall, 17 case patients (4%) and 282 controls (36%) had been fully vaccinated. Of the case patients, 180 (40%) were admitted to the ICU, and 127 (29%) required life support; only 2 patients in the ICU had been fully vaccinated. The overall effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine against hospitalization for Covid-19 was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90 to 96); the effectiveness was 95% (95% CI, 91 to 97) among test-negative controls and 94% (95% CI, 89 to 96) among syndrome-negative controls. The effectiveness was 98% against ICU admission and 98% against Covid-19 resulting in the receipt of life support. All 7 deaths occurred in patients who were unvaccinated. CONCLUSIONS Among hospitalized adolescent patients, two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine were highly effective against Covid-19-related hospitalization and ICU admission or the receipt of life support.

N2  - Importance Randomized clinical trials and observational studies have demonstrated high overall effectiveness for the three US-authorized COVID-19 vaccines against symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Nevertheless, the challenges associated with the use of observational data can undermine the results of the studies. Objective To assess the feasibility of using observational data for vaccine effectiveness studies by examining granular weekly effectiveness. Design, Settings and Participants In this retrospective cohort study, we used Columbia University Medical Center data linked to State and City Immunization Registries to assess the weekly effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. We conducted manual chart review of cases in week one in both groups along with a set of sensitivity analyses for Pfizer- BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen vaccines. Main Outcomes and Measures We used propensity score matching with up to 54,987 covariates and fitted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios and constructed Kaplan-Meier plots for two main outcomes (COVID-19 infection and COVID-19-associated hospitalization). Results The study included 179,666 patients. We observed increasing effectiveness after the first dose of mRNA vaccines with week 6 effectiveness approximating 84% (95% CI 72-91%) for COVID-19 infection and 86% (95% CI 69-95) for COVID-19-associated hospitalization. When analyzing unexpectedly high effectiveness in week one, chart review revealed that vaccinated patients are less likely to seek care after vaccination and are more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 during the encounters for other conditions. Sensitivity analyses showed potential outcome misclassification for COVID-19 ICD10-CM diagnosis and the influence of excluding patients with prior COVID-19 infection and anchoring in the unexposed group. Overall vaccine effectiveness analysis in fully vaccinated patients matched the results of the randomized trials. Conclusions and Relevance Observational data can be used to ascertain vaccine effectiveness if potential biases are accounted for. The data need to be scrutinized to ensure that compared groups exhibit similar health seeking behavior and are equally likely to be captured in the data. Given the difference in temporal trends of vaccine exposure and baseline characteristics, indirect comparison of vaccines may produce biased results.

N2  - Objectives: COVID-19 breakthrough infection rates for patients who completed the recommended series of vaccinations per manufacturer were investigated using de-identified ambulatory EHR data. Methods: Real-world ambulatory EHR vaccination data across three EHRs were linked using a unified patient key (UPK) and mined for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine type, manufacturer, series, and vaccination date thru October 31, 2021. To ensure vaccination series were consistently measured for a manufacturer, if the EHR data was not populated or if more than one series was captured for a UPK, then the series was calculated using the vaccination data and vaccination timing recommendations. Three vaccines were investigated Janssen (N=126,456), Moderna (N=803,843), and Pfizer (N=877,720) including records with well-defined manufacturers. COVID-19 positive was defined as having a positive diagnosis or positive COVID-19 antigen test result. Only COVID-19 positives that occurred after Vaccination Complete were investigated. Results: All three vaccines have a less than 1.05% breakthrough infection rate (Janssen 1.03%; Moderna 0.46%, and Pfizer 0.58%). The highest breakthrough infection rates are seen between 14 and 180 days. The rates of breakthrough infection are lower in those manufacturer vaccines that required two shots than those that only required one-shot. Conclusions: EHR data is generally comparable to other studies on vaccine breakthrough rates. The vaccines studied appear to be providing immunity from the current variants of COVID-19 at an acceptable rate. The two-vaccine series/mRNA vaccines may offer a higher-level of immunity than one-shot/conventional vaccines. In the fight against COVID-19 there does appear to be a point in which the currently available vaccines are becoming less effective. The breakthrough infection rates for manufacturers drop between 181 to 240 days. The drop is currently unaccounted for but may be due to vaccination boosters or currently not enough data to capture that cohort.

N2  - Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a systemic inflammatory disease and the most common skin disorder among children. It has been found to be associated with several comorbidities. As COVID-19 cases continue to surge worldwide, especially among children, we aim to study the safety profile and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine in AD children, a topic with little data thus far. A retrospective analysis was done using TriNetX, a multicenter database of ∼80 million deidentified records. Children (<18 years) who were vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine up to November 15th, 2021 were identified and split into AD and non-AD cohorts. A 1:1 matched propensity score analysis was conducted, adjusting for comorbidities and demographics, to generate adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% CI for safety and efficacy outcomes respectively. Safety outcomes included 1-day anaphylaxis and 60-day follow-up for all-cause hospitalization, and FDA-defined adverse events of special interest (AESI). Efficacy was measured as 60-day risk of breakthrough infection (BI). From the 73,984 children who received a COVID-19 vaccine, 6% had AD. A matched cohort of 4505 AD children revealed no differences in safety outcomes for 1 day anaphylaxis (aRR[95%CI]=1.03[0.4,2.4]), 60-day hospitalization (1.25[0.6,2.7]) and AESI (1.02[0.3,2.4]) between cohorts. Additionally AD children did not have a higher risk of BI (aHR[95%CI]=1.7[0.8,3.3]) compared to controls. The results show that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective for pediatric AD patients. Further research is warranted to examine if severity of AD could increase risk of adverse events.

N2  - Our investigation aimed to describe the all-cause mortality rates by COVID-19 vaccination groups in Hungary for an epidemic period (1 April 2021–20 June 2021) and a nonepidemic period (21 June 2021–15 August 2021), and to determine the vaccines’ effectiveness in preventing all-cause mortality utilizing nonepidemic effectiveness measures to adjust for the healthy vaccinee effect (HVE). Sociodemographic status, comorbidity, primary care structural characteristics, and HVE-adjusted survival difference between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts in the epidemic period had been computed by Cox regression models, separately for each vaccine (six vaccines were available in Hungary). Hazard ratio (HR) reduction in epidemic period corrected with nonepidemic period’s HR with 95% confidence interval for each vaccine was used to describe the vaccine effectiveness (VE). The whole adult population (N = 6,404,702) of the country was followed in this study (4,026,849 fully vaccinated). Each vaccine could reduce the HVE-corrected all-cause mortality in the epidemic period (VEOxford/AstraZeneca = 0.592 [0.518–0.655], VEJanssen = 0.754 [0.628–0.838], VEModerna = 0.573 [0.526–0.615], VEPfizer-BioNTech = 0.487 [0.461–0.513], VESinopharm = 0.530 [0.496–0.561], and VESputnik V = 0.557 [0.493–0.614]). The HVE-corrected general mortality for COVID-19 vaccine cohorts demonstrated the real-life effectiveness of vaccines applied in Hungary, and the usefulness of this indicator to convince vaccine hesitants.

N2  - Investigating vaccine effectiveness (VE) in real-world conditions is crucial, especially its variation across different settings and populations. We undertook a test-negative control study in Galicia (Northwest Spain) to assess BNT162b2 effectiveness against acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as well as COVID-19 associated hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality. A total of 44,401 positive and 817,025 negative SARS-CoV-2 test results belonging to adults were included. Adjusted odds ratios of vaccination and their 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using multivariate logistic-regression models. BNT162b2 showed high effectiveness in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections in all age categories, reaching maximum VE ≥ 14 days after administering the second dose [18–64 years: VE = 92.9% (95%CI: 90.2– 95.1); 65–79 years: VE = 85.8% (95%CI: 77.3–91.9), and ≥80 years: VE = 91.4% (95%CI: 87.9–94.1)]. BNT162b2 also demonstrated effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 hospitalization for all age categories, with VE more pronounced for those aged ≥80 years [VE = 60.0% (95%CI: 49.4–68.3)]. Moreover, there was a considerable reduction in ICU admission [VE = 88.0% (95%CI: 74.6–95.8)] and mortality [VE = 38.0% (95%CI: 15.9–55.4)] in the overall population. BNT162b2 showed substantial protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 severity. Our findings would prove useful for systematic reviews and meta-analysis on COVID-19 VE.

N2  - Objectives: The introduction of the Novavax vaccine to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine market has the potential to increase vaccine coverage in the United States (US), where coverage has lagged compared with other high-income countries. This modeling study estimated the cost-effectiveness of including the Novavax vaccine as a potential booster vaccine option for previously vaccinated adults in the US. Methods: A Markov model was developed to estimate COVID-19–related cases, hospitalizations, and deaths with and without the Novavax vaccine as a booster vaccine option. The model population included those boosted and those not boosted and was stratified by age, with health states including susceptible, detected infection, long COVID-19, and recovered. The severity of COVID-19 outcomes among detected infections was based on the highest level of care required. Booster vaccine efficacy was assumed to equal primary vaccine efficacy, sourced from published phase 3 clinical trials based primarily on the prototype variant. Efficacy was assumed to wane equally for all vaccines. Costs per dose were assumed to be equal for all booster vaccines. Other model parameters were sourced from published literature. We estimated the cost-effectiveness from a payer perspective (direct medical costs only) over a 1-year time horizon. Scenario analyses were conducted to investigate the impact of age, coverage assumptions, and analysis perspective on model outcomes. Results: A 5% increase in booster vaccine coverage among a cohort of 100,000 adults eligible for booster vaccination, allocated to the Novavax vaccine market share, resulted in 20.00 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained at an incremental cost of $2,082. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of adding the Novavax vaccine as a booster option was $104/QALY gained. Conclusions: Our results suggest that including the Novavax vaccine as a potential COVID-19 booster option for adults in the US has the potential to be cost-effective across a variety of coverage and market share scenarios.

N2  - Background: Kidney disease is a key risk factor for COVID-19-related mortality and suboptimal vaccine response. Optimising vaccination strategies is essential to reduce the disease burden in this vulnerable population. Methods: With the approval of NHS England, we performed a retrospective cohort study to estimate the comparative effectiveness of schedules involving AZD1222 (AZ; ChAdOx1-S) and BNT162b2 (BNT) among people with kidney disease. Using linked primary care and UK Renal Registry records in the OpenSAFELY-TPP platform, we identified adults with stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease, dialysis recipients, and kidney transplant recipients. We used Cox proportional hazards models to compare COVID-19-related outcomes and non-COVID-19 death after two-dose (AZ–AZ vs BNT–BNT) and three-dose (AZ–AZ–BNT vs BNT–BNT–BNT) schedules. Findings: After two doses, incidence during the Delta wave was higher in AZ–AZ (n=257,580) than BNT–BNT recipients (n=169,205; adjusted hazard ratios [95% CIs] 1·43 [1·37–1·50], 1·59 [1·43–1·77], 1·44 [1·12–1·85], and 1·09 [1·02–1·17] for SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation, COVID-19-related death, and non-COVID-19 death, respectively). Findings were consistent across disease subgroups, including dialysis and transplant recipients. After three doses, there was little evidence of differences between AZ–AZ–BNT (n=220,330) and BNT–BNT–BNT recipients (n=157,065) for any outcome during a period of Omicron dominance. Interpretation: Among individuals with moderate-to-severe kidney disease, two doses of BNT conferred stronger protection than AZ against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease. A subsequent BNT dose levelled the playing field, emphasising the value of heterologous RNA doses in vulnerable populations.

N2  - The duration of protection of the third (booster) dose of the BioNTech/Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA Coronavirus Disease 2019 vaccine has yet to be sufficiently researched, while global discussions around the necessity and effectiveness of a fourth dose are already underway. By conducting a retrospective study implementing a test-negative case-control design, analyzing 546,924 PCR tests performed throughout January 2022 by 389,265 persons who received three doses of the vaccine, we found that the effectiveness in each month since vaccination decreased significantly. Compared to those vaccinated early, on August 2021, relative protection against infection waned from 53.4% a month after vaccination to 16.5% three months after vaccination. These results suggest that there is a significant waning of vaccine effectiveness against the Omicron variant of the third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine within a few months after administration and should prompt policy discussion as to additional booster doses and vaccine development.

N2  - Background: Epidemiological studies show that BCG-vaccinated population seems to be more likely protected from COVID-19 infection, but WHO gave a stark warning on use of BCG vaccine without confirmed COVID-19 trials. The aim of the study is to evaluate whether TB vaccination, performed several years earlier, could confer protection against COVID-19. Methods: After the Ethical Committee authorization, professional orders were used to contact physicians with an online survey. Specialty, COVID-19 infection and previous BCG vaccination were recorded. Statistical data analysis was performed. Results: 1906 physicians answered the questionnaire, (M = 1068; F = 838; mean age 50.7 ± 13.3 years; range 24–87), more than half (1062; 55.7%) experienced BCG vaccination. Professional activity was recorded, and only 49 subjects (2.6%) of them were infected by SARS-CoV2. Among the group of infected people, asymptomatic form occurred in 12 subjects (24.5%); a pauci-symptomatic form in 24 subjects (49.0%); and a severe form (pneumonia and/or respiratory distress) in 13 (26.5%). Considering only the clinically relevant form of COVID-19, period prevalence was 2.2% (23/1062) in the vaccinated group and 1.7% (14/844) in the unvaccinated group (OR: 1.31, 95% C.I.: 0.68–2.63, p = 0.427). Conclusion: Our experience does not confirm the possible protective role of BCG vaccination, performed years earlier, against COVID-19. Although recent epidemiological studies point out in BCG-vaccinated population a lower prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infection, in our cohort of physicians no significant difference was found in terms of prevalence of COVID-19 infection. Our data underline the necessity to follow the WHO warning about the indiscriminate use of BCG vaccine, until clear evidence of protection by BCG vaccination against COVID-19 is fully demonstrated.

N2  - Introduction: COVID-19 vaccines significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 (SCoV2)-related hospitalization and mortality in randomized controlled clinical trials, as well as in real-world effectiveness against different circulating SCoV2-lineages. However, some vaccine recipients show breakthrough infection and it remains unknown, which host and viral factors contribute to this risk and how many resulted in severe outcomes. Our aim was to identify demographic and clinical risk factors for SCoV2 breakthrough infections and severe disease in fully vaccinated individuals and to compare patient characteristics in breakthrough infections caused by SCoV2 Alpha or Delta variant. Methods: We conducted an exploratory retrospective case-control study from 28th of December to 25th of October 2021 dominated by the Delta SCoV2 variant. All cases of infection had to be reported by law to the local health authorities. Vaccine recipients' data was anonymously available from the national Vaccination Monitoring Data Lake and the main local vaccine center. We compared anonymized patients' characteristics of breakthrough infection (n=492) to two overlapping control groups including all vaccine recipients from the Canton of Basel-City (group 1 n=126’586 and group 2 n=109’382). We also compared patients with breakthrough infection caused by the Alpha to Delta variant. We used different multivariate generalized linear models (GLM). Results: We found only 492/126’586 (0.39%) vaccine recipients with a breakthrough infection after vaccination during the 10 months observational period. Most cases were asymptomatic or mild (478/492 97.2%) and only very few required hospitalization (14/492, 2.8%). The time to a positive SCoV2 test shows that most breakthrough infections occurred between a few days to about 170 days after full vaccination, with a median of 78 days (interquartile range, IQR 47-124 days). Factors associated with a lower odds for breakthrough infection were: age (OR 0.987, 95%CI 0.983-0.992), previous COVID-19 infection prior to vaccination (OR 0.296, 95%CI 0.117-0.606), and (self-declared) serious side-effects from previous vaccines (OR 0.289, 95%CI 0.033-1.035). Factors associated with a higher odds for breakthrough infection were: vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (OR 1.459, 95%CI 1.238-1.612), chronic disease as vaccine indication (OR 2.109, 95%CI 1.692-2.620), and healthcare workers (OR 1.404, 95%CI 1.042-1.860). We did not observe a significantly increased risk for immunosuppressed patients (OR 1.248, 95% CI 0.806-1.849). Conclusions: Our study shows that breakthrough infections are rare and show mild illness, but that it occurs early after vaccination with more than 50% of cases within 70 to 80 days post-full vaccination. This clearly implies that boost vaccination should be much earlier initiated compared to the currently communicated 180-day threshold. This has important implications especially for risk groups associated with more frequent breakthrough infections such as healthcare workers, and people in high-risk care facilities. Due to changes in the epidemiological dynamic with new variants emerging, continuous monitoring of breakthrough infections is helpful to provide evidence on booster vaccines and patient groups at risk for potential complications.

N2  - Continuous assessment of the effectiveness of approved COVID-19 vaccines is crucial to gain an insight into the longer-term impact on health outcomes, and eventually boosting public confidence. For this reason, we conducted a multicenter, retrospective cohort study using data on infection and vaccination rates among employees of three Prague hospitals in the period between 27 December 2020 and 31 August 2021. The post-vaccination and post-infection protectiveness were assessed in a total of 11,443 hospital workers who were followed up for more than 14 days either after their Comirnaty vaccination or study enrolment, depending on their previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The effectiveness of full vaccination against any SARS-CoV-2 infection achieved 88.3% (83.2–91.8%) over the eight months of follow-up, a figure not much different from the 92.5% (76.5–97.6%) level of protection built by a previous infection. Despite this, the post-vaccination level of protection declined to about 65% between June and August. No case of breakthrough infection was registered among hospital workers having received one or two vaccine doses more than three months after previous infection. The eight-month effectiveness of the Comirnaty vaccine exhibited a declining trend requiring a new booster dose. The need for vaccination in the previously infected employees was not demonstrated conclusively in this study.

N2  - Background The risk of COVID-19 infection is increased in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and immunosuppressive medications including corticosteroids impact the risk. Furthermore, immunosuppressive medications may reduce the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination. Consensus documents have suggested management strategies on handling immunosuppressive medications to increase vaccine efficacy, but the benefit of such strategies has not been proven. Methods We collected information on COVID infection, COVID vaccination history, and COVID antibodies in the Hopkins Lupus Cohort, a longitudinal cohort with structured quarterly visits. A cohort of healthcare workers was used for comparison. SARS-CoV-2 IgG was measured by ELISA (Euroimmun). Outcome measures included: SARS-CoV-2 antibody IgG levels after vaccination over time in both cohorts; and effect of immunosuppressive medications on post-vaccine IgG levels in SLE patients. Results 228 SLE patients received COVID-19 vaccine: 10 had 1 dose of Johnson & Johnson; 94 had 2 doses of Moderna; and 124 had 2 doses of Pfizer. Of these, 98 patients had no history of COVID infection and at least 1 visit within 210 days before the vaccine series and at least one visit after the vaccine series. SLE patients on immunosuppressive medications had lower post-vaccine IgG levels than SLE patients who were not; but both groups had lower levels than healthcare workers (figure 1). Holding mycophenolate for one week after vaccine increased post-vaccine IgG levels significantly. In multiple variable models, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and belimumab all significantly reduced antibody response to vaccination (table 1). Conclusion SLE patients, regardless of background immunosuppressive therapy, had lower vaccine IgG levels than healthcare workers. Belimumab, tacrolimus and mycophenolate use significantly reduced IgG response to vaccine. Holding mycophenolate for one week improved vaccine efficacy, providing clinical benefit on vaccine response, without leading to clinical flares.

N2  - Background: COVID-19 infection in pregnant people has previously been shown to increase the risk for poor maternal-fetal outcomes. Despite this, there has been a lag in COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant people due to concerns over the potential effects of the vaccine on maternal-fetal outcomes. Here we examine the impact of COVID-19 vaccination and booster on maternal COVID-19 breakthrough infections and birth outcomes. Methods: This was a retrospective multicenter cohort study on the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on maternal-fetal outcomes for people that delivered (n=86,833) at Providence St. Joseph Health across Alaska, California, Montana, Oregon, New Mexico, Texas, and Washington from January 26, 2021 through July 11, 2022. Cohorts were defined by vaccination status at time of delivery: unvaccinated (n=48,492), unvaccinated propensity score matched (n=26,790), vaccinated (n=26,792; two doses of mRNA-1273 Moderna or BNT162b2 Pfizer-BioNTech), and/or boosted (n=7,616). The primary outcome was maternal COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 vaccination status at delivery, COVID-19 infection-related health care, preterm birth (PTB), stillbirth, very low birth weight (VLBW), and small for gestational age (SGA) were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Findings: Vaccinated pregnant people were significantly less likely to have a maternal COVID-19 infection than unvaccinated matched (p<0.0001) pregnant people. During a maternal COVID-19 infection, vaccinated pregnant people had similar rates of hospitalization (p=0.23), but lower rates of supplemental oxygen (p<0.05) or vasopressor (p<0.05) use than those in an unvaccinated matched cohort. Compared to an unvaccinated matched cohort, vaccinated people had significantly lower stillbirth rate (p<0.01) as well as no difference in rate of PTB (p=0.35), SGA (p=0.79), or rate of VLBW (>1,500 g; 0.31). Vaccinated people who were boosted had significantly lower rates of maternal COVID-19 infections (p<0.0001), COVID-19 related hospitalization (p<0.05), PTB (p<0.05), stillbirth (p<0.01), SGA (p<0.05), and VLBW (p<0.01), compared to vaccinated people that did not receive a third booster dose five months after completing the initial vaccination series. Interpretation: COVID-19 vaccination protects against adverse maternal-fetal outcomes with booster doses conferring additional protection against COVID-19 infection. It is therefore important for pregnant people to have high priority status for vaccination, and for them to stay current with their COVID-19 vaccination schedule.

N2  - Castleman Disease (CD) represents a group of rare and heterogeneous hematologic disorders that have common lymph node histopathology. Patients with CD are often immunosuppressed as a consequence of immunemodulating therapy or possibly due to an underlying immunologic dysfunction attributable to B-cell dysfunction. The most severe CD cases experience a cytokine storm disorder, a life-threatening exacerbation of circulating cytokines and immune-cell hyperactivation. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 progresses to a severe cytokine storm in the most severe cases of COVID-19. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is central to the pathogenesis of CD, and increased IL-6 often accompanies severe COVID-19 cases; inhibition of IL-6 with monoclonal antibodies has been shown to be effective therapy for both CD and severe COVID-19. We therefore sought to understand the impact of COVID-19 infection on the natural history of CD and also examined the safety and tolerability of COVID-19 vaccines in this vulnerable patient population. Patients enrolled in a longitudinal natural history study of CD (N=298) were invited to participate in a survey designed to characterize their experience with COVID-19 disease and vaccination. Surveys were emailed to all eligible patients, and reminders were sent up to 3 times. All data is self-reported; descriptive analyses are reported herein. Of the 298 patients who received a survey, 101 (33.9%) completed it. Sixty-nine (68%) had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 at least once, and 10 (14.5%) reported testing positive - including 6 UCD, 3 iMCD, and 1 HHV8+ MCD patients. The reported prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the US compares at 10.5%. Two of the 10 patients reported asymptomatic disease (both UCD), 7 reported mild disease (4 UCD, 1 iMCD, 1 HHV8+MCD), and 1 reported moderate disease requiring hospitalization but not a ventilator or intensive care (iMCD). This severity distribution suggests that these potentially immunocompromised patients experience a range of disease severity consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the broader US population. The most commonly-reported symptoms included fevers/chills, headaches, and loss of taste or smell (N=7 each), as well as shortness of breath/difficulty breathing, muscle and body aches, and cough (N=5 each). Rarer symptoms were also noted among the iMCD patients, including discoloration of skin, lips, or nailbeds (N=1) and newfound confusion (N=2). Two of the 10 patients reported stopping siltuximab treatment during their COVID-19 diagnosis; both subsequently resumed treatment. No other treatment changes were reported. Of the 101 respondents, 87 (86%) had received at least 1 vaccine dose. Treatments, such as immunosuppressants and immunomodulators, were paused for 7 of these patients including, during the vaccination period; this was presumably done to increase the likelihood of a robust response to the vaccine. Fifty-one patients (59%) reported side effects to either dose 1 or 2. Side effects were generally mild, and none required hospitalization. Side effects were more commonly reported after dose 2, with the most common being arm pain (N=34), fatigue (N=30), and headache (N=26). Of those who reported not receiving the vaccine, 2 intend to receive it in the future, 5 reported being unsure about receiving it, and 7 do not intend to receive the vaccine. Common concerns include potential interaction with CD (N=9) and limited safety data (N=8). This study represents the first investigation into the experience of CD patients with SARS-CoV-2 testing, diagnosis, and vaccination. We did not observe a markedly increased inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and vaccination was well-tolerated. A limitation is self-selection survey bias; it is possible that those who chose to participate represent those who had a milder reaction in general. However, it is noteworthy that there were no reports of severe disease in this sample. The prevalence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in this cohort (14.5%) is marginally higher than reported in the US population (10.5%) but statistical comparisons were not performed given that this study does not provide a general epidemiological estimate. However, the distribution of symptoms and vaccine adverse effects in this sample were comparable to the general population. Though additional follow-up is planned for the future, these data are an important basis for understanding the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 and CD.

N2  - Castleman Disease (CD) represents a group of rare and heterogeneous hematologic disorders that have common lymph node histopathology. Patients with CD are often immunosuppressed as a consequence of immunemodulating therapy or possibly due to an underlying immunologic dysfunction attributable to B-cell dysfunction. The most severe CD cases experience a cytokine storm disorder, a life-threatening exacerbation of circulating cytokines and immune-cell hyperactivation. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 progresses to a severe cytokine storm in the most severe cases of COVID-19. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is central to the pathogenesis of CD, and increased IL-6 often accompanies severe COVID-19 cases; inhibition of IL-6 with monoclonal antibodies has been shown to be effective therapy for both CD and severe COVID-19.

N2  - Background: The SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign began on 27 December 2020 in Europe, primarily involving health workers. This study aimed to assess the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination effectiveness, as assessed by reductions in incidence, symptom severity, and further infection spreading. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 9811 health workers operating at the Verona University Hospital, Italy, from 27 December 2020 to 3 May 2021. All health workers were offered vaccination with Comirnaty (BNT162b2, BioNTech/Pfizer, Mainz, Germany/New York, United States), and a health surveillance program was implemented with periodical swab testing. Vaccination status and clinical data were collected using an ad hoc semi-structured questionnaire and health surveillance charts. Results: As of 3rd of May, 82.5% of health workers had been vaccinated against SAR-CoV-2, and 177 (1.8%) had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination more than halved the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduced by two-thirds the cumulative incidence of symptomatic subjects. In detail, most unvaccinated HWs were symptomatic; 50% reported fever, 45% reported ageusia/anosmia, and nearly 20% reported dyspnea. These percentages were much lower in HWs who had been vaccinated for at least 14 days (18% for fever and anosmia, 6% for dyspnea and ageusia). Moreover, cases of vaccine breakthrough were sixfold less likely to further spread the infection than unvaccinated HWs. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination reduced the infection frequency among HWs, further spreading of the infection, and the presence, severity, and duration of COVID-19-related symptoms.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a panel of experts in the EU recognize that a key cause of low influenza vaccine effectiveness is egg adaptation, which arises from vaccine strain mutations during the traditional egg-based vaccine manufacturing process. Cell-based manufacturing processes avoid adaptive mutations, potentially increasing vaccine effectiveness by maintaining closer antigenic similarity of vaccine strains to World Health Organization recommended strains. OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to compare the annualized mean all-cause total healthcare costs among subjects vaccinated with cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIVc) and the standard egg-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIVe) in the US during the 2019-20 influenza season. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of subjects 4-64 years old was conducted using administrative claims data in the US (IQVIA PharMetrics® Plus). Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) was used to adjust for imbalances in measured confounders between groups. Economic outcomes were compared using weighted t-test. Predicted annualized mean all-cause total, pharmacy, and outpatient medical costs were obtained through generalized linear models (GLMs) with binomial distribution/log link. Predicted annualized mean all-cause inpatient and emergency room visit costs were obtained through two-part GLMs, with binomial/ logit model followed by Gamma/log model. The GLMs included adjustment for outliers (99th percentile). To avoid any influenza outcome misclassification with covid-19 infection, the study period ended in March 7th 2020. RESULTS: During the 2019-20 influenza season, the IPTW sample comprised 1,150,134 recipients of QIVc and 3,924,819 of QIVe. In pair-wise comparisons, QIVc was associated with lower mean annualized all-cause costs (USD) per patient ($8,039 vs $8,581; P < 0.0001) compared to QIVe, primarily driven by lower costs for hospitalizations ($1,297 vs $1,466; P < 0.0001) and outpatient medical services ($4,204 vs $4,526; P < 0.0001). Following GLM adjustment, QIVc was associated with lower predicted mean annualized all-cause costs compared to QIVe (incremental cost difference of $467 per vaccinated subject), again driven by lower costs for outpatient medical services ($282) and hospitalizations ($159), both of which were statistically significant (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: During the 2019-20 influenza season, cellbased quadrivalent influenza vaccines were associated with significant cost-savings compared with standard-dose eggbased influenza vaccines among subjects 4-64 years old.

N2  - Recently, Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness has decreased especially against mild disease due to emergence of the Delta variant and waning protection. In this register-based study among healthcare workers in Finland, the vaccine effectiveness of two-dose mRNA vaccine series against SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased from 82% (95% CI 79-85%) 14-90 days after vaccination to 53% (43-62%) after 6 months. Similar trend was observed for other series. Waning was not observed against Covid-19 hospitalization. These results facilitate decision-making of booster doses for healthcare workers.

N2  - Background Little is known about the protection following prior infection with different SARS-CoV-2 variants, COVID-19 vaccination, and a combination of the two (hybrid immunity) in adolescents. Methods We used national SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-19 mRNA vaccination data in England to estimate protection following previous infection and vaccination against symptomatic PCR-confirmed delta and omicron BA.1/BA.2 variants in 11-17-year-olds using a test-negative case-control design. Findings By 31 March 2022, 63.6% of 16-17-year-olds and 48.2% of 12-15-year-olds had received ≥1 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose. Between 08 August 2021 and 31 March 2022, 1,161,704 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-tests were successfully linked to COVID-19 vaccination status. In unvaccinated adolescents, prior infection with wildtype, alpha or delta provided greater protection against subsequent delta infection than subsequent omicron; prior omicron infection provided had the highest protection against omicron reinfection (59.3%; 95%CI: 46.7-69.0). In infection-naïve adolescents, vaccination provided lower protection against symptomatic omicron infection than delta, peaking at 64.5% (95%CI; 63.6-65.4) 2-14 days after dose two and 62.9% (95%CI; 60.5-65.1) 2-14 weeks after dose three, with rapidly waning protection after each dose. Previously infected and vaccinated adolescents had the highest protection, irrespective of primary infecting SARS-CoV-2 strain. The highest protection against omicron was observed in vaccinated adolescents with prior omicron infection, reaching 96.4% (95%CI, 84.4-99.1) at 15-24 weeks post dose two. Interpretation All variants provide some protection against symptomatic reinfection and vaccination adds to protection. Vaccination provides low-to-moderate protection against symptomatic omicron infection, with waning protection after each dose, while hybrid immunity provides the most robust protection.

N2  - Adolescents in the UK were recommended to have their first dose of mRNA vaccine during a period of high community transmission due to the highly transmissible Delta variant, followed by a second dose at an extended interval of 8-12 weeks. We used national SARS-CoV-2 testing, vaccination and hospitalisation data to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) using a test-negative case-control design, against PCR-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 in England. BNT162b2 vaccination in 12-15-year-olds and 16-17-year-olds was associated with lower VE against symptomatic COVID-19 caused by Omicron compared to Delta. Data shows a rapid increase in VE against symptomatic COVID-19 after the second dose for both Delta and Omicron, although this declines to 23% against Omicron after 70+ days. Very high protection was achieved for Delta against hospitalisation after one dose. Our data highlight the importance of the second vaccine dose for protection against symptomatic COVID-19 and raise important questions about the objectives of an adolescent immunisation programme. If prevention of infection is the primary aim, then regular COVID-19 vaccine boosters will be required.

N2  - Objective: COVID-19 vaccination is now recommended for all pregnant women. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesise evidence on vaccine effectiveness and perinatal outcomes after COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis Methods: The COVID-19 Research, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched in accordance with PRISMA guidelines from 1st December 2020 to 9th January 2022 (CRD42021274016). To identify safety reports and briefings, we performed additional hand searches of preprint servers, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency websites. Studies reporting perinatal outcomes or vaccine effectiveness after COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy were included. Pair-wise meta-analyses were undertaken. Results: There were 23 reports of 117,552 COVID-19 vaccinated women, almost exclusively with mRNA vaccines and all from high-income countries. The effectiveness of mRNA vaccination against RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV- 2 infection 7 days after the second dose was 895% (95% CI 690-96 4%, 3 observational studies, 18,828 vaccinated pregnant women, I2 = 739%). The odds of stillbirth were significantly reduced in the vaccinated cohort by 15% (7studies, pooled OR 085; 95% CI 073-0 99, 66,067 vaccinated vs; 424,624 unvaccinated, p = 0035, I2 = 939%). The cumulative effect shows a non-statistically significant 10% reduction in preterm birth before 37 weeks' gestation following COVID-19 vaccination in studies accounting for time-varying confounding, (2 studies, pooled HR 090; 95% CI 081 -1 00, 10,197 vaccinated vs; 36,414 unvaccinated, I2 = 111%, p = 0051). Using pair-wise meta-analysis of outcomes among vaccinated (vs. unvaccinated) pregnant women, there was no evidence of an increase in the risk of outcomes that could be examined: for the mother, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and preeclampsia specifically, placental abruption, pulmonary embolism, postpartum haemorrhage, intensive care unit admission, and maternal death; and for the neonate, miscarriage, gestational age at birth, birthweight Z-score, or neonatal intensive care unit admission. Conclusion: COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in pregnancy appears to be as effective in preventing proven SARS-CoV- 2 infection in pregnancy, as demonstrated outside pregnancy. Importantly, these mRNA vaccinates are safe in pregnancy and associated with a significant reduction in stillbirth.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the benefits of vaccine mandates and vaccine passports (VMVP) for SARS-CoV-2 by estimating the benefits of vaccination and exclusion of unvaccinated people from different settings. Methods: Quantified the benefits of vaccination using meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and transmission studies to estimate the relative risk reduction (RRR), absolute risk reduction (ARR), and number needed to vaccinate (NNV) for transmission, infection, and severe illness/hospitalization. Estimated the baseline infection risk and the baseline transmission risks for different settings. Quantified the benefits of exclusion using these data to estimate the number of unvaccinated people needed to exclude (NNE) to prevent one transmission in different settings. Modelled how the benefits of vaccination and exclusion change as a function of baseline infection risk. Studies were identified from recent systematic reviews and a search of MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, Embase, Global Health, and Google Scholar. Results: Data on infection and severe illness/hospitalization were obtained from 10 RCTs and 19 cohort studies of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, totalling 5,575,049 vaccinated and 4,341,745 unvaccinated participants. Data from 7 transmission studies were obtained, totalling 557,020 index cases, 49,328 contacts of vaccinated index cases, and 1,294,372 contacts of unvaccinated index cases. The estimated baseline infection risk in the general population is 3.04%. The estimated breakthrough infection risk in the vaccinated population is 0.57%. Vaccines are very effective at reducing the risk of infection (RRR=88%, ARR=2.59%, NNV=39) and severe illness/hospitalization (RRR=89%, ARR=0.15%, NNV=676) in the general population. While the latter effect is small, vaccines nearly eliminate the baseline risk of severe illness/hospitalization (0.16%). Among an infected person’s closest contacts (primarily household members), vaccines reduce transmission risk (RRR=41%, ARR=11.04%, NNV=9). In the general population, the effect of vaccines on transmission risk is likely very small for most settings and baseline infection risks (NNVs ≥ 1,000). Infected vaccinated people have a nontrivial transmission risk for their closest contacts (14.35%), but it is less than unvaccinated people (23.91%). The transmission risk reduction gained by excluding unvaccinated people is very small for most settings: healthcare (NNE=4,699), work/study places (NNE=2,193), meals/gatherings (NNE=531), public places (NNE=1,731), daily conversation (NNE=587), and transportation (NNE=4,699). Exclusion starts showing benefits on transmission risk for some settings when the baseline infection risk is between 10% to 20%. Conclusions: The benefits of VMVP are clear: the coercive element to these policies will likely lead to increased vaccination levels. Our study shows that higher vaccination levels will drive infections lower and almost eliminate severe illness/hospitalization from the general population. This will substantially lower the burden on healthcare systems. The benefits of exclusion are less clear. The NNEs suggest that hundreds, and even thousands, of unvaccinated people may need to be excluded from various settings to prevent one SARS-CoV-2 transmission from unvaccinated people. Therefore, consideration of the costs of exclusion is warranted, including staffing shortages from losing unvaccinated healthcare workers, unemployment/unemployability, financial hardship for unvaccinated people, and the creation of a class of citizens who are not allowed to fully participate in many areas of society.

N2  - Background: The short-term effectiveness of a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine for adolescents has been demonstrated. However, little is known about the long-term effectiveness in this age group. It is known, though, that waning of vaccine-induced immunity against infection in adult populations is evident within a few months. Methods: Leveraging the centralized computerized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), we conducted a matched case-control design for evaluating the association between time since vaccination and the incidence of infections, where two outcomes were evaluated separately: a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection (regardless of symptoms) and a symptomatic infection (COVID-19). Cases were defined as individuals aged 12 to 16 with a positive PCR test occurring between June 15 and December 8, 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant in Israel. Controls were adolescents who had not tested positive previously. Results: We estimated a peak vaccine effectiveness between 2 weeks and 3 months following receipt of the second dose, with 85% and 90% effectiveness against SARSCoV-2 infection and COVID-19, respectively. However, in line with previous findings for adults, waning of vaccine effectiveness was evident in adolescents as well. Long-term protection conferred by the vaccine was reduced to 75-78% against infection and symptomatic infection, respectively, 3 to 5 months after the second dose, and waned to 58% against infection and 65% against COVID-19 after 5 months. Conclusions: Like adults, vaccine-induced protection against both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 wanes with time, starting three months after inoculation and continuing for more than five months.

N2  - The availability of effective vaccines and a high vaccination rate allowed the recent mitigation, or even withdrawal, of many protective measures for containing the SARS CoV-2 pandemic. At the same time, new and highly mutated variants of the virus are found to have significantly higher transmissibility and reduced vaccine efficacy, thus causing high infection rates during the third year of the pandemic. The combination of reduced measures and increased infectivity poses a particular risk for unvaccinated individuals, including animals susceptible to the virus. Among the latter, non-human primates (NHPs) are particularly vulnerable. They serve as important models in various fields of biomedical research and because of their cognitive capabilities, they receive particular attention in animal welfare regulations around the world. Yet, although they played an extraordinarily important role for developing and testing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the protection of captive rhesus monkeys against Covid-19 has rarely been discussed. We here report upon twofold mRNA vaccination of a cohort of 19 rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) against infection by SARS-CoV-2. All animals were closely monitored on possible side effects of vaccination, and were tested for neutralising antibodies against the virus. The data show that vaccination of rhesus monkeys is a safe and reliable measure to protect these animals against SARS-CoV-2.

N2  - SESSION TITLE: Critical Care Management of COVID-19 SESSION TYPE: Original Investigations PRESENTED ON: 10/17/2022 01:30 pm - 02:30 pm PURPOSE: To compare the incidence of hospital acquired infections (HAI) in patients treated with systemic corticosteroids (dexamethasone or equivalent alternative corticosteroid) with high (> 10 mg/day) vs low (6 mg/day) dose for COVID-19 related acute hypoxemic failure METHODS: Observational cohort study of COVID-19 patients from July 25 and Oct 1, 2021 at a tertiary care hospital. 227 hospitalized patients were positive for COVID-19. 168 patients were included in the analysis. Corticosteroid type and dose was analyzed. Comparison of high vs low dose cohorts was done. Primary outcome measure was incidence of HAI in each group. Bloodstream Infections (BSI), Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) and Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) were included. Secondary measures were number of patients requiring intubation, length of ICU stay and inpatient mortality. Descriptive statistics were used to compare variables between cohorts including body mass index (BMI), severity of illness (SOFA and modified SOFA scores) and glucose control RESULTS: Of 168 patients: 68 (40%) received high dose (> 10 mg dexamethasone) & 100 patients (60%) received low dose (6 mg dexamethasone) corticosteroids. High vs Low dose: Demographics: Age (57 vs. 64 years; p 0.21), sex (51% vs. 57% female; p 0.77) & chronic comorbidities including BMI (29.2 vs 33.1; p 0.45). Severity of illness scores at day of corticosteroid use were similar (SOFA 4.7 vs 4.1; p 0.71 & mSOFA 2.6 vs 2.3; p 0.07) despite difference in rates of patients that required intubation (56% vs 18%; p<0.001). 45% of intubated died in high dose compared to 18% in low dose group. Overall mortality was 29.4% vs 11%; p 0.011. Glucose control (insulin > 50 u/day) was worse in high dose group (35% vs 14%; p<0.01). Baricitinib or tocilizumab used in 60% vs 44% of intubated; p0.62). HAI data: BSI- High dose 18/68 (26.5 %) vs low dose group 13/10 (13%); p 0.07. UTI-High dose 4/68 (6%) vs low dose group 5/100 (5%); p 1.00. HAP-High dose 27/68 (39.7%) vs low dose group 11/100 (11%); p <0.001. High dose group HAP > 1 organism: 15/27 (MSSA 44%, Aspergillus 18%, MRSA 18%, Streptococcus 26%, Pseudomonas 18%, rest were Enterobacter, H Influenzae, Acinetobacter, Serratia, E coli, Klebsiella, Providencia and Citrobacter species at 3% each). Low dose group HAP > 1 organism: 2/11 (Streptococcus 36%, MSSA 27%, H Influenzae 18%, rest were pseudomonas, E coli, stenotrophomonas and acinetobacter species) CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure, high dose dexamethasone use was associated with significantly higher HAP rates compared to low dose dexamethasone. Moreover the high dose group had higher BSI, worse glucose control, higher intubations and deaths in the intubated cohort despite similar severity of illness in either group CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: High dose dexamethasone may increase susceptibility to HAIs and negatively impact outcomes in COVID-19 associated hypoxemic failure DISCLOSURES: No relevant relationships by Beenish Bhutta No relevant relationships by Rosalyn Chi No relevant relationships by Jason Graf No relevant relationships by mohsin iqbal No relevant relationships by Rajat Kapoor No relevant relationships by Rachel Kruer No relevant relationships by Connor Parker No relevant relationships by Omar Rahman No relevant relationships by James Skinner

N2  - As new COVID-19 variants emerge, it’s vital to understand how certain populations are affected. Sparse data exists on whether vaccinated patients with prior cutaneous malignancies are at higher risk for adverse events or breakthrough infections (BI) compared to the general population. Therefore, we examined the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine in skin cancer patients. A retrospective study using TriNetX, a multicenter database of ∼80 million records, was completed. Patients who completed a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine sequence or received an additional booster were identified up to November 15th 2021 and divided into two cohorts based on history of skin cancer. 1:1 propensity score matching was done, adjusting for comorbidities and demographics, to find adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% CI for safety and efficacy outcomes respectively. Safety outcomes included 1-day anaphylaxis, 60-day follow-up for hospitalization, and FDA-defined adverse events of special interest (AESI). Efficacy included 60-day risk of BI. Subgroup analysis was conducted for basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma patients. A matched cohort of 17,384 fully vaccinated skin cancer patients revealed no higher risk in 1-day anaphylaxis (aRR[95%CI]=1.01[0.4,2.6]) or 60 day hospitalization (0.98[0.7,1.3]) and AESI (1.2[0.9,1.8]). Skin cancer patients also were not at higher BI risk (1.61[0.9,2.8]). No differences were seen among subgroups compared to controls. In a matched cohort of 6,382 boosted skin cancer patients, similar findings were seen in overall skin cancer patients and subgroups with no higher risk in any assessed adverse events compared to controls. Overall, the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective for patients with a history of skin cancer, but further research is needed.

N2  - The effectiveness of inactivated vaccines (VE) against symptomatic and severe COVID-19 caused by omicron is unknown. We conducted a nationwide, test-negative, case-control study to estimate VE for homologous and heterologous (BNT162b2) booster doses in adults who received two doses of CoronaVac in Brazil in the Omicron context. Analyzing 1,386,544 matched-pairs, VE against symptomatic disease was 8.6% (95% CI, 5.6-11.5) and 56.8% (95% CI, 56.3-57.3) in the period 8-59 days after receiving a homologous and heterologous booster, respectively. During the same interval, VE against severe Covid-19 was 73.6% (95% CI, 63.9-80.7) and 86.0% (95% CI, 84.5-87.4) after receiving a homologous and heterologous booster, respectively. Waning against severe Covid-19 after 120 days was only observed after a homologous booster. Heterologous booster might be preferable to individuals with completed primary series inactivated vaccine.

N2  - Introduction: Widespread administration of COVID-19 vaccination can potentially limit the spread and devastation of infection in the United States. Despite the availability of safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19, there continues to be multifaceted hesitancy towards it. In this present study, we evaluated our inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patient cohort's acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine at an urban university medical center. Methods: A retrospective chart review using an electronic medical record was conducted of all IBD patients seen from 1/1/2016 to 1/31/2021 by gastroenterologists at an urban, tertiary care, university medical center. Patient gender, age, race, IBD subtype, and medication regimen were obtained. Phone-based surveys were conducted to determine patients' acceptance of COVID vaccine. Patients were excluded if they were unable to be contacted or there was missing demographic data. A confidential database was created using Microsoft Excel. Fischer exact tests were used with statistical significance set at p<0.05. This study was approved by the university IRB. Results: 218 of 458 (47.6%) medical records were reviewed. There were 127 (58.3%) women, 91 (41.7%) men, with mean age of 44.4 years. 123 (56.4%) had ulcerative colitis, 93 (42.7%) Crohn's disease, 2 (0.9%) with indeterminate colitis. 91 (41.7%) were on biologic therapy. 195 (89.4%) of our IBD patient cohort received or intended to receive the COVID vaccine. There was no significant difference in the rate of vaccine acceptance based upon age (p=0.212), gender (p=1.000), IBD type (p=0.150) or medication regimen (p=0.623). Conclusion: The findings of this study are reassuring in demonstrating similar intention of vaccine receipt across age, gender, disease subtype, and treatment regimen in IBD patients. It is also important to highlight that vaccination intent is significantly higher among IBD patient cohort than the general US population (defined as roughly 50% in December 2020). While this study is limited due to size, the rate of patient vaccine acceptance is encouraging since guidelines strongly support vaccination of IBD patients regardless of medication regimen. Further research is warranted to determine whether significant correlations exist between demographic groups and vaccine concerns.

N2  - Objective: To estimate the effectiveness of 2-dose and 3-dose mRNA vaccination (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273) against general SARS-CoV-2 infection (asymptomatic or symptomatic) caused by the omicron variant. Design: Propensity-score matched retrospective Cohort Study. Setting: Large public university undergoing weekly Covid-19 testing in South Carolina, USA. Participants: Population consists of 24,145 university students and employees undergoing weekly Covid-19 testing between January 3rd and January 31st, 2022. The analytic sample was constructed via propensity score matching on vaccination status: Unvaccinated, completion of 2-dose mRNA series within previous 5 months, and receipt of mRNA booster dose within previous 5 months. The resulting analytic sample consists of 1,944 university students and 658 university employees. Intervention: Vaccination with a two dose or 3 dose regimen of the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine. Results: Booster protection against any SARS-CoV-2 infection was 66.4% among employees (95% CI: 46.1-79.0%; P<.001) and 45.4% among students (95% CI: 30.0-57.4%; P<.001). Compared to the 2-dose mRNA series, estimated increase in protection from the booster dose was 40.8% among employees (P=.024) and 37.7% among students (P=.001). We did not have enough evidence to conclude a statistically significant protective effect of the 2-dose mRNA vaccination series, nor did we have enough evidence to conclude that protection waned in the 5-month period after receipt of the 2nd or 3rd mRNA dose. Furthermore, we did not find evidence that protection varied by manufacturer. Conclusions: Covid-19 mRNA booster doses offer moderate protection against any SARS-CoV-2 infection caused by the omicron variant and provide a substantial increase in protection relative to the 2-dose mRNA vaccination series.

N2  - It is important to assess the extent to which the real-world effectiveness of marketed vaccines is consistent with that observed in the clinical trials, and to characterize how well vaccines prevent COVID-19 symptoms. We conducted a modified test-negative design (TND) to evaluate the RW effectiveness of three COVID-19 vaccines by leveraging data from an on-going, US community-based registry. Vaccine effectiveness was examined in two ways: considering cases who (1) tested positive for COVID-19 (695 cases, 1,786 controls) and who (2) tested positive with at least one moderate/severe COVID-19 symptom (165 cases, 2,316 controls). Any vaccination (full or partial) was associated with a 95% reduction in the odds of having a positive COVID-19 test [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.04, 0.06)]. Full vaccination was associated with an aOR of 0.03 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.05) while partial vaccination had an aOR of 0.08 (95% CI: 0.06, 0.12). Any vaccination was associated with a 71% reduction in the odds of testing positive and having at least one moderate/severe symptom (aOR=0.29 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.40)). High effectiveness was observed across all three vaccine manufacturers both for prevention of positive COVID-19 test results and prevention of moderate/severe COVID-19 symptoms.

N2  - Background. Novel SARS-CoV-2 (SCV2) variants may differ in epidemiology and clinical impact. PAIVED, a randomized trial comparing the efficacy of 3 different platforms of inactivated influenza vaccines in adult military health system beneficiaries, actively surveils participants for influenza-like illness (ILI), including COVID-19, and conducts targeted investigations among those who develop ILI. The current season (2021/22) offered an opportunity to assess symptomatology associated with emerging SCV2 variants in this prospective cohort. Methods. Following receipt of influenza vaccine, PAIVED participants receive a weekly email or text message querying for ILI symptoms. Those who reported ILI completed a validated symptom diary (FLU-PRO Plus) daily for 7 days and collected a nasal swab. Nasal specimens underwent multiplex PCR testing, followed by SCV2 genome sequencing as applicable. PAIVED study participants from the 2021-22 influenza season who reported an ILI, had confirmed infection with SCV2 for which sequence data is available, and completed at least one FLU-PRO Plus survey were included in this analysis. Results. To date, 293 participants (7% of active cohort; 22.5% reporting ILI) tested positive for SCV2; sequencing has identified 23 Delta and 200 Omicron variants (199 BA.1, 1 BA.2). Among the 212 participants with sequenced SCV2 and symptom data, 55% were male, 57% were white, and 85% were active-duty military (Table 1). Overall, peak symptom severity was classified as mild to moderate in 79.3% of cases, fever duration averaged 2.5±2.2 days, and there were activity limitations for a mean of 5.2±3.8 days. No differences in maximum symptom scores (total or by domain) were detected for participants infected with Omicron compared to Delta. Figure 1 depicts variation in mean symptom scores by day of ILI, grouped by variant Conclusion. Omicron emerged as the predominant SCV2 variant causing ILI in our cohort this season, typically manifesting with mild symptoms. Further exploration of potential differences in ILI experience between SCV2 variants and other ILI causes, plus the impact and timing of vaccination, will add insight into the relative contribution of such factors on symptomatology.

N2  - Background: Beginning in March 2021, Mexico vaccinated childcare workers with a single-dose CanSino Biologics (Adv5-nCoV) COVID-19 vaccine. Although CanSino is currently approved for use in 10 Latin American, Asian, and European countries, little information is available about its vaccine effectiveness (VE). Methods: We evaluated CanSino VE within a childcare worker cohort that included 1,408 childcare facilities. Participants were followed during March–December 2021 and tested through SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR or rapid antigen test if they developed any symptom compatible with COVID-19. Vaccination status was obtained through worker registries. VE was calculated as 100% × (1−hazard ratio for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated vs. unvaccinated participants), using an Andersen-Gill model adjusted for age, sex, state, and local viral circulation. Results: The cohort included 43,925 persons who were mostly (96%) female with a median age of 32 years; 37,646 (86%) were vaccinated with CanSino. During March–December 2021, 2,250 (5%) participants had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, of whom 25 were hospitalized and 6 died. Adjusted VE was 20% (95% CI = 10–29%) against illness, 76% (42–90%) against hospitalization, and 94% (66–99%) against death. VE against illness declined from 48% (95% CI = 33–61) after 14–60 days following full vaccination to 20% (95% CI = 9–31) after 61–120 days. Conclusions: CanSino vaccine was effective at preventing COVID-19 illness and highly effective at preventing hospitalization and death. It will be useful to further evaluate duration of protection and assess the value of booster doses to prevent COVID-19 and severe outcomes.

N2  - Background: There is a scarcity of research regarding the effectiveness of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccines in patients taking immunosuppressant medications, and no data are published to date pertaining to their effectiveness against omicron (B.1.1.529) variant SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalisation. We aimed to assess the relationship between immunosuppressive medications, mRNA vaccination, omicron infection, and severe COVID-19 outcomes (ie, hospitalisation, ICU admission, death). Methods: We did a retrospective cohort study and included vaccinated and unvaccinated people aged 18 years or older in the Michigan Medicine health-care system, USA, during the omicron-dominant period of the pandemic (Dec 16, 2021–March 4, 2022). We collected data from electronic health records (demographics, diagnoses, medications) combined with immunisation data from the Michigan State Registry to determine vaccination status, and we collected COVID-19-related hospitalisation data by chart review. We used a Cox proportional hazards model based on calendar time to assess the effectiveness of the mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccines in people taking immunosuppressive medications (conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs [DMARDs], biologic DMARDs, or glucocorticoids within the past 3 months), while controlling for participant characteristics. Using the same model, we assessed the effect of different classes of medication such as immunosuppressive DMARDs, immunomodulatory DMARDs, and glucocorticoids on SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalisation due to COVID-19. All analyses were done using complete cases after removing participants with missing covariates. Findings: 209 492 people were identified in Michigan Medicine, including 165 913 who were vaccinated and 43 579 who were unvaccinated. 41 078 people were excluded because they were younger than 18 years, partially vaccinated, had received a vaccine other than the two vaccines studied, or had incomplete covariate data. 168 414 people were included in the analysis; 97 935 (58%) were women, 70 479 (42%) were men, and 129 816 (77%) were White. 5609 (3%) people were taking immunosuppressive medications. In patients receiving immunosuppressants, three doses of BNT162b2 had a vaccine effectiveness of 50% (95% CI 31–64; p<0·0001) and three doses of mRNA-1273 had a vaccine effectiveness of 60% (42–73; p<0·0001) against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Three doses of either vaccine had an effectiveness of 87% (95% CI 73–93; p<0·0001) against hospitalisation due to COVID-19. Receipt of immunosuppressive DMARDs (hazard ratio 2·32, 95% CI 1·23–4·38; p=0·0097) or glucocorticoids (2·93, 1·77–4·86; p<0·0001) and a history of organ or bone marrow transplantation (3·52, 2·01–6·16; p<0·0001) were associated with increased risk of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 compared with those who had not received immunosuppressive medications or transplant. Interpretation: People taking immunosuppressive DMARDs or glucocorticoids are at substantially higher risk of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 than the general population. However, the mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccines remain effective within this group, and it is important that patients taking these medications remain up to date with vaccinations to mitigate their risk.

N2  - Importance: Systematic characterization of the protective effect of vaccinations across time and at-risk populations is needed to inform public health guidelines and personalized interventions. Objective: To evaluate the vaccine effectiveness (VE) over time and determine differences across demographic and clinical risk factors of COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This test negative design consisted of adult patients who were tested or diagnosed for COVID-19 at Michigan Medicine in 2021. Variables extracted from Electronic Health Records included vaccination status, age, gender, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, body mass index, residential-level socioeconomic characteristics, past COVID-19 infection, being immunosuppressed, and health care worker status. Exposure: The primary exposure was vaccination status and was categorized into fully vaccinated with and without booster, partially vaccinated, or unvaccinated. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were infection with COVID-19 (positive test or diagnosis) and having severe COVID-19, i.e., either being hospitalized or deceased. Based on these, VE was calculated by quarter, vaccine, and patient characteristics. Results: Of 170,487 COVID-19 positive adult patients, 78,002 (45.8%) were unvaccinated, and 92,485 (54.2%) were vaccinated, among which 74,060 (80.1%) were fully vaccinated. COVID-19 positivity and severity rates were substantially higher among unvaccinated (12.1% and 1.4%, respectively) compared to fully vaccinated individuals (4.7% and 0.4%, respectively). Among 7,187 individuals with a booster, only 18 (0.3%) had a severe outcome. The covariate-adjusted VE against an infection was 62.1% (95%CI 60.3-63.8%), being highest in the Q2 of 2021 (90.9% [89.5-92.1%]), lowest in Q3 (60.1% [55.9-64.0%]), and rebounding in Q4 to 68.8% [66.3-71.1%]). Similarly, VE against severe COVID-19 overall was 73.7% (69.6-77.3%) and remained high throughout 2021: 87.4% (58.1-96.3%), 92.2% (88.3-94.8%), 74.4% (64.8-81.5%) and 83.0% (78.8-86.4%), respectively. Data on fully vaccinated individuals from Q4 indicated additional protection against infection with an additional booster dose (VE-Susceptibility: 64.0% [61.1-66.7%] vs. 87.3% [85.0-89.2%]) and severe outcomes (VE-Severity: 78.8% [73.5-83.0%] vs. 94.0% [89.5-96.6%]). Comparisons between Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines indicated similar protection against susceptibility (82.9% [80.7-84.9%] versus 88.1% [85.5-90.2%]) and severity (87.1% [80.3-91.6%]) vs. (84.9% [76.2-90.5%]) after controlling for vaccination timing and other factors. There was no significant effect modification by all the factors we examined. Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccines offered high protection against infection and severe COVID-19, and showed decreasing effectiveness over time and improved protection with a booster.

N2  - Introduction: To obtain control of the COVID-19 epidemic in Cuba, the decision was made by the highest management of the government and the Ministry of Public Health to carry out a health intervention with Abdala vaccine in Matanzas province, due to its high incidence and mortality. Objective: To estimate the impact and effectiveness of Abdala vaccine in the face of symptomatic disease of reported cases and death in hospitals in Matanzas province. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, with a cohort of vaccinated people consisting of 252,557 people who met the three-dose schedule, and another of unvaccinated or who had not complied with the complete vaccination schedule of 325,462 people. Age and personal pathological history were explored. As a source of information, the registry of confirmed cases and deaths issued by the Ministry of Public Health and the automated vaccination base Andariego Higia were used. It was calculated the effectiveness (VE=1-RR) and by confidence intervals and analyzed epidemiological indicators with the Bayesian structural time series method. Results: The effectiveness against symptomatic disease and death was 75.5 % and 95.7 %, respectively. In the analysis of the causal impact, values of reduction of 90.0% of the reported incidence and 86.0% of mortality were evidenced with respect to the expected figures. Conclusions: Abdala vaccine showed high effectiveness and impact in the prevention of symptomatic disease and death in real-world conditions.

N2  - BACKGROUND: the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after the second vaccine dose decline in the following months; an additional vaccine dose (booster) is able to swiftly restore the immune system, significantly reducing the risk of severe disease. In the winter of 2021, a new, particularly infectious variant made the need to increase booster coverage in the population even more urgent. OBJECTIVES: to present, using real data, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the booster dose in reducing severe disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in terms of COVID-19 hospitalization and intensive care admission, and all-cause mortality. DESIGN: descriptive study of vaccination uptake; associative study of the factors linked with uptake of vaccination and COVID-19 symptoms; associative study of vaccine effectiveness against hospital admission and mortality. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: population residing in the Milan and Lodi provinces (Lombardy Region, Northern Italy), eligible for anti-SARS-COV-2 vaccination, with subjects aged ≥19 years alive as at 01.10.2021, not residing in nursing homes, followed-up until 31.12.2021. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: COVID-19 symptoms, hospitalization, intensive care hospitalization, and all-cause mortality in the period 01.10.2021-31.12.2021. RESULTS: the cohort included 2,936,193 patients as of 01.10.2021; at the end of the observation period (31.12.2021), 378,616 (12.9%) were unvaccinated, 60,102 (2.0%) had received only 1 dose and had not had the disease, 68,777 (2.3%) had received only 1 dose and had had the disease, 412,227 (14.0%) were fully vaccinated with 2 doses less than 4 months earlier, 198,459 (6.8%) had received 2 doses [4,5) months earlier, 439,363 (15.0%) had received 2 doses [5,6) months earlier, 87,984 (3.0%) had received 2 doses [6,7) months earlier, 74,152 (2.5%) had received 2 doses more than 7 months earlier, 62,614 (2.1%) had received 2 doses and had had the disease, and, finally, 1,153,899 (39.3%) had received a booster shot. In the study period (01.10.2021-31.12.2021), characterized by a very high prevalence of the omicron variant, 121,620 cases (positive antigen/molecular test), 3,661 hospitalizations for COVID-19, 162 intensive care admissions for COVID-19, and 7,508 deaths from all causes were identified. Compared to unvaccinated subjects, subjects who received a booster had half the risk of being symptomatic, and had half the risk of experiencing fatigue, muscle aches, and dyspnoea. In comparison with boosted subjects, unvaccinated subjects had a 10-fold risk of hospitalization, a 9-fold risk of intensive care, and a 3-fold risk of dying. CONCLUSIONS: this work highlights the effectiveness of vaccination in reducing serious adverse events in boosted subjects and the need to implement specific policies of engagement to bring subjects who received their second dose earliest to get a booster.

N2  - Background. Clinical trial demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have the ability of reduce mortality and morbidity due to COVID-19. The aim of this study is to describe the effect of vaccination in term of mortality, type of ventilation and ICU admission among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from May to December 2021 in a Ligurian Hospital. Methods. This is a retrospective, single-center study conducted in San Martino Hospital (Genoa, Italy), including patients ≥ 18 years hospitalized for COVID-19 in Infectious Disease and Emergency Units from 1st May to 31st December 2021. We collected demographical data, multimorbidity and disability score, vaccination time (“vaccinated” all patients hospitalized ≥ 14 days after first dose or ≥ 7 days after second/ third dose), therapy for COVID-19, mortality at 7 and 30 days, ICU admission, ventilation type. Characteristics of vaccinated (group A) versus non vaccinated (group B) patients were compared using Chi-squared/Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and t-test /Kruskal-Wallis test for the continuous ones. Cox proportional hazards models for death at 30 days were performed as univariate analysis as well as adjusting for age, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale [CIRS], gender, Remdesivir, Monoclonal antibodies, Tocilizumab use. Results. Overall, 405 patients SARS-CoV-2 infected were enrolled. Data about timing of vaccination were available for 360 patients (89%). We compared clinical characteristics and outcomes of group A (32%) versus group B (68%). In group A patients were older (p< 0.001) and frailer (higher CIRS score and lower Barthel index, p< 0.001) than in group B. Among patients requiring oxygen, 76 (31.5%) in group B vs 26 (22.41%) in group A needed high flow ventilation (p=0.036); 33 (13.52%) vs 3 (2.59%) respectively were admitted to ICU (Figure 1). Mortality at 30 days after hospitalization was higher in group A at univariate analysis [HR(95%CI) 1.44(0.82; 2.53), p=0.208], lower at multivariate analysis [0.57(0.31; 1.02), p=0.059]. Conclusion. The results of this study confirm that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination reduces rate of admission to ICU and 30 days mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19. In our cohort mortality among vaccinated patients remains high and we hypothesized this is due to high frailty of evaluated population.

N2  - Background and Objectives: By the end of 2020, COVID-19 caused about 350000 death in the US. FDA authorized emergency use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 12/11/2020 and Moderna vaccine on 12/18/2020. University of California Irvine medical center (UCI-Health) administered the first dose of vaccine to the frontline healthcare workers five days after the authorization. We studied the self-reported side effects of the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccines among the UCI-Health Emergency Medicine Department (EMD) personnel who were among the first cohort of people vaccinated in the world. Methods: EMD personnel who received Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in the UCI-Health were invited to report any side effect they experienced within ten days after the first dose of vaccination. Severity of side effect was self-reported on a scale of 1 to 5. Results: Eight (66.7%) male and four (33.3%) female answered the survey questions. Two (16.7%, 2.1%-48.4%) participants reported no side effect and they were both female. The most common side effect was injection site pain (N = 8, 66.7%), followed by fatigue and muscle ache (N = 3, %25.0). Headache, feeling unwell, and fever (N = 2, 16.7%) was the third most common reported side effect. Among those who had reported a symptom, joint pain, tiredness and chills with an average severity of 4 were the most sever; followed by muscle ache (3.5), fatigue (3), and headache (2.5). The average severity of injection site pain was 1.6. Majority of symptoms were resolved by the third day after vaccination. Conclusion: This is among the first reports of COVID-19 vaccine side effects in people vaccinated very first in the world. More longitudinal studies with larger sample size are required for understanding vaccine safety.

N2  - Background: Test-negative designs (TND) are derived from casecontrol designs where cases are patients with a positive test for a specific disease at a healthcare facility and controls are patients with a negative test at the same facility for the same symptoms. TND has been used to assess influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) and is now considered for COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (CVE) assessment. Objectives: To evaluate the applicability and challenges of the TND to assess CVE with respect to internal validity, external validity and efficiency. Methods: A targeted literature review of TND methods applied to IVE was performed and a summary of the strengths and limitations for CVE considering current knowledge about COVID-19 disease and vaccination was prepared. Results: COVID-19 symptomatology is heterogeneous, raising the question of the target population for case assessment. Targeting hospitalized patients would allow the assessment of CVE on prevention of severe illness but a TND in the community setting would evaluate prevention of milder illness. The CVE objective will vary according to each vaccine's target population. Laboratory tests to confirm COVID-19 are numerous with variable performance. In the absence of a gold standard, misclassification of cases and controls is possible, warranting a consistent and reliable diagnostic approach to limit classification bias. In addition, finding more cases than controls (which would limit statistical power) may become a risk if the frequency of non-COVID respiratory infection (e.g. influenza) is lower than expected due to widespread protective measures. Exposure depends on evolving local public health decisions (e.g., priority access, product availability, vaccination organization and schedule). Tracking these policies is key for the design and results interpretation, e.g. imbalance between exposed and unexposed groups could stem from massive vaccination in priority populations and could affect the sample size and CVE precision estimate. Exposure category definition will need to account for alternative vaccination schedules (e.g. lag between doses, no booster). Collecting vaccination data (brand, dates of 1st and 2nd injection) should be done with extra scrutiny to avoid exposure misclassification. Emergency mass vaccination might complicate data collection from medical sources, e.g. vaccination centers with no access to medical records. Conclusions: TND is a valuable approach given the massive testing applied worldwide but results need to be interpreted with caution due to challenges specific to COVID-19.

N2  - Background: Inflammatory Bowel Disease(IBD) and Irritable Bowel Syndrome(IBS) are gastrointestinal disorders which differ in pathophysiology and management. The use of immunomodulatory drugs brings concerns which increased during the pandemic. Similarly, patients with IBS may have concerns about the effect of infection and vaccine on their wellbeing. The aim of this study was to assess for any differences in swabbing, vaccine uptake, COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation rates and outcomes in patients with IBD on immunomodulatory treatment and patients with IBS. Methods: Patients were recruited through the local database (March, 2020 - August, 2021). All IBD patients had a histological diagnosis while IBS patients were diagnosed according to ROME IV criteria. All patients were offered vaccination. Apart from demographic data the following was collected: number of COVID-19 swabs taken, vaccination rates, type of vaccine administered, infection secondary to COVID-19, hospitalization and outcomes. Results: Overall, 250 IBD patients (43.6% female) and, 250 patients with IBS (78.4% female) were recruited. The mean patient age in the IBS cohort was, 40.6 years (SD ±, 11.99) whilst the mean patient age in the IBD cohort was, 40.7 years (SD±15.7). Patients with IBD underwent significantly more COVID-19 swab tests (n=759) than patients with IBS (n=615) (p =0.02). Patients with IBD were having the following biological therapy:, 62.8% Infliximab, 24.8% Adalimumab, 10% Vedolizumab and, 2.4% Ustekinumab. There was no significant difference in COVID-19 infection rate between the IBS cohort (8.8%; n=22 patients;, 2 patients not vaccinated) and the IBD cohort (6.4%; n=16 patients;, 3 patients not vaccinated) (p=0.3). The vaccine uptake rate was similar (IBD:, 91.2%, IBS: 90%). Table, 1 demonstrates the type of vaccine administered to both cohorts. In the IBS cohort, 1 patient was admitted to hospital in view of symptomatic hypoxaemia. The patient was treated with oxygen and dexamethasone, but did not require ventilatory support. Within the IBD cohort, 3 patients requiring admission for IBD related treatment, tested positive asymptomatically on pre-admission COVID-19 screening. All had an uneventful outcome. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that vaccine uptake, Covid-19 infection rates and outcomes were similar in patients with IBS and IBD patients on immunosuppressive therapy. However, IBD patients underwent significantly more swabbing than patients with IBS and this was generally due to patient concern of acquiring Covid-19 while being on immunosuppresive medications. This added psychological burden may further impact patients' psychological state and thus their quality of life. (Table Presented).

N2  - Objective. To determine the effectiveness of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in preventing illness and death from COVID-19 in Córdoba, Argentina, during the period from January through June 2021. Methods. A retrospective cohort study was conducted among 1,139,458 residents of the province of Córdoba. Multiple logistic regression models were developed to describe the relationship between vaccination and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 or death from COVID-19, while taking account of comorbidities and chronic disease risk factors and adjusting for sex and age. Results. Among the general population, having received one or two doses of vaccine reduced the risk of illness by 98.8% and 99.3%, respectively, and the risk of dying by 83% and 96.5%, respectively. Among those who developed COVID-19, the probability of dying was reduced by 57% and 80%, respectively. Regarding probability of death, risk increased with age, with being male, and with obesity, arterial hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Conclusion. Vaccination is effective and protects against the risk of getting COVID-19, developing severe disease, or dying. Having obesity, arterial hypertension, or diabetes mellitus, in descending order, increases the risk of death.

N2  - Background/Purpose: In patients treated with biologics, vaccination against influenza is recommended. However, vaccination coverage remains very low. The use of automatic digital reminders is an attractive option for increasing vaccination coverage without using medical/paramedical time. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of SMS and email reminders of seasonal influenza vaccination in RA patients on biologics Methods: Between Sept 2016 and Jan 2022, the multicentric French ART registry (NCT03062865) recruited ∼1500 RA patients initiating an anti-TNF in 59 centers. At inclusion, patients were proposed to participate in an e-cohort to complete monthly online questionnaires. We designed a nested randomized controlled trial (RCT) within ART's e-cohort (NCT05220423). In October 2021 (start of influenza vaccination campaign), patients who actively participated to the e-cohort (n=446) were randomized to receive (n=224) or not (n=222) email and SMS reminders on the importance of influenza vaccination. In March 2022, they received a questionnaire (and, in case of non-response, sms) about their influenza vaccination during the 2021-2022 campaign. Primary endpoint was the vaccination rate. Missing data were handled by multiple imputation. Results: Among the 446 randomized patients, 233 completed the full influenza questionnaire and 92 patients only reported their 2021-2022 influenza vaccinal status. Non-responders (n=121) were younger, more likely to be non-worker or student, and less likely to have their vaccinal status up to date at the inclusion in the registry. Vaccination rate was 116/158 (73%) in the reminders group and 105/167 (63%) in the no-reminder group. After handling missing data by multiple imputation, the RR of vaccination in the reminders group was 1.07, 95%CI [0.95-1.22] as compared to no-reminders group. Flow chart of the randomized controlled trial In June 2020, 169 patients responded to a questionnaire about their influenza vaccination status during 2019-2020 campaign (before COVID pandemic); 118 (70%) reported having been vaccinated against influenza. Among patients who completed the 2 surveys, the rate of vaccination did not differ between 2020 and 2022 questionnaires (99/137 (72%) vs 99/137 (72%), p=1.00). Characteristics of the 446 RA patients randomized to receive or not reminders on importance of influenza seasonal vaccination in the ART e-cohort Among the 233 patients who fully completed the 2022 questionnaire, 144 (85%) declared that COVID pandemic had not impacted their attitude regarding influenza vaccination. They reported being vaccinated mainly for self-protection (77%) or protection of their relatives (32%). Main reasons of non-vaccination were prioritization of COVID-19 vaccine in 33% or no fear of influenza infection in 25%. Fear of side effects or non-confidence in vaccines were only marginally reported (6 and 8%). Also, 221 (95%) were vaccinated against COVID19. Conclusion: In RA patients treated with biologics and adherent to monthly online questionnaires, SMS/email reminders of importance of influenza vaccination, only modestly, but not significantly, increased vaccination coverage. However, population included in this RCT (reminders or not) had one of the highest reported rates of influenza vaccination. COVID pandemic/vaccinal campaign did not impact RA patient habits regarding influenza vaccination.

N2  - Background: In our experience during the first year of development of ACHOC-C19 study, we observed 26% mortality in patients with cancer and COVID 19 infection. The impact of vaccination was not evaluated prior to the implementation of this strategy worldwide in this kind of population. It was proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of immunization during the second phase of our investigation. Methods: Cohort study derived from the National Registry of Patients with Cancer and COVID-19 (ACHOCC-19). Data were collected from June 2021 since vaccine was available. Patients were: older than 18 years, diagnosed with cancer (solid tumors), treated and/or under follow-up, and with COVID-19 infection. The comparative analysis of the vaccinated and non-vaccinated cohort is presented. Outcomes included: all-cause mortality within 30 days of infection diagnosis, hospitalization, and mechanical ventilation. Effect estimation was performed through relative risk (RR) and multivariate analysis for each event, using generalized linear models of the binomial family. Results: 896 patients were included, 470 were older than 60 years (52.4%) and 59% women (n = 530). 172 patients were recruited in the vaccinated cohort and 724 in the non-vaccinated cohort (ratio: 1 to 4.2). The cumulative incidence of hospitalization among the unvaccinated was 42.4% (n = 307), and among the vaccinated, 29% (n = 50); invasive mechanical ventilation requirement was 8.4% (n = 61) in unvaccinated, and 4.6% (n = 8) in vaccinated. The cumulative incidence of mortality from all causes in the unvaccinated was 17% (n = 123) and in the vaccinated 4.65% (n = 8). Table summarizes the multivariate analysis. The adjusted RR for mortality for the unvaccinated is 3.4 (95% CI: 1.7-6.8), for hospitalization 1.36 (95% CI: 1.08-1.72), and for mechanical ventilation 2.1 (95% CI: 1.02-4.2). Conclusions: The incidence of complications and death in patients with cancer and COVID-19 infection is significantly higher in those who have not received a vaccination schedule compared to those who have been vaccinated. Immunization should be promoted and intensified in this population group.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Up to half of the healthcare economic burden associated with vaccine preventable diseases occur in older adults infected with influenza. Published literature for the 2019-20 influenza season demonstrated similar clinical effectiveness between adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (aTIV) and trivalent high-dose influenza vaccine (TIV-HD). OBJECTIVE: The current research assesses the annualized mean all-cause and influenza-related healthcare costs among subjects 65 + vaccinated with aTIV or TIV-HD during the 2019-20 influenza season. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using professional fee, prescription claims and hospital charge master data in the U.S from IQVIA's New Data Warehouse. Baseline characteristics included age, gender, payer type, geographic region, Charlson Comorbidity Index, comorbidities, indicators of frail health status, and pre-index hospitalization rates. Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) was used to adjust for imbalances in measured confounders between groups. Economic outcomes included annualized mean all-cause and influenza-related costs, which comprised influenza-related hospitalizations, emergency room visits, physician office visits and pharmacy. To avoid any influenza outcome misclassification with covid-19 infection, the study period ended in March 7th 2020. Mean costs were compared using weighted t-test. Predicted annualized mean all-cause healthcare costs were obtained through a generalized linear model (GLM) with binomial distribution/log link, while predicted annualized influenza-related healthcare costs were obtained through 2-part GLM models, with a binomial/logit model followed by Gamma/log model. Adjustment for outliers (99th percentile) was applied in the GLMs. RESULTS: During the 2019-20 influenza season, the IPTW sample comprised 798,987 recipients of aTIV and 1,655,979 recipients of TIV-HD. Following GLM adjustment, predicted mean annualized all-cause and influenza-related costs (USD) per patient were statistically similar between aTIV and TIV-HD ($13,196 vs $13,221; $21.64 vs $21.92, respectively). Both aTIV and TIV-HD were comparable in terms of predicted mean annualized costs for influenza-related hospitalizations ($22.98 vs $22.04) and influenza-related office visits ($2.01 vs $1.92). CONCLUSIONS: Real-world evidence demonstrated that in the 2019-20 influenza season, aTIV and TIV-HD were associated with similar all-cause and influenza-related total healthcare costs.

N2  - It is well established that COVID-19 carries a higher risk of morbidity and mortality in patients (pts) with hematologic malignancies. Emerging data suggests that despite the 3 COVID-19 vaccines with emergency use authorization (EUA) by the FDA inducing high levels of immunity in the general population, pts with hematologic malignancies have lower rates of seroconversion for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibody (Spike IgG) and thus possibly lower protection against severe COVID-19. We established a program of rapid vaccination and evaluation of response in an inner city minority population to help determine the factors that contribute to the poor seroconversion to COVID-19 vaccination in pts with hematologic malignancies. We conducted a cross-sectional cohort study of pts with hematologic malignancies seen at Montefiore Medical Center between March 29, 2021 and July 8, 2021 who completed their vaccination series with 1 of the 3 FDA EUA COVID-19 vaccines, Moderna, Pfizer, or Johnson & Johnson (J&J). We qualitatively measured Spike IgG production in all pts using the AdviseDx Spike IgG assay and performed quantitative analysis on pts who completed their vaccination series with at least 14 days (d) after the 2nd dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines or 28d after the single J&J vaccine. Safety data was collected via questionnaires or as part of the electronic medical record. We analyzed the characteristics of these pts using standard descriptive statistics and associations between pts characteristics, cancer subtypes, treatments, and vaccine response using a Fisher Exact test, Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum test, or Kendall Tau-b test. A total of 121 pts with hematologic malignancies were enrolled and another 10 pts were included by retrospective chart review. Five pts did not have a Spike IgG performed after consent and excluded. Ten patients had Spike IgG testing before completion of their vaccination series and excluded from quantitative analyses. A total of 116 pts were included in immunogenicity analysis and 106 pts in quantitative analysis. Baseline characteristics and representative malignancies are listed in Table 1. Seventy pts (60%) received Pfizer, 36 pts (31%) Moderna, and 10 pts (9%) J&J. Median time from vaccination completion to Spike IgG was 40d. We observed a high-rate of seropositivity (86%) with 16 pts (14%) having a negative Spike IgG. Percent positivity was not statistically significant between vaccine types (p=0.50). We observed significantly lower seroconversion rates in pts with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (p=0.005) and pts who received: cytotoxic chemotherapy (p=0.002), IVIG (p=0.01), CAR-T cell therapy (p=0.00002), and CD20 monoclonal antibodies (Ab) (p=0.0000008) especially within 6 mo of Spike Ab evaluation (p=0.01). All pts who received anti-CD19 (Axi-cel) CAR-T therapy (0/6) were seronegative, and 1 pt that received BCMA directed CAR-T (Cilta-cel) was seropositive with no association between timing CAR-T cell infusion and seroconversion/titer. Use of BCL2 inhibitors (p=0.04), CD20 monoclonal Ab (p=0.0009), CAR-T cell therapy (p=0.01), BTK inhibitors (p=0.04), current steroid use (p=0.002), and IVIG (p=0.003) also correlated with significantly lower Ab titers with a trend toward lower Ab titers in pts on any active cancer therapy at time of vaccination (p=0.051). Immunomodulatory drugs (p=0.01) and proteasome inhibitors (p=0.01) had significantly higher seroconversion rates, and pts with history prior COVID-19 (12/106) had significantly higher Ab titers (p=0.0003). Of 47 pts who received stem cell transplant, 43 received an autologous (37 seropositive, 6 seronegative) and 4 an allogeneic transplant (3 seropositive, 1 seronegative), with no significant association with seroconversion, Ab titer, or time since transplant (greater or less than 1 year). The majority of pts, 64% and 53%, reported no adverse effects (AE) to the 1st and 2nd dose respectively. The most common AE were mild in severity and included sore arm, muscle aches, fatigue, and fever. No life-threatening AE were observed. Our findings indicate that vaccination is safe, effective, and well tolerated in the majority of pts with hematologic malignancies. We observed that pts receiving B-cell depleting therapies are unable to mount an effective serological response to COVID-19 vaccines and remain vulnerable to the disease. Novel immunization strategies (active or passive) are urgently needed in this population. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination has been effective in protecting against severe COVID-19 infections and related mortality. It is recommended for all individuals including patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, safety data are lacking in this group of patients. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the short- and long-term vaccine related adverse events (AEs) in patients with IBD. Methods: This is a prospective, observational cohort study investigating short- and long-term AEs related to the BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with IBD (study group) after the first and second dose compared to healthy participants (control group). Patients were recruited at the time of attendance to the clinic or infusion rooms. Short term (<3 weeks) localized and systemic AEs were assessed via questionnaire. Follow-up phone-based survey was made to collect data on long term (up to 24 weeks) AEs. Results: A total of 408 patients answered the questionnaires, 204 patients in each group, the study and control group. No serious adverse events were reported in either the study or the control group after the first or the second dose. Participants in the control group reported more frequent pain at the injection site than those in the study group after the first dose [58 (57%) vs. 38 (37%) respectively, P = 0.005]. After the second dose, tiredness was reported more frequently in the control group [49 (48%)] compared to the study group [25 (24%) (P < 0.001)]. At 20–24 weeks post vaccination, 386 out of 408 (94.6%) patients were willing to participate in the follow-up phone based questionnaire [196 (96.1%) in the study group vs. 190 (93.1%) in the control group]. In both groups, none of the patients reported local, systemic, or severe adverse events (0 out of 386) at week 20–24 post second dose. Conclusion: The BNT162b2 vaccine is safe in patients with IBD. No severe or long-term adverse events were reported in our study. The frequency of local and systemic adverse events after the second dose was generally higher among healthy participants compared to patients with IBD. Further studies including a larger cohort with a longer follow-up duration are needed to assess for possible rare adverse events.

N2  - Background/Purpose: The COVID-19 virus has caused significant morbidity and mortality, despite introduction of the COVID vaccine. Immunocompromised patients have been shown to have reduced response to the COVID vaccine compared to healthy individuals. There is currently limited data on the responsiveness of pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients to the COVID vaccine. Methods: To evaluate the effectiveness of the COVID vaccine in generating an antibody response in immunosuppressed pediatric SLE patients, retrospective data were collected for SLE patients 1-21 years of age seen at Children's National Hospital and who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Fully vaccinated was defined as having received at least two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or having received one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Patients were included if they were on immunosuppression at the time of vaccination. Results: Ten patients met inclusion criteria for the study, and all tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG. The average age of the patients was 15.5 ± 3.6 years old. Eight patients were female, and 7 patients identified as Black/African American. One patient had a documented history of COVID infection, whereas the other patients had no prior reported history of COVID infection. All patients had lupus nephritis. At the time of vaccination, 7 were receiving prednisone (1 patient on high dose, 6 patients on steroid wean, average dose 0.39 ± 0.68 mg/kg/d), and 6 were receiving mycophenolate mofetil (average dose 1193 ± 258 mg/m2/d). In addition, 2 patients received belimumab, 1 received rituximab, 1 received tacrolimus, 1 received cyclophosphamide, and 2 received methotrexate. One of the patients receiving methotrexate had active arthritis and was also receiving adalimumab. Two patients (22%) received 2 doses of the Moderna vaccine, 5 patients (56%) received 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, and 2 patients (22%) received 3 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. One patient received dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine prior to receiving immunosuppression. IgG levels were measured at a mean of 91.7 ± 55.4 days after the last COVID vaccine. The mean±SD IgG level for patients who received all vaccine doses while on immunosuppression was 283.5 ± 200.7 AU/mL. Patients who received 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine had slightly lower IgG titers (231 ± 155.1 AU/mL) compared to those who received 2 doses of the Moderna vaccine (297 ± 145 AU/mL). None of the 10 patients had a documented COVID infection post-vaccination. In addition, 3 patients who were diagnosed with SLE and started on immunosuppression post-vaccination also had COVID IgG titers drawn; all had a positive titer at a mean ±SD level of 318.3 ± 418.2 AU/mL. Conclusion: In a small population of pediatric SLE patients on immunosuppression, all patients mounted an appreciable antibody response to the vaccine as demonstrated by positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers. Their titer levels were similar to those of a smaller cohort of SLE patients who were not on immunosuppression at the time of vaccination. These results differ from reduced responses seen in transplant and adult SLE patients. Further studies are needed with a larger cohort of patients.

N2  - The South Korean government has successfully improved influenza vaccination coverage for individuals aged 65 years or older as part of its National Immunization Program (NIP). Those aged 50–64 years without funded vaccination care have significantly lower vaccination rates and face a substantial risk of influenza-related complications. We use a dynamic epidemiological and economic model to investigate the cost-effectiveness of expanding the universal vaccine fund to include those aged 50–64. The epidemiological model is estimated using the susceptibility-infection-recovery model and influenza and influenza-like illness incidence rates, which were calculated by the National Health Insurance Service–National Sample Cohort from the 2008/09 to 2012/13 influenza seasons but excluding the 2009/10 season for pandemic influenza A (H1N1). The decision tree economic model is assessed from societal and healthcare sector perspectives. The proposed policy would eliminate 340,000 annual influenza cases and prevent 119 unnecessary deaths. From a societal perspective, the proposed policy would reduce costs by USD 68 million. From a healthcare perspective, the cost is USD 4318 per quality-adjusted life years. Within the study range, sensitivity analyses found consistent cost-effectiveness results. The influenza vaccine for adults aged 50–64 appears to be cost-saving or cost-effective and, thus, should be considered for the NIP.

N2  - Background: Residents and staff in long-term care facilities have been prioritised for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, but data on potential waning of vaccine effectiveness and the effect of booster doses in this vulnerable population are scarce. We aimed to evaluate effectiveness of one, two, and three vaccine doses against infection and severe clinical outcomes in staff and residents of long-term care facilities in England over the first year following vaccine roll-out. Methods: The VIVALDI study is a prospective cohort study done in 331 long-term care facilities in England. Residents aged 65 years or older and staff aged 18 years or older were eligible for participation. Participants had routine PCR testing throughout the study period between Dec 8, 2020, and Dec 11, 2021. We retrieved all PCR results and cycle threshold values for PCR-positive samples from routine testing in long-term care facilities, and positive PCR results from clinical testing in hospitals through the UK's COVID-19 Datastore. PCR results were linked to participants using pseudo-identifiers based on individuals' unique UK National Health Service (NHS) numbers, which were also used to retrieve vaccination records from the National Immunisation Management Service, hospitalisation records from NHS England, and deaths data from the Office for National Statistics through the COVID-19 Datastore. In a Cox proportional hazards regression, we estimated vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation, and COVID-19-related death after one, two, and three vaccine doses, separately by previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure. This study is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN 14447421. Findings: 80 186 residents and staff of long-term care facilities had records available for the study period, of whom 15 518 eligible residents and 19 515 eligible staff were included in the analysis. For residents without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure, vaccine effectiveness decreased from 61·7% (95% CI 35·1 to 77·4) to 22·0% (–14·9 to 47·0) against infection; from 89·0% (70·6 to 95·9) to 56·3% (30·1 to 72·6) against hospitalisation; and from 96·4% (84·3 to 99·2) to 64·4% (36·1 to 80·1) against death, when comparing 14–83 days after dose two and 84 days or more after dose two. For staff without evidence of previous exposure, vaccine effectiveness against infection decreased slightly from 57·9% (43·1 to 68·9) at 14–83 days after dose two to 42·1% (29·9 to 52·2) at 84 days or more after dose two. There were no hospitalisations or deaths among unexposed staff at 14–83 days, but seven hospitalisations (vaccine effectiveness 91·0% [95% CI 74·3 to 96·8]) and one death were observed at 84 days or more after dose two. High vaccine effectiveness was restored following a third vaccine dose, with vaccine effectiveness in unexposed residents of 72·7% (55·8 to 83·1) against infection, 90·1% (80·6 to 95·0) against hospitalisation, and 97·5% (88·1 to 99·5) against death; and vaccine effectiveness in unexposed staff of 78·2% (70·0 to 84·1) against infection and 95·8% (49·9 to 99·6) against hospitalisation. There were no COVID-19-related deaths among unexposed staff after the third vaccine dose. Interpretation: Our findings showed substantial waning of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectiveness against all outcomes in residents of long-term care facilities from 12 weeks after a primary course of ChAdOx1-S or mRNA vaccines. Boosters restored protection, and maximised immunity across all outcomes. These findings show the importance of boosting and the need for ongoing surveillance in this vulnerable cohort.

N2  - Background Long-term care facilities (LTCF) have been prioritised for vaccination, but data on potential waning of vaccine effectiveness (VE) and the impact of booster doses in this vulnerable population remains scarce. Methods We included residents and staff from 331 LTCFs enrolled in VIVALDI (ISRCTN 14447421), who underwent routine PCR testing between Dec 8, 2020 - Dec 11, 2021 in a Cox proportional hazards regression, estimating VE against SARS-CoV2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation, and COVID-19-related death after 1-3 vaccine doses, stratifying by previous SARS-CoV2 exposure. Results For 15,518 older residents, VE declined from 50·7% (15·5, 71·3) to 17·2% (-23·9, 44·6) against infection; from 85·4% (60·7, 94·.6) to 54·3% (26·2, 71·7) against hospitalisation; and from 94·4% (76·4, 98·7) to 62·8% (32·9, 79·4) against death, when comparing 2-12 weeks and ≥12 weeks after two doses. For 19,515 staff, VE against infection declined slightly from 50·3% (32·7, 63·3) to 42·1% 29·5, 52·4). High VE was restored following a third dose, with VE of 71·6% (53·5, 82·7) and 78·3% (70·1, 84·3) against infection and 89·9% (80·0, 94·6) and 95·8% (50·4, 99·6) against hospitalisation, for residents and staff respectively; and 97·5% (88·1, 99·5) against death for residents. Interpretation Substantial waning of VE is observed against all outcomes in residents from 12 weeks after a primary course of AstraZeneca or mRNA vaccines. Boosters restore protection, and maximise immunity across all outcomes. These findings demonstrate the importance of boosting and the need for ongoing surveillance of VE in this vulnerable cohort.

N2  - Background: Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to reduce risk of infection, as well as severe disease among those with breakthrough infection, in adults. The latter effect is particularly important as Immune evasion by Omicron variants appears to have made vaccines less effective for prevention of infection. There is currently little available information on the protection conferred by vaccination against severe illness due to SARS-CoV-2 in children. Methods: To minimize confounding by changing vaccination practices and dominant circulating viral variants, we performed an age- and time-matched nested case-control design. Reported SARS-CoV-2 case records in Ontario children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 were linked to vaccination records. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the effectiveness of one and two vaccine doses against hospitalization. Results: We identified 130 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 cases and 1,300 non-hospitalized, age- and time-matched controls, with disease onset between May 28, 2021 and January 9, 2022. One vaccine dose was shown to be 34% effective against hospitalization among SARS-CoV-2 cases (aOR = 0.66 [95% CI: 0.34, 1.21]). In contrast, two doses were 56% (aOR = 0.44 [95% CI: 0.23, 0.83]) effective at preventing hospitalization among SARS-CoV-2 cases. Exploratory instrumental variable analyses, and calculation of E-values, suggested that these effects are unlikely to be explained by unmeasured confounding. Conclusions: Even with immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2 variants, two vaccine doses continue to provide protection against hospitalization among adolescent and pediatric SARS-CoV-2 cases, even when the vaccines do not prevent infection.

N2  - Introduction: The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are effective in reducing COVID-19-related severe disease and death. Waning vaccine effectiveness has prompted the recommendation to administer additional (booster) doses. With additional doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines being recommended, it is essential to monitor its safety. Myocarditis has been reported following the second dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. Whether administration of additional doses of COVID-19 vaccines further increases the risk of myocarditis is not known. This study aimed to evaluate whether a third dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was associated with an increased risk of myocarditis in a large population-based cohort in California. Methods: We included individuals who received one to three doses of BNT162b2 (Pfizer) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) mRNA vaccine between 12/14/2020 and 2/18/2022 in an integrated healthcare delivery system in the United States. Hospitalization for myocarditis within 21 days of vaccine administration was identified using electronic medical records. Results: Of 3,076,660 KPSC members who received at least one dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, 2,916,739 (94.5%) received at least two doses, and 1,146,254 (47.0%) received three doses. The IRR for myocarditis was 0.86 (95% CI 0.31-1.93) for the first dose, 4.87 (95% CI 3.14- 7.37) for the second dose, and 2.61 (1.13-5.29) for the third dose. The majority of myocarditis cases following the second and third dose occurred within seven days of vaccination. Conclusion: Myocarditis was a rare but serious event observed after the second or third dose of vaccination. Most cases presented within seven days of vaccination. The incidence of myocarditis following the third dose did not appear to be significantly higher than that observed after the second dose. (Figure Presented).

N2  - During a COVID-19 outbreak in a prison in Zambia from 14th to 19th December 2021, a case control study was done to measure vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection and symptomatic infection, when the Omicron variant was the dominant circulating variant. Among 382 participants, 74.1% were fully vaccinated and the median time since full vaccination was 54 days. There were no hospitalizations or deaths. COVID-19 VE against any SARS-CoV-2 infection was 64.8% and VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was 72.9%. COVID-19 vaccination helped protect incarcerated persons against SARS-CoV-2 infection during an outbreak while Omicron was the dominant variant in Zambia.

N2  - Background: SARS-CoV-2 variant Beta (B.1.351) was designated as a Variant of Concern (VoC) after becoming the dominant strain in South Africa and spreading internationally. BNT162b2 showed lower levels of neutralizing antibodies against Beta than against other strains raising concerns about effectiveness of vaccines against infections caused by Beta. We estimated BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against Beta infections in Israel, a country with high vaccine uptake. Methods: The Ministry of Health (MoH) identified Beta cases through mandatory reporting of SARS-CoV-2 cases and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of specimens from vaccination-breakthrough infections, reinfections, arriving international travelers, and a selection of other infected persons. A cohort analysis was conducted of exposure events of contacts of primary Beta cases. WGS was conducted on available PCR-positive specimens collected from contacts. VE estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) against confirmed and probable Beta infections were determined by comparing infection risk between unvaccinated and fully-vaccinated (≥7 days after the second dose) contacts, and between unvaccinated and partially-vaccinated (<7 days after the second dose) contacts. Findings: MoH identified 310 Beta cases through Jun 27, 2021. During the study period (Dec 11, 2020 – Mar 25, 2021), 164 non-institutionalized primary Beta cases, with 552 contacts aged ≥16 years, were identified. 343/552 (62%) contacts were interviewed and tested. 71/343 (21%) contacts were PCR-positive. WGS was performed on 7/71 (10%) PCR-positive specimens; all were Beta. Among SARS-CoV-2-infected contacts, 48/71 (68%) were symptomatic, 10/71 (14%) hospitalized, and 2/71 (3%) died. Fully-vaccinated VE against confirmed or probable Beta infections was 72% (95% CI -5 – 97%; p=0·04) and against symptomatic confirmed or probable Beta infections was 100% (95% CI 19 – 100%; p=0·01). There was no evidence of protection in partially-vaccinated contacts. Interpretation: In a prospective observational study, two doses of BNT162b2 were effective against confirmed and probable Beta infections. Through the end of June 2021, introductions of Beta did not interrupt control of the pandemic in Israel. Funding: Israel Ministry of Health and Pfizer.

N2  - Data science has been an invaluable part of the COVID-19 pandemic response with multiple applications, ranging from tracking viral evolution to understanding the effectiveness of interventions. Asymptomatic breakthrough infections have been a major problem during the ongoing surge of Delta variant globally. Serological discrimination of vaccine response from infection has so far been limited to Spike protein vaccines used in the higher-income regions. Here, we show for the first time how statistical and machine learning (ML) approaches can discriminate SARS-CoV-2 infection from immune response to an inactivated whole virion vaccine (BBV152, Covaxin, India), thereby permitting real-world vaccine effectiveness assessments from cohort-based serosurveys in Asia and Africa where such vaccines are commonly used. Briefly, we accessed serial data on AntiS and Anti-NC antibody concentration values, along with age, sex, number of doses, and number of days since the last vaccine dose for 1823 Covaxin recipients. An ensemble ML model, incorporating a consensus clustering approach alongside the support vector machine (SVM) model, was built on 1063 samples where reliable qualifying data existed, and then applied to the entire dataset. Of 1448 self-reported negative subjects, 724 were classified as infected. Since the vaccine contains wild-type virus and the antibodies induced will neutralize wild type much better than Delta variant, we determined the relative ability of a random subset of such samples to neutralize Delta versus wild type strain. In 100 of 156 samples, where ML prediction differed from self-reported uninfected status, Delta variant, was neutralized more effectively than the wild type, which cannot happen without infection. The fraction rose to 71.8% (28 of 39) in subjects predicted to be infected during the surge, which is concordant with the percentage of sequences classified as Delta (75.6%-80.2%) over the same period.

N2  - RATIONALE: Effective anti-inflammatory treatment for COVID-19 is required. We have proposed the new method of severe COVID-19 treatment with inhalations of ultra-low (non-cytotoxic) doses of an alkylating drug Melphalan. It is based on the interaction of low doses (100-fold lower than therapeutic ones) of an alkylating drug with cytokine cell receptors (TNF-a, IL-2R, etc) without DNA damage. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy and safety of Melphalan inhalations for COVID-19 pneumonia treatment. METHODS: 120 patients enrolled in prospective, open-label, central assessor blinded, comparative study (NCT04380376) were divided into 2 groups: 60 patients received inhalations of melphalan (MTG) at a dose of 0.1 mg once a day for 7 days and 60 patients of control group (CG) with standard-of care therapy on “case-control” basis. Changes in WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI), blood tests, inflammatory markers and lung CT scans from the first day of inhalation till the end of hospitalization in MTG and same period of time in CG were evaluated. RESULTS: during the study 1 patient in MTG and 2 patients in CG died. According to the OSCI initially patients of MTG had worse condition than CG (3.9 and 3.4 points) (p<0.05). After the treatment, a better clinical effect was registered in MTG than in CG (1.6 and 2.2 points) (p<0.05). MTG patients initially had a larger volume of lung tissue damage on CT scans (31.5 and 25.8%) (p<0.05). After the treatment, there were no significant differences between MTG and CG (23.5 and 20.6%). MTG patients had higher CRP than in CG (88 and 66.3 mg/L) and IL-6 (201.3 and 29.1 pg/ml, respectively) (p<0.05). After the treatment, there were no differences in these variables (15.2 and 16 mg/l, 19 and 6.9 pg/ml, respectively). In MTG platelets increased from 186.3 to 350.1. There were no differences between MTG and CG in the dynamics of biochemical parameters. CONCLUSIONS: According to WHO OSCI, a significantly better clinical effect was revealed in MTG than in CG. While the level of CRP, IL-6 and lung CT scan data were initially worse in MTG, after the treatment there were no significant differences between MTG and CG. No adverse events characteristic for therapeutic doses of melphalan have been registered. In our pilot proof-ofconcept study inhalations of ultra-low doses of melphalan appeared to be effective and save treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Larger prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial is required.

N2  - Introduction: The use of systemic corticosteroids to suppress SARS-CoV-2-induced lung inflammation is advocated in the treatment of COVID-19 ARDS.1,2 Whilst the evidence for low dose early corticosteroids in COVIDARDS is well established, the effect of larger steroid doses (i.e. short-term 'pulse-dose') is yet to be investigated. Objectives: The objective of this study was to examine the effect of pulse dose steroids on ventilatory parameters such as oxygenation in COVID-19 patients with and without established fibrosis or organising pneumonia (OP). Methods: This was a multi-centre, retrospective observational study performed at four teaching hospitals, with the following inclusion criteria: adult patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation with confirmed PCR SARS-CoV-2 infection; and received high dose steroids for treatment for COVID-ARDS (defined as dose ≥ 20mg dexamethasone or an equivalent dose of methylprednisolone). This study was carried out as a service evaluation within the National Health Service (NHS) and recorded under the auspices of the clinical audit office at Imperial College HealthcareNHS Trust and Institutional Data Protection Office. Study patients were followed for 14 days or until they were discharged from the ICU and physiological or ventilatory variable data was retrospectively collected from patient records. Results: In total, 92 patients were included: 14 patients 20mg/day dexamethasone; 5 patients 50mg/day dexamethasone; 16 patients 500mg methylprednisolone; and 57 patients 1000mg methylprednisolone. Our data demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio over time, from baseline to day 14, in those patients who received 1000mg Methylprednisolone (baseline PaO2: 14.47 kPa, Day 3: 17.51 kPa, Day 7: 19.51 kPa, Day 14: 22.87 kPa, p<0.001). Whilst not statistically significant, there was a trend to higher P/F ratios by day 14 in patients who received 500mg Methylprednisolone group. There was no increase in P/F ratios in those patients who received 20mg or 50mg dexamethasone. The increase in P/F ratio was most apparent in those patients who had evidence of fibrosis on CT scan, although some benefit was seen in those patients who did not fibrosis on radiological imaging. Cross sectional random effects models were used to determine the effect of 1000mg methylprednisolone on improvement in P/F ratio and demonstrate that there was an increase of P/F ratio of more than 0.38 kPa per day in those patients that received 1000mg methylprednisolone. The was no significant effect on compliance measures. There was also a trend to more ventilator free days but no difference in mortality in those patients receiving large dose methylprednisolone. Reassuringly, rates of fungal infection and pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum for patients who received steroids, including those with high dose, were equivocal. Conclusion: In this study, we present novel data suggesting that large doses of methylprednisolone may be beneficial in patients with severe COVID-19, late in the disease course when ARDS is well established. This benefit was not demonstrated in patients treated with lesser (but still high) doses of steroids (i.e. 20mg or 50mg of dexamethasone) and suggest that larger pulsed-dose steroids may induce reversibility of the disease process, particularly in those who have developed fibrosis.

N2  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to pose a threat to public health with the potential for the emergence of new variants. Vaccines are the milestones to control and slow down the damage of the pandemic. As of January 2021, a two-dose regimen with CoronaVac was authorized in Turkey. Due to the waning seroprevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2 over time, BNT162b2 or CoronaVac has been administered as the third dose following a two-dose CoronaVac regimen as a national vaccination policy. As of 14 January 2021, 5243 volunteers who received two doses of the CoronaVac vaccine at Hacettepe University Adult Vaccine Center were followed prospectively. In our study, relative vaccine effectiveness (VEff) for the third dose of the CoronaVac was 58.24% and 87.27% for BNT162b2 in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 cases. There were no hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, or deaths in third-dose booster groups with either BNT162b2 or CoronaVac, yielding 100% effectiveness. Both homologous or heterologous third-dose boosters provided further protection against severe COVID-19 and should be prioritized as an effective strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - The term hybrid immunity is used to denote the immunological status of vaccinated individuals with a history of natural infection. Reports of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern motivate continuous rethought and renewal of COVID-19 vaccination programs. We used a naturalistic case-control study design to compare the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to hybrid immunity 180 days post-vaccination in prioritized and non-prioritized populations vaccinated before 31 July 2021 in three Swedish counties (total population 1,760,000). Subjects with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test recorded within 6 months before vaccination (n = 36,247; 6%) were matched to vaccinated-only controls. In the prioritized population exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Delta variants post-vaccination, the odds ratio (OR) for breakthrough infection was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.6–2.8; p < 0.001) in the vaccinated-only group compared with the hybrid immunity group, while in the later vaccinated non-prioritized population, the OR decreased from 4.3 (95% CI, 2.2–8.6; p < 0.001) during circulation of the Delta variant to 1.9 (95% CI, 1.7–2.1; p < 0.001) with the introduction of the Omicron variant (B.1.617.2). We conclude that hybrid immunity provides gains in protection, but that the benefits are smaller for risk groups and with circulation of the Omicron variant and its sublineages.

N2  - Background: COVID-19 vaccines have been crucial in the pandemic response and understanding changes in vaccines effectiveness is essential to guide vaccine policies. Though the Delta variant is no longer dominant, understanding vaccines effectiveness properties will provide essential knowledge to comprehend the development of the pandemic and estimate potential changes over time. Methods: In this population-based cohort study, we estimated vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalisations, intensive care admissions, and death using Cox proportional hazard models, across different vaccine product regimens and age groups, between 15 July and 31 November 2021 (Delta variant period). Vaccine status is included as a time-varying covariate and all models were adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, county of residence, country of birth, and living conditions. Data from the entire adult Norwegian population were collated from the National Preparedness Register for COVID-19 (Beredt C19). Results: The overall adjusted vaccine effectiveness against infection decreased from 81.3% (confidence interval (CI): 80.7 to 81.9) in the first two to nine weeks after receiving a second dose to 8.6% (CI:4.0 to 13.1) after more than 33 weeks, compared to 98.6% (CI: 97.5 to 99.2) and 66.6% (CI: 57.9 to 73.6) against hospitalisation respectively. After the third dose (booster), the effectiveness was 75.9% (CI: 73.4 to 78.1) against infection and 95.0% (CI: 92.6 to 96.6) against hospitalisation. Spikevax or a combination of mRNA products provided the highest protection, but the vaccine effectiveness decreased with time since vaccination for all vaccine regimens. Conclusions: Even though the vaccine effectiveness against infection wanes over time, all vaccine regimens remained effective against hospitalisation after the second vaccine dose. For all vaccine regimens, a booster facilitated recovery of effectiveness. The results from this support the use of heterologous schedules, increasing flexibility in vaccination policy.

N2  - Background: SARS-CoV-2 vaccines show high effectiveness against infection and (severe) disease. However, few studies estimate population level vaccine effectiveness against multiple COVID-19 outcomes, by age and including homologous and heterologous vaccine regimens. Methods: Using Cox proportional hazard models on data from 4 293 544 individuals (99% of Norwegian adults), we estimated overall, age-, and product-specific vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisation, ICU admission and death in Norway, using data from national registries. Vaccine status was included as time-dependent variable and we adjusted for sex, pre-existing medical conditions, country of birth, county of residence, and crowded living conditions. Findings: Adjusted vaccine effectiveness among fully vaccinated is 72·1% (71·2‒73·0) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 92·9% (91·2‒94·2) against hospitalisation, 95·5% (92·6‒97·2) against ICU admission, and 88·0% (82·5‒91·8) against death. Among partially vaccinated, the effectiveness is 24·3% (22·3‒26·2) against infection and 82·7% (77·7‒86·6) against hospitalisation. Vaccine effectiveness against infection is 84·7% (83·1-86·1) for heterologous mRNA vaccine regimens, 78·3% (76·8-79·7) for Spikevax (Moderna; mRNA-1273), 69·7% (68·6-70·8) for Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech; BNT162b2), and 60·7% (57·5-63·6) for Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca; ChAdOx nCoV-19; AZD1222) with a mRNA dose among fully vaccinated. Interpretation: We demonstrate good protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease in fully vaccinated, including heterologous vaccine regimens, which could facilitate rapid immunization. Partially vaccinated were less likely to get severe disease than unvaccinated, though protection against infection was not as high, which could be essential in making vaccine prioritisation policies especially when availability is limited.

N2  - Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is associated with higher thrombotic risk and enhanced thrombin generation (TG) in adults. IBD patients were underrepresented in SARS-CoV- 2 mRNA vaccine trials. Case reports indicated that adverse events post-vaccination, including IBD flare, were more common among children, and those with prior COVID-19. Aims: To find out whether TG is increased in children with IBD as compared to healthy controls and whether TG parameters show significant changes following SARS-CoV- 2 mRNA vaccination. Methods: In this observational case-control study, 37 children with IBD (CD:16, UC: 21) aged 12-18 years and 55 healthy age-matched children were enrolled. Blood was collected before and 2-4 weeks after the second dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine dose. Whole blood count, fibrinogen, inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin), anti-SARS- CoV- 2 antibody levels were investigated, TG assay was carried-out using platelet-poor plasma. Lag time, endogen thrombin potential (ETP), peak thrombin, time-to- peak were calculated. Detailed clinical parameters including post-vaccination symptoms, COVID-19 history, disease activity scores (PUCAI, Mayo score, PCDAI) were registered. Results: CRP was significantly elevated in children with IBD and showed a positive correlation with ETP (CD: R = 0.700; p = 0.003 and CU: R = 0.501; p = 0.020). TG parameters did not differ between patients and controls pre-or post-vaccination. TG parameters remained unaltered post-vaccination in both groups. IBD disease flare was not observed post-vaccination, but reduced anti-SARS- CoV- 2 antibody titers were found in 4 patients receiving immunosuppressive therapies. Previous COVID-19 infection had no effect on TG levels. Conclusion(s): Although TG parameters correlated with the level of inflammation in children with IBD, the extent of TG was not significantly different from healthy controls. TG parameters and IBD disease activity scores did not increase significantly following mRNA vaccination. Our results support the safety of SARS-CoV- 2 mRNA vaccination in children with IBD, highlighting observations of lower antibody titers in immunosuppressed children.

N2  - Background Successive SARS-CoV-2 variants have caused severe disease in long-term care facility (LTCF) residents. Primary vaccination provides strong short-term protection, but data are limited on duration of protection following booster vaccines, particularly against the Omicron variant. We investigated effectiveness of booster vaccination against infections, hospitalisations and deaths among LTCF residents and staff in England. Methods We included residents and staff of LTCFs within the VIVALDI study (ISRCTN 14447421) who underwent routine, asymptomatic testing (December 12 2021-March 31 2022). Cox regression was used to estimate relative hazards of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and associated hospitalisation and death at 0-13, 14-48, 49-83 and 84 days after dose 3 of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination compared to 2 doses (after 84+ days), stratified by previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and adjusting for age, sex, LTCF capacity and local SARS-CoV-2 incidence. Results 14175 residents and 19973 staff were included. In residents without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, infection risk was reduced 0-83 days after first booster, but no protection was apparent after 84 days. Additional protection following booster vaccination waned, but was still present at 84+ days for COVID-associated hospitalisation (aHR: 0.47, 0.24-0.89) and death (aHR: 0.37, 0.21-0.62). Most residents (64.4%) had received primary course of AstraZeneca, but this did not impact on pre- or post-booster risks. Staff showed a similar pattern of waning booster effectiveness against infection, with few hospitalisations and no deaths. Conclusions Booster vaccination provides sustained protection against severe outcomes following infection with the Omicron variant, but no protection against infection from 3 months onwards. Ongoing surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in LTCFs is crucial.

N2  - Vaccine breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections necessitating hospitalization have emerged as a relevant problem with longer time interval since vaccination and the predominance of the Delta variant. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between primary vaccination with four SARS-CoV-2 vaccines authorized for use in the European Union—BNT162b2, ChAdOx-1S, mRNA-1273 or Ad.26.COV2.S—and progression to critically severe disease (mechanical ventilation or death) and duration of hospitalization among adult patients with PCR-confirmed acute COVID-19 hospitalized during the Delta variant predominance (October–November 2021) in Slovenia. Among the 529 enrolled patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (median age, 65 years; 58.2% men), 175 (33.1%) were fully vaccinated at the time of symptom onset. Compared with 345 unvaccinated patients, fully vaccinated patients with breakthrough infections were older, more often immunocompromised, and had higher Charlson comorbidity index scores. After adjusting for sex, age, and comorbidities, fully vaccinated patients had lower odds for progressing to critically severe disease and were discharged from the hospital earlier than unvaccinated patients. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 remains an extremely effective intervention to alleviate morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients.

N2  - Malaysia rolled out a diverse portfolio of predominantly three COVID-19 vaccines (AZD1222, BNT162b2, and CoronaVac) beginning 24 February 2021. We evaluated vaccine effectiveness with two methods, covering 1 April to 15 September 2021: (1) the screening method for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and symptomatic COVID-19; and (2) a retrospective cohort of confirmed COVID-19 cases for COVID-19 related ICU admission and death using logistic regression. The screening method estimated partial vaccination to be 48.8% effective (95% CI: 46.8, 50.7) against COVID-19 infection and 33.5% effective (95% CI: 31.6, 35.5) against symptomatic COVID-19. Full vaccination is estimated at 87.8% effective (95% CI: 85.8, 89.7) against COVID-19 infection and 85.4% effective (95% CI: 83.4, 87.3) against symptomatic COVID-19. Among the cohort of confirmed COVID-19 cases, partial vaccination with any of the three vaccines is estimated at 31.3% effective (95% CI: 28.5, 34.1) in preventing ICU admission, and 45.1% effective (95% CI: 42.6, 47.5) in preventing death. Full vaccination with any of the three vaccines is estimated at 79.1% effective (95% CI: 77.7, 80.4) in preventing ICU admission and 86.7% effective (95% CI: 85.7, 87.6) in preventing deaths. Our findings suggest that full vaccination with any of the three predominant vaccines (AZD1222, BNT162b2, and CoronaVac) in Malaysia has been highly effective in preventing COVID-19 infection, symptomatic COVID-19, COVID-19-related ICU admission, and death.

N2  - Background: Real-world evidence on effectiveness of booster or additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine is limited. Methods: Using patient-level data from 50 sites in the U.S. National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), we estimated COVID-19 booster vaccine effectiveness compared to full vaccination alone (completed 2 doses mRNA or 1 dose Janssen vaccine). At each month following full vaccination, we created comparable cohorts of patients with boosters propensity-score matched to those without boosters by age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, geographic region, prior COVID-19 infection, and calendar month of full vaccination. Booster efficacy was evaluated among patients with and without immunosuppressed/compromised conditions (ISC; HIV infection, solid organ or bone marrow transplant, autoimmune diseases, and cancer). We used Cox regression models to estimate hazards of breakthrough infection (COVID-19 diagnosis after last dose of vaccine) and logistic regression models to compare the risk of death ≤45 days after a breakthrough infection in the boosted vs. matched non-boosted groups. Results: By 11/18/2021, 656390 patients had received full vaccination, and 125409 fully vaccinated had received an additional booster (median time from last vaccine to booster dose: 7.4 months, IQR:6.6, 8.2). At completion of full vaccination, median age was 50 (IQR 33-64) years, 43% male, 50% white, 11% Black, 18% Latinx, 4.8% Asian American/Pacific Islander, and 20% had ISC. People receiving a booster were more likely to be older, male, white, and have ISC. Booster vaccine was significantly associated with a reduced hazard of breakthrough infection (Table). Booster efficacy ranged from 46% (booster receipt 1-4 months after full vaccination) to 83% (receipt 7 months after full vaccination) in people without ISC. Vaccine efficacy was lower, ranging from 43%-65%, in ISC patients (Table). Compared to fully vaccinated patients without booster receipt, patients with booster had an 83% (OR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.28) reduced risk of COVID-19 related death, independent of demographics, geographic region, comorbidities, ISC, prior COVID-19 infection, and time of full vaccination. Conclusion: A booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine has high effectiveness in reducing breakthrough infection risk among all fully vaccinated individuals, though only with moderate effectiveness among ISC patients. Nonetheless, booster vaccination significantly reduced risk for COVID-19 related death regardless of ISC status.

N2  - The objective of this study is to explore the real-world effectiveness of various vaccine regimens to tackle the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Delta variant in Thailand during September–December 2021. We applied a test-negative case control study, using nationwide records of people tested for SARS-CoV-2. Each case was matched with two controls with respect to age, detection date, and specimen collection site. A conditional logistic regression was performed. Results were presented in the form vaccine effectiveness (VE) and 95% confidence interval. A total of 1,460,458 observations were analyzed. Overall, the two-dose heterologous prime-boost, ChAdOx1 + BNT162b2 and CoronaVac + BNT162b2, manifested the largest protection level (79.9% (74.0–84.5%) and 74.7% (62.8–82.8%)) and remained stable over the whole study course. The three-dose schedules (CoronaVac + CoronaVac + ChAdOx1, and CoronaVac + CoronaVac + BNT162b2) expressed very high degree of VE estimate (above 80.0% at any time interval). Concerning severe infection, almost all regimens displayed very high VE estimate. For the two-dose schedules, heterologous prime-boost regimens seemed to have slightly better protection for severe infection relative to homologous regimens. Campaigns to expedite the rollout of third-dose booster shot should be carried out. Heterologous prime-boost regimens should be considered as an option to enhance protection for the entire population.

N2  - Background: Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has been included in the national COVID-19 vaccination program in Indonesia since January 2021. The study aims to assess the impacts of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine on infection, hospitalization, and death among adult population aged ≥18 years in Bali, Indonesia. Methods: Test-negative, case control study was conducted by linking SARS-CoV-2 laboratory records, vaccination, and health administrative data for the period of January 13 to June 30, 2021. Case-subjects were defined as individuals who had a positive RT-PCR test for SARSCoV-2 during the period; they were matched with controls (tested negative) (1:1) based on age, sex, district of residence, and week of testing. We estimated the odds of vaccination in PCR confirmed, hospitalization and death due to COVID-19, accounting for the presence of comorbidities and prior infection. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as (1-odds ratio) x 100%. Results: Total 109,050 RT-PCR test results were retrieved during the January 13 to June 30, 2021. Of these, 14,168 subjects were eligible for inclusion in the study. Total 5518 matched case-control pairs were analyzed. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) against laboratory-confirmed SARSCoV-2 infection was 14.5% (95% confidence interval -11 to 34.2) at 0-13 days after the first dose; 66.7% (95% CI: 58.1- 73.5) at ≥14 days after the second dose. The adjusted effectiveness against hospitalization and COVID-19-associated death was 71.1% (95% CI: 62.9-77.6) and 87.4% (95% CI: 65.1-95.4%) at ≥14 days after receiving the second dose, respectively. Conclusions: Two-dose of inactivated CoronaVac vaccine showed high effectiveness against laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and death associated with COVID-19 among adults aged ≥18 years.

N2  - Background: Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine booster effectiveness is essential as new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge. Data support the effectiveness of boosters in preventing severe disease and hospitalization; however, the real-world impact on reducing incident SARS-CoV-2 infections across specific variants is not yet clear. Objectives: Assess the impact of COVID-19 boosters on protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a real-world setting from a highly vaccinated (99%) population curated from a linked database with test results, vaccination history, patient demographics, and genomic sequencing information from the National Basketball Association (NBA). Methods: In this population, 1,613 fully vaccinated staff and players (median age 34.5 years, 88% male) who tested at least once between 1 December 2021 and 5 January 2022, were analyzed. Individuals were tested at the time of reporting any symptom, regardless of severity, after known exposure per self-report or contact tracing and/or during enhanced surveillance. Boosted individuals (n=1260) were compared to fully vaccinated and booster eligible individuals (n=162), defined as 2 months post-JNJ-78436735 or 5-months post-second dose of mRNA vaccine. Individuals not yet eligible for a booster and those who recovered from COVID-19 between 1 November and 30 November, 2021 (n=25) were examined in secondary analyses but excluded from the primary comparison. Individuals who were not fully vaccinated (n=27) or who received a booster within 14 days during or prior to the observation period (n=916) were excluded. Results: In this closely monitored population, fully vaccinated booster-eligible individuals were 2.6 times more likely (RR = 2.6, 95% CI: 2.2 to 3.0, p<0.0001) to have a confirmed COVID-19 infection than boosted individuals. Secondary analysis including non-boosted individuals with recent vaccination or recent SARSCoV-2 infection found that non-boosted individuals were at greater risk of infection compared with boosted individuals (RR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.8 to 2.4, p<0.001). Results were similar when stratified by primary vaccination type with overlapping confidence intervals. No hospitalizations or deaths were observed in this cohort. Genetic sequencing confirmed 93% of infections to be Omicron (among n=330 sequenced). Conclusions: These results highlight the protective benefit of boosters against incident SARS-CoV-19 infection, not only for severe symptoms and death. Assessment of booster effectiveness remains vital for COVID-19 vaccines as new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge, as there is still uncertainty around performance in real-world settings. These data are needed to convince the general public that boosters remain effective at preventing in the spread of COVID-19.

N2  - Purpose/Objective(s): Studies have suggested that prior radiation dose to normal lung tissue is associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes. However, radiation dose to the heart may be an equally important consideration, given the impact of COVID-19 on cardiovascular/thrombotic complications, and of cardiac dose on overall mortality after breast and lung radiation therapy. We hypothesized that prior heart radiation dose is independently associated with COVID-related mortality (CRM) after adjusting for prior lung radiation dose among COVID-19 positive patients. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the plans of the first 203 patients with a history of radiation therapy in our department to have a documented episode of COVID-19 infection resulting in either death or resolution. For non-metastatic patients with complete treatment plan information and a simulation scan including the entirety of the heart and lungs, we calculated mean bilateral lung dose (MLD [Gy]), bilateral lung V5 (LV5 [%]) and V20 (LV20 [%]), mean heart dose (MHD [Gy]), heart V5 (HV5 [%]), and V30 (HV30 [%]). Each dosimetric parameter was dichotomized at the upper tercile. Our primary endpoint was CRM. The relationship between dosimetric parameters and mortality was evaluated by univariable chi-square analysis and multivariable logistic regression with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Of the 203 patients with documented COVID-19 infection included in our study, 37 experienced CRM (18%). Of the 53 non-metastatic dosimetrically evaluable patients comprising the study cohort, 9 experienced CRM (17%). The most common sites of disease in the study cohort were breast (N = 34), among whom 3 patients (9%) experienced CRM, and lung/thoracic (N = 11), among whom 4 (36%) experienced CRM. In the study cohort, median lung doses were MLD 4.7 Gy, LV5 17.9%, and LV20 8.0%; median heart doses were MHD 1.8 Gy, HV5 2.9%, and HV30 0.1%. On univariable analysis, CRM was higher for patients with MLD ≥7.2 Gy vs. < 7.2 Gy (33.3% vs. 8.6%, P = 0.033), LV5 ≥25.9% vs. < 25.9% (33.3% vs. 8.6%, P = 0.033), MHD ≥2.9 Gy vs. < 2.9 Gy (41.2% vs. 5.6%, P < 0.005), HV5 ≥9.4% vs. < 9.4% (38.9% vs. 5.7%, P = 0.007), and HV30 ≥1.9% vs. < 1.9% (41.2% vs. 5.6%, P = 0.005). Multivariable analysis showed in one model that MHD ≥2.9 Gy vs. < 2.9 Gy was associated with CRM (OR 8.7, CI 1.4-51.9, P = 0.02) while MLD ≥7.2 Gy vs. < 7.2 Gy was not (OR 2.9, CI 0.5-15.8, P = 0.22), and in another model that HV5 ≥9.4% vs. < 9.4% was associated with CRM (OR 7.4, CI 1.2-45.0, P = 0.03) while LV5 ≥25.9% vs. < 25.9% was not (OR 2.2, CI 0.4-13.1, P = 0.37). Conclusion: Prior heart radiation dose appeared to serve as a better predictor of COVID-related mortality than prior lung radiation dose. Future studies of the relationship between radiation therapy and COVID outcomes should include measures of heart exposure, especially given the known cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19.

N2  - Background: Studies have shown that COVID-19 vaccination is effective at preventing infection and death in older populations. However, whether vaccination effectiveness is reduced in patients with frailty is unclear. We aimed to compare vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation and death after COVID-19 during the surge of the delta (B.1.617.2) variant of SARS-CoV-2 according to patients' frailty status. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we used data derived from the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities and the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) COVID-19 Shared Data Resource, which contains information from the VA National Surveillance Tool, death certificates, and National Cemetery Administration. We included veterans aged 19 years or older who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR or antigen tests between July 25 and Sept 30, 2021, with no record of a previous positive test. Deaths were identified through VHA facilities, death certificates, and National Cemetery Administration data available from VA databases. We also retrieved data including sociodemographic characteristics, medical conditions diagnosed at baseline, frailty score, and vaccination information. The primary outcomes were COVID-19-associated hospitalisations and all-cause deaths at 30 days from testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. The odds ratio (OR) for COVID-19-associated hospitalisation and hazard ratio (HR) for death of vaccinated patients compared with the unvaccinated patients were estimated according to frailty categories of robust, pre-frail, or frail. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as 1 minus the OR for COVID-19-associated hospitalisation, and 1 minus the HR for death. Findings: We identified 57 784 veterans (mean age 57·5 years [SD 16·7], 50 642 [87·6%] males, and 40 743 [70·5%] White people), of whom 28 497 (49·3%) were categorised as robust, 16 737 (29·0%) as pre-frail, and 12 550 (21·7%) as frail. There were 2577 all-cause deaths (676 [26·2%] in the vaccinated group and 1901 [73·8%] in the unvaccinated group), and 7857 COVID-19-associated hospitalisations (2749 [35·0%] in the vaccinated group and 5108 [65·0%] in the unvaccinated group) within 30 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-associated hospitalisation within 30 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was 65% (95% CI 61–69) in the robust group, 54% (48–58) in the pre-frail group, and 36% (30–42) in the frail group. By 30 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, the vaccine effectiveness for all-cause death was 79% (95% CI 74–84) in the robust group, 79% (75–83) in the pre-frail group, and 68% (63–71) in the frail group. Interpretation: Compared with non-frail patients (pre-frail and robust), those with frailty had lower levels of vaccination protection against COVID-19-associated hospitalisation and all-cause death. Future studies investigating COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness should incorporate frailty assessments and actively recruit older adults with frailty.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 delta variant became the predominant strain in the USA during the summer of 2021, contributing to increased breakthrough of COVID-19 cases. Despite reduced VE against symptomatic infections due to the delta variant, vaccines are still highly effective against severe COVID-19 infections. Research evidence suggests that frailty, a common condition in older adults may hinder vaccines effectiveness. Frailty represents a state of vulnerability to stressors characterized by chronic, low-grade, inflammation associated with multisystemic dysfunction leading to poor clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare the VE against COVID-19 associated hospitalization and death in older Veterans. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study including US Veterans who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from July 25th to September 15th, 2021. Frailty was operationalized with a 31-item VA Frailty Index (VA-FI) generated based on the number of EHR variables (morbidity, sensory loss, cognition/mood, etc). The VA-FI categorized Veterans into robust (FI<0.10), pre-frail (FI 0.10-0.21), and Frail (FI ≥0.21). After adjusting for age, BMI, race, ethnicity, gender, COPD, CVD, CKD, VE was assessed for robust, pre-frail, and Frail Veterans by logistic regression: COVID-19 related hospitalization or death as dependent variables, and vaccination status as the independent variable. Results: 36749 Veterans were included, 3725 (37.3%) of whom were fully vaccinated at the time of COVID-19 infection, mean age 56.6(SD=16.6), 87.7% (n= 32219) male, 68.3% (n=25,084) Caucasian, 84.6% (n=31,075), non-Hispanic, 49.5% (n=18,173) robust, 27.2% (n=9,988) pre-frail, and 23.4% (n=8,588) frail. Being vaccinated was associated with a 65% reduction in the odds of being hospitalized in the robust (OR=0.35, 95% CI: 0.31-0.40), whereas 31% had a reduction in the frail (OR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.63-0.76). Similarly, vaccination was associated with a 65% reduction in the odds of death in the robust (OR=0.35, 95% CI: 0.31-0.40), compared with a 31% reduction in the frail (OR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.63-0.76). Conclusions: This study shows reduced vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 severe outcomes in patients with frailty. Future studies should investigate strategies to increase the immunogenicity of COVID 19 vaccines in older adults with frailty.

N2  - Vaccination has proven effective against infection with SARS-CoV-2, as well as death and hospitalisation following COVID-19 illness. However, little is known about the effect of vaccination on other acute and post-acute outcomes of COVID-19. Data were obtained from the TriNetX electronic health records network (over 81 million patients mostly in the USA). Using a retrospective cohort study and time-to-event analysis, we compared the incidences of COVID-19 outcomes between individuals who received a COVID-19 vaccine (approved for use in the USA) at least 2 weeks before SARS-CoV-2 infection and propensity score-matched individuals unvaccinated for COVID-19 but who had received an influenza vaccine. Outcomes were ICD-10 codes representing documented COVID-19 sequelae in the 6 months after a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (recorded between January 1 and August 31, 2021). Associations with the number of vaccine doses (1 vs. 2) and age (< 60 vs. ≥ 60 years-old) were assessed. Among 10,024 vaccinated individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 9479 were matched to unvaccinated controls. Receiving at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose was associated with a significantly lower risk of respiratory failure, ICU admission, intubation/ventilation, hypoxaemia, oxygen requirement, hypercoagulopathy/venous thromboembolism, seizures, psychotic disorder, and hair loss (each as composite endpoints with death to account for competing risks; HR 0.70-0.83, Bonferroni-corrected p<.05), but not other outcomes, including long-COVID features, renal disease, mood, anxiety, and sleep disorders. Receiving 2 vaccine doses was associated with lower risks for most outcomes. Associations between prior vaccination and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection were marked in those < 60 years-old, whereas no robust associations were observed in those ≥ 60 years-old. In summary, COVID-19 vaccination is associated with lower risk of several, but not all, COVID-19 sequelae in those with breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. These benefits of vaccination were clear in younger people but not in the over-60s. The findings may inform service planning, contribute to forecasting public health impacts of vaccination programmes, and highlight the need to identify additional interventions for COVID-19 sequelae.

N2  - A number of studies reported that influenza vaccination is associated with lower risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and/or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) morbidity and mortality. We conducted a matched, test-negative, case-control study to estimate effectiveness of influenza vaccination, using Abbott’s quadrivalent Influvac Tetra vaccine, against SARS-CoV-2 infection and against severe COVID-19. The study was implemented on a population of 30,774 healthcare workers (HCWs) in Qatar during the 2020 annual influenza vaccination campaign, between September 17, 2020 and December 31, 2020, before introduction of COVID-19 vaccination. The median age in the matched samples was 36 years (interquartile range (IQR), 32-44) for cases and 35 years (IQR, 32-42) for controls. The median duration between influenza vaccination and the PCR test was 43 days (IQR, 29-62). The estimated effectiveness of influenza vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection >14 days after receiving the vaccine was 29.7% (95% CI: 5.5- 47.7%). The estimated effectiveness of influenza vaccination against any severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was 88.9% (95% CI: 4.1-98.7%). Sensitivity analyses confirmed main analysis results. Recent influenza vaccination is associated with an appreciable reduction in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity.

N2  - Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (Covid-19) was first identified at Wuhan, China in 2019. Since then it has become a pandemic and poses a huge threat to global health. In order to curb this, the Malaysian government has implemented the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme since February 2021, prioritising high risk individuals including the end stage kidney disease (ESKD). However, the efficacy of Covid-19-vaccination in this population has limited evidence. Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of Covid-19-vaccination amongst ESKD. Methods: This is a single centre prospective observational study, reviewing data of adult ESKD patients with covid-19 infection admitted to nephrology ward in Hospital Selayang, Malaysia from 15thJuly 2021 till 14thAugust 2021. Demographic and clinical information were extracted from electronic medical records. Disease severity is classified as mild disease ( category 1-3) and severe disease ( category 4-5). Clinical outcome is defined as alive or death upon discharge. NHS Covid-19 Decision Support Tool score (NHS Score) developed to assist triaging and resource allocation based on age, gender, frailty scale and comorbidities; score of more than 8 is associated with poor prognosis. Clinical frailty scale of 1 to 3 is classified as fit and more than 3 as frail. Multiple logistics regression was performed to identify the odds of full vaccination in disease severity and in-hospital mortality. Data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistic version 26 with p<0.05 considered as significant. Results: A total of 95 patients were identified, with mean age of 57 ± 12.5 years and 68.4% of them are fit (1-3) based on clinical frailty scale. Majority on haemodialysis as renal replacement therapy (RRT) (n=88, 92.6%), predominated by male (n=56, 58.9%) and 60% were Malay (n=57). For vaccination status, 36.8% (n=35) of this cohort completed 2 doses of vaccination, 28.4% (n=27) received 1stdose and 34.7%(n=33) were vaccination-naïve. Upon admission, 65.3%(n=62) were in severe disease and 36.8% (n=35) has NHS Score of more than 8. None of the severe disease received immunomodulator. Full vaccination status was found to be significantly associated with mitigation of severe Covid-19 disease after adjusting for possible confounding factors (adjusted Odds ratio [aOR] 0.167, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.066-0.421), equivalent to vaccine effectiveness of 83.3%. Age, gender, ethnicity, clinical frailty scale, mode of RRT and NHS score are not significantly associated with disease severity. In-ward mortality was significantly associated with Covid-19 disease severity (aOR 0.107, CI 0.028-0.408) with p=0.001 and vaccination status (aOR 0.209, CI 0.066-0.668) with p=0.008. Full vaccination had reduced risk of death by 79%. ESKD with mild disease had a lower risk of death by 89% compared with those with severe disease. Age, frailty score, NHS score, ethnicity, mode of RRT and gender are not significantly associated with mortality. Conclusions: Adult ESKD patients whom completed 2 doses of vaccination has significant good clinical outcome with mild disease and lower risk for in-hospital mortality. No conflict of interest

N2  - Aims: To assess the COVID-19 vaccine understanding, attitudes and hesitancy in renal transplant recipients prior to vaccination. Background: Transplant recipients are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is currently a major public health concern. Methods: An anonymous 'COVID-19 vaccine understanding, and attitudes' online survey was distributed to kidney transplant recipients at our centre. Participants were categorised by intention to have the vaccine: yes, no and undecided. Comparisons were made between the yes and undecided (hesitant) groups. Results: Of 876 surveys sent, 473 recipients responded (response rate 54%). 346 (73.15%), and 105 (22.20%) recipients were in the yes and undecided categories respectively (no group 22 (4.65%) are not considered further). Yes and undecided groups were similarly concerned about their risk of COVID-19 infection. Relative to the yes group, the undecided group were younger (mean age 58.53, SD 12.09 vs.54.69, SD 12.49, p = 0.005), but were not different in other characteristics including gender, education level, occupation status, transplant duration or comorbidities (p-value>0.05 for all). The undecided group felt less positive about the vaccine, less relief it was available and had greater concerns about vaccine safety, effectiveness, and potential side effects (p-values all <0.001). The undecided group also felt more need for vaccine specific information and a recommendation from their nephrologist before committing to vaccination (p < 0.001). Recipients ranked mask wearing, handwashing, and social distancing (both individually and collectively) more effective in reducing COVID-19 infection risk than vaccination (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Vaccine hesitant recipients had concerns pertaining to vaccine safety and effectiveness. Vaccine specific information and a recommendation from their Nephrologist were identified as mechanisms to increase vaccine acceptance in this cohort.

N2  - Background: Optimum formulation of Biological E’s CORBEVAX™ vaccine that contains protein sub unit of Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from the spike protein of SARS-COV-2 formulated with aluminum hydroxide (Al3+) and CpG1018 as adjuvants was selected in phase-1 and 2 studies and proven to be safe, well tolerated and immunogenic in healthy adult population. In the current study, additional data was generated to determine immunogenic superiority of CORBEVAX™ vaccine over COVISHIELD™ vaccine and safety in larger and older population. Methods: This is a phase III prospective, single blinded, randomized, active controlled study (CTRI/2021/08/036074) conducted at 20 sites across India in healthy adults aged between 18-80 years. This study has two arms; immunogenicity arm and safety arm. Participants in immunogenicity arm were randomized equally to either CORBEVAX™TM or COVISHIELD™ vaccination groups to determine the immunogenic superiority. Healthy adults without a history of Covid-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection, were enrolled. Findings: The safety profile of CORBEVAX™ vaccine was comparable to the comparator vaccine COVISHIELD™ in terms of overall AE rates, related AE rates and medically attended AEs. Majority of reported AEs were mild in nature, and overall CORBEVAX™ appeared to cause fewer local and systemic adverse reactions/events. Overall, two grade-3 serious AEs (Dengue fever and femur fracture) were reported and they are unrelated to study vaccine. Neutralizing Antibody titers, against both Ancestral and Delta strain, induced post two-dose vaccination regimen were higher in the CORBEVAX™ arm as compared to COVISHIELD™ and the analysis of GMT ratios demonstrated immunogenic superiority of CORBEVAX™ in comparison with COVISHIELD™. Both CORBEVAX™ and COVISHIELD™ vaccines showed comparable seroconversion post vaccination when assessed against anti-RBD IgG response. The subjects in CORBEVAX™ cohort also exhibited higher Interferon-gamma secreting PBMC’s post stimulation with SARS-COV-2 RBD peptides than the subjects in COVISHIELD™ cohort. Interpretations: Neutralizing antibody titers induced by CORBEVAX™ vaccine against Delta and Ancestral strains were protective, indicative of vaccine effectiveness of >90% for prevention of symptomatic infections based on the Correlates of Protection assessment performed during Moderna and Astra-Zeneca vaccine Phase III studies. Safety findings revealed that CORBEVAX™ vaccine has excellent safety profile when tested in larger and older population.

N2  - Introduction: Vaccination is the most effective method to prevent and control the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recommendations consider patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), a high-priority population to COVID-19 vaccine administration. There were a lot of concerns about vaccination safety in the setting of biological and immunomodulatory drugs. The purpose of this study was to present data on safety about anti-SARSCoV- 2 vaccination in a cohort of IBD patients. These are data of an ongoing multicenter study assessing effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with IBD treated with immunomodulatory or biological drugs (ESCAPE-IBD) sponsored by the Italian Group for the study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IG-IBD - ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04769258). Aims & Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was administrated to 809 IBD patients. Afterwards completed vaccination, telephone or in-person interviews were conducted from February to July 2021 by gastroenterologists from referral center to report local and/or systemic adverse events (AEs) related to vaccination. Data on medical history and treatment was collected from electronic health records. Of these 809, 346 patients were surveyed on the pandemic burden and the main reason for hesitancy in Covid-19 vaccination. Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between disease-related characteristics and the onset of AEs. Results: 809 patients, 456 CD and 353 UC, regularly followed in IBD unit, were enrolled. All patients received a complete SARS-CoV-2 vaccination cycle. Most of them (68%) were in biological or immunomodulatory therapy. About 45% of patients had at least one side effect, following the first dose (10%), the second (15%) or both doses (20%). Local pain at site of injection (24%), fatigue (33%) and fever (30%) were the three most common AEs. Flares of the underlying IBD were not reported. The vast majority of AE were mild and lasted only a few days. No serious AEs were reported and no patient was hospitalized. Logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender (p<0.001), younger age (p=0.001), seroconversion (p=0.002) and comorbidity (p<0.001) were significantly associated with the occurrence of AEs. Futhermore the survey showed that the pandemic did not affect IBD at all in 37.5%, and a lot in 9.2% of participants. The majority (95%) of patients welcomed the possibility of getting vaccinated; only 7% feared the vaccine's influence on the course of the IBD. The main concerns were the possibility of adverse effects (33%) and the failure to achieve immunity (17%), few for the type of vaccine (3%) and for the need to a further booster (6%). Almost all patients (99%) felt safer to have vaccinated at their IBD reference center. Conclusion: The short-term vaccine reactions experienced in this cohort of IBD patients were mostly self-limiting, including local pain at the injection site, fatigue and fever. We found a high acceptance rate and a good safety profile of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in our cohort.

Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech®) in two shots were administrated to 427 IBD patients. Afterwards completed vaccination, telephone or in-person interviews were conducted from February to July 2021 by gastroenterologists from referral center to report local and/or systemic adverse events (AEs) related to vaccination. Data on medical history and treatment was collected from electronic health records. Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between diseaserelated characteristics and the onset of AEs. Results: 427 patients, 252 CD and 175 UC, were enrolled. All patients received two shots of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. AEs were more common in females (70% vs 50% male gender; p<0.001). Most of them (75%) were in biological or immunomodulatory therapy. About 58% of patients had at least one side effect, following the first dose (13%), the second (22%) or both doses (23%). Local pain at site of injection (31%), fatigue (19%) and fever (15%) were the three most common AEs. Flares of the underlying IBD were not reported. The vast majority of AE were mild and lasted only a few days. No serious AEs were reported and no patient was hospitalized. Logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender (p<0.001) and younger age (p=0.016) were significantly associated with the occurrence of AEs. Conclusion: The short-term vaccine reactions experienced in this cohort of IBD patients were mostly self-limiting, including local pain at the injection site, fatigue and fever. We found a good safety profile of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in our cohort.

N2  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health problem. Patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis are at a higher risk of infection and mortality than the general population. Worldwide, a vaccination campaign has been developed that has been shown to reduce severe infections and deaths in the general population. However, there are currently limited data on the clinical efficacy of vaccinations in the hemodialysis population. Methods: A national multicenter observational cohort was performed in Chile to evaluate the clinical efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in end-stage renal disease patients on chronic hemodialysis from February 2021 to August 2021. In addition, the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and CoronaVac (Sinovac) vaccines were evaluated. The efficacy of vaccination in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalizations, and deaths associated with COVID-19 was determined. Results: A total of 12,301 patients were evaluated; 10,615 (86.3%) received a complete vaccination (2 doses), 490 (4.0%) received incomplete vaccination, and 1196 (9.7%) were not vaccinated. During follow-up, 1362 (11.0%) patients developed COVID-19, and 150 died (case fatality rate: 11.0%). The efficacy of the complete vaccination in preventing infection was 18.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]:11.8–23.8%), and prevention of death was 66.0% (95% CI:60.6–70.7%). When comparing both vaccines, BNT162b2 and CoronaVac were effective in reducing infection and deaths associated with COVID-19. Nevertheless, the BNT162b2 vaccine had higher efficacy in preventing infection (42.6% vs. 15.0%) and deaths (90.4% vs. 64.8%) compared to CoronaVac. Conclusion: The results of our study suggest that vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in patients on chronic hemodialysis was effective in preventing infection and death associated with COVID-19.

N2  - Objectives This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of Covishield vaccine among residents of congregate residential facilities. Design A prospective cohort study in congregate residential facilities. Setting Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh, India, from December 2020 to July 2021. Participants Residents of all ages in seven facilities - three monasteries, two old age homes and two learning centres - were enrolled. Exposures First and second doses of Covishield vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main outcomes measures Primary outcome was development of COVID-19. Secondary outcome was unfavourable outcomes, defined as a composite of shortness of breath, hospitalisation or death. Vaccine effectiveness (%) was calculated as (1-HR)×100. Results There were 1114 residents (median age 31 years) participating in the study, 82% males. Twenty-eight per cent (n=308/1114) were unvaccinated, 50% (n=554/1114) had received one dose and 23% (n=252/1114) had received two doses of Covishield. The point prevalence of COVID-19 for the facilities ranged from 11% to 57%. Incidence rates (95% CI) of COVID-19 were 76 (63 to 90)/1000 person-months in the unvaccinated, 25 (18 to 35)/1000 person-months in recipients of one dose and 9 (4 to 19)/1000 person-months in recipients of two doses. The effectiveness of first and second doses of Covishield were 71% (adjusted HR (aHR) 0.29; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.46; p<0.001) and 80% (aHR 0.20; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.44; p<0.001), respectively, against SARS-CoV-2 infection and 86% (aHR 0.24; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.82; p=0.023) and 99% (aHR 0.01; 95% CI 0.002 to 0.10; p<0.001), respectively, against unfavourable outcome. The effectiveness was higher after 14 days of receiving the first and second doses, 93% and 98%, respectively. Risk of infection was higher in persons with chronic hepatitis B (aHR 1.78; p=0.034) and previous history of tuberculosis (aHR 1.62; p=0.047). Conclusion Covishield was effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and reducing disease severity in highly transmissible settings during the second wave of the pandemic driven by the Delta variant.

N2  - Novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused more than 2,38 million deaths and more than 108 million cases confirmed in one year of the pandemic are massive upheavals in social life and economy in the international world. An effective vaccine is needed to prevent further morbidity and mortality. This research aims to identify the challenge in implementing mass vaccination in Indonesia which is related to the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine. We retrieve sources from relevant and published articles in Google Scholar, Pubmed, DOAJ and Science Direct of articles up to January 2021. The keywords used for gathering information were listed below. Vaccine efficacy is defined as the proportional reduction of a disease case in a group of vaccinated participants compared with unvaccinated participants. The study of vaccine efficacy is a cohort study that is an important vaccine trial method in the field. It is conducted randomly on a large scale by using a control-placebo. During the trials, the country which used the vaccine needs to maintain and observe the vaccine epidemiology. A trial roadmap is expected to identify the condition of the area epidemiologically. Vaccine efficacy is essential to be observed before implementing the vaccine in society. However, intensive socialization about the advantage of vaccines is mainly needed to prevent irrelevant information in social media about mass vaccination.

N2  - Patients with chronic kidney disease on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have a very high risk of death in the course of COVID-19. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 and the fatality rate in HD patients. A retrospective registry-based cohort study was performed in all HD adult patients in the Pomeranian Voivodeship. Vaccinations were carried out from January to April 2021 with mRNA vaccines, either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 with two-dose schedule. In the first analysis (2nd pandemic wave), 1,160 unvaccinated patients were included (59.7% males, 25.7% diabetic). In the second analysis (4th pandemic wave), 1,131 (59.4% male, 30.7% diabetic) individuals were included, 1,042 (92.13%) were fully vaccinated. Three hundred and fifteen HD patients (27.2%) were COVID-19 positive during the 2nd wave, and 6.9% (78/1,131) during the 4th wave. Within the fully vaccinated patients of the 4th wave, 60 were COVID-19 positive, 5.8 vs. 20.2% of unvaccinated COVID-19 positive patients in 2nd wave, respectively. COVID-19 incidence rate ratio (IRR) was 0.21 (4th wave-vaccinated vs. 2nd wave-unvaccinated) indicating a 79% reduction. The IRR between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients of the 4th wave was 0.28 in favor of vaccinated patients with 72% reduction. In the 2nd wave, 93 patients died as a result of COVID-19 (fatality rate: 29.5%). The fatality rate of fully vaccinated patients during the 4th wave was 6.7% (p = 0.004), while the fatality rate in the 4th wave within unvaccinated patients accounted for 11.1%. Significant clinical effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination was demonstrated in a multicenter study in HD patients.

N2  - Purpose: The COVID pandemic has posed a significant challenge among kidney transplant recipients (KTR) due to their immunocompromised states. The effects of COVID vaccination on KTRs are uncertain. We sought to better understand the clinical course, management, and outcomes of KTRs who developed COVID infection during the pre-and post-COVID vaccine rollout periods. We also compared whether there was a difference in patient outcomes or management of COVID infection between the two groups. Methods: This was a single-center study of KTRs who were infected with COVID. Baseline demographics, clinical parameters, COVID vaccination status, management, and outcomes were obtained by manual chart abstraction of the electronic medical records. Results: We studied a total of 134 KTRs in the pre-vaccination era and 83 KTRs after vaccination rollout who had COVID infections. The mean age of the patients was 54 years in both groups, and there was a greater proportion of African American KTRs in the pre-vaccination rollout era (70% vs. 53%, P=.02). No statistically significant differences were found among sex, BMI, or induction agents. In the pre-vaccination era, KTRs were more likely to present with fever (71% vs. 51%, P<.001). No statistically significant differences were observed in the onset of COVID infection after transplant, ICU admission, the requirement of mechanical ventilation therapy, incidence of AKI (acute kidney injury), requirement of renal replacement therapy (RRT), or incidence of acute rejection. For COVID infection management, KTRs in the post-vaccination rollout era were more likely to be treated with dexamethasone (47% vs. 32%, P=.035) . No statistically significant difference was found in the proportion of patients who required reduction or discontinuation of immunosuppressive agents. In the pre-vaccination era, KTRs were more likely to recover from acute kidney injury (57% vs, 25%, P=.01). No statistically significant difference was found in mortality between groups, but the risk of death was almost twice a high in the post-vaccination rollout era (21% vs. 12%). Conclusions: In this single-center case-control study, COVID vaccination rollout did not seem to have an appreciable impact on the incidence of hospitalization, ICU admission, AKI, RRT requirement, or mortality. Mortality risk among KTRs in the post-vaccination rollout era was almost twice as high as it was in the pre-vaccination rollout era, although there was no statistically significant difference, which might be due to low statistical power. The lack of improved outcomes of KTRs in the postvaccination rollout remains unclear. A combination of suboptimal immunogenic response to vaccination and the Delta variant surge could be a possibility.

N2  - Background. Of the nine COVID-19 vaccines, the inactivated vaccine named CoronaVac, containing HB02 strain of SARS-CoV-2 created from Vero cells, created by the manufacturing company Sinovac was the first vaccine to arrive and be distributed in the Philippines, primarily in the private and government hospitals in Metro Manila. It is therefore important to determine the vaccine's effectiveness and safety among its recipients, including the frontline healthcare workers (HCWs). Methods. This was an observational cohort study which included HCWs from a tertiary hospital who have received one and/or two doses of CoronaVac from March 2021. The primary outcome of the study was to determine the clinical effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing risk of COVID-19 infection. The secondary outcome was the safety endpoint of the study vaccine. Results. Out of the 2954 CoronaVac vaccinees, a total of 368 HCWs have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. 146 (4.94%) recipients have been infected with COVID-19 after receiving their first dose, while 222 (7.51%) tested positive after the second dose. 179 recipients reported of adverse reactions following immunization, with majority of these HCWs experiencing minor symptoms. The relative risk for COVID-19 infection among those given was at 15.7%, indicating the clinical effectiveness of the said vaccine. Receiving CoronaVac vaccine will reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection by 84.3%. Table 3. Percentage of infected HCWs in SLMC-QC post-vaccination of CoronaVac Out of the 2954 CoronaVac vaccinees from SLMC, a total of 368 HCWs have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 after receiving either their first or second dose of CoronaVac vaccine from March to December 2021. 146 (4.94%) recipients have been infected with COVID-19 after receiving their first dose, while 222 (7.51%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after completing two doses of the inactivated vaccine (Table 3). Meanwhile, during the observation period after the 2nd dose of the vaccine, there were more reported cases of COVID-19. From a total of 222 (60.6%) COVID-19 confirmed cases after receiving their second dose of Sinovac, 33 were asymptomatic, while 176 recipients acquired mild infection and 12 participants had moderate COVID-19 infection. There was one case of severe COVID-19 and no cases of critical COVID-19 after completion of 2 doses among the HCWs (Figure 1). Based on this information, the researchers have computed for the relative risk (RR) for acquiring COVID-19 (Table 9). In the unvaccinated group, the risk for COVID-19 infection was reported at 79.5%, while the computed risk for COVID-19 among the treatment group, or those who received CoronaVac, was at 12.5%. Moreover, the relative risk for COVID-19 infection when given SINOVAC vaccine was at 15%, with relative risk reduction (RRR) of 84.3% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) 67% from baseline. Conclusion. CoronaVac vaccine is clinically effective in reducing the risk and severity of COVID-19 infection among HCWs in the study institution. Likewise, this inactivated vaccine can be safely given to individuals who are eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccine.

N2  - COVID-19 vaccines have achieved a significant reduction in mortality, yet objective es-timates are needed in specific settings. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination at a referral hospital in Lambayeque, Peru. We conducted a retrospective cohort study from February to September 2021. We included hospitalized patients with COVID-19, whose data were stored in NotiWeb, a patient data system of the Peruvian Ministry of Health. We applied a propensity score-weighting method according to baseline characteristics of patients, and estimated hazard ratios (HR) using Cox regression models. Of 1553 participants, the average age was 55 years (SD: 16.8), 907 (58%) were male, and 592 (38%) deceased at 28-day follow-up. Before hospital admis-sion, 74 (4.8%) had been immunized with at least one vaccine dose. Effectiveness against death in vaccinated patients was 50% at 90-day follow-up (weighted HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28–0.89). Our results support the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination against death and provide information after early immunization in Peru.

N2  - Introduction: The COVID-19 booster vaccination was started in nursing homes (NH) from November 2021, and the omicron variant of the virus emerged. Yet, the effect of the booster on the disease course of COVID-19 was currently unknown. Therefore, we investigated the symptoms and risk of death after a COVID-19 infection in boosted NH residents and compared this group to NH residents without a booster or COVID-19 and to previous COVID-19 waves. Methods: Population-based longitudinal cohort study with electronic health record data. Data on vaccination status, age, gender, type of care, comorbidities, and date of death were extracted between 1 January and May 18, 2022. Risk of death and symptomatology of COVID-19 were compared between NH residents with a booster (Booster +) and without a booster (Booster-/+). Moreover, we compared the Booster + group with a group of residents where COVID- 19 was ruled out despite a clinical suspicion of COVID-19 (COVID- 19-). Finally, we compared our current results with previous waves of COVID-19. Results: Boosted NH residents (n = 3.149) had a milder disease course and symptomatology compared to the Booster-/+ group (n = 1.228) and previous waves of COVID-19. Only having a cold was more frequent in the Booster + group. Risk of death was much lower in the Booster + group (6%) than in the Booster-/+ group (12%), COVID-19- group (13%, n = 1.295) and previous waves (22%-42%). Key conclusions: Despite the omicron variant having a milder disease course, our results indicate that boostering of NH residents was still effective; boostering was characterized with milder symptomatology and lower mortality.

N2  - Background: COVID-19 vaccines are effective in reducing the risks of Hospitalization and death, especially for people with comorbidities and impaired immunity. Systemic reactions such as fever, headache and myalgia are frequently reported after COVID-19 vaccination, especially adenoviral vector vaccines followed by mRNA and inactivated vaccines. Thalassemia disease is the most common monogenic disease worldwide. Among patients with thalassemia diseases, high fever or systemic reactogenicity after vaccination may trigger hemolysis, resulting in a sudden decrease in hemoglobin levels. Aims: To determine whether COVID-19 vaccination significantly reduces hemoglobin (Hb) levels in Thalassemia patients by comparing pre- and post-vaccinated Hb levels after individual vaccination. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed using medical records of thalassemia disease patients, who were followed up at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (KCMH) from January 2021 to January 2022. Four Hb values; the most recent pre-vaccinated Hb levels (Hb1) and post-vaccinated Hb levels (Hb2) after the first COVID-19 vaccination and the most recent pre-vaccinated Hb levels (Hb3) and post-vaccinated Hb levels (Hb4) after the second COVID-19 vaccination of individual patients were retrieved. Comparison between pre- and postvaccinated Hb levels of each vaccination was computed using paired t-test. Results: Among 220 transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients who were regularly followed up at Hematology Department, KCMH, 199 had COVID-19 vaccination records. There were 184 fully vaccinated patients. The first dose vaccinations were being comprised of 115 viral vector vaccines (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19), 42 inactivated vaccines (BBIBP-CorV and CoronaVac)) and 32 mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273). The proportions of the second vaccinations were almost similar. Only 9 patients first vaccinated with inactivated vaccines were administered viral vector vaccines in the second vaccination. Of 120 patients with available Hb data after the first vaccination, the mean difference of Hb levels after first vaccination was 0.03±0.9 g/dL (p = 0.685). The median interval between obtained Hb1 and the first vaccination was 50.6 (IQR: 22-70) days, and between obtained Hb2 and the first vaccination was 28.5 (IQR: 14-38) days. Of 71 patients with available Hb data after the second vaccination, the mean difference of Hb levels after the second vaccination was 0.13±1.0 g/dL (p = 0.292). The median interval between obtained Hb3 and the second vaccination was 27.6 (IQR: 14-34) days, and between obtained Hb4 and the second vaccination was 38.2 (IQR: 18-52) days. There were 14 patients (11.7%) whose Hb levels were decreased over 1 g/dL after the first vaccination, while there were 7 patients (9.9%) whose Hb levels were decreased over 1 g/dL after the second vaccine. Most of these patients were administered viral vector vaccines. (Figure Presented ) Summary/Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccines generally do not significantly affect Hb levels in thalassemia disease patients. Approximately 10% of patients had a clinically significant reduction in Hb levels after vaccination, especially those administered viral vector vaccines probably due to prevalent systemic reactogenicity. Although the benefit of COVID-19 vaccine protection is still outweighed this risk, thalassemia patients should be educated about this possible reaction and to observe symptoms and signs of hemolysis after COVID-19 vaccination.

N2  - Background: Vaccine hesitancy causes serious difficulties in vaccination campaigns in many countries. The study of the population’s attitude toward vaccination and detection of the predictive important individual psychological and social factors defining the vaccination necessity perception will allow elaborating promoting vaccination adherence measures. Objectives: The aim of this research was to study COVID-19 threat appraisal, fear of COVID-19, trust in COVID-19 information sources, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, and the relationship of sociodemographic variables to COVID-19 preventive behavior. Methods: We carried out a cohort cross-sectional study of the population’s attitude toward vaccination against the novel COVID-19 coronavirus infection, using a specially designed questionnaire for an online survey. Totally, there were 4,977 respondents, ranging in age from 18 to 81 years. Statistical assessment was carried out using the SPSS-11 program. Results: There were different attitudes toward vaccination. Among respondents, 34.2% considered vaccination to be useful, 31.1% doubted its effectiveness, and 9.9% considered vaccination unnecessary. The survey indicated that 7.4% of respondents were indifferent to the vaccine, while 12.2% deemed it to be dangerous. Nearly one-third (32.3%) of respondents indicated that they did not plan to be vaccinated, while another third (34.0%) would postpone their decision until more comprehensive data on the results and effectiveness of vaccination were available. Only 11.6% of the respondents were vaccinated at the time of the study. Young people were less focused on vaccination compared to middle-aged and elderly people. Receiving information concerning COVID-19 vaccination from healthcare workers and scientific experts was associated with greater vaccination acceptance. Conclusion: The study results showed that vaccination attitudes interacted with individuals’ mental health and various sociodemographic factors. Insofar as reports of physicians and experts are essential for shaping attitudes to vaccination, the study results inform the selection of target groups in need of particular psychosocial interventions to overcome their vaccine hesitancy.

N2  - Background: COVID-19 vaccination was recommended for adolescents in Norway since August 2021. In this population-based cohort study, we estimated the BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness against any PCR-confirmed (symptomatic or not) SARS-CoV-2 infections caused by the Delta and Omicron variant among adolescents (12-17-years-old) in Norway from August 2021 to January 2022. Methods: Using Cox proportional hazard models, we estimated the BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness against any Delta and Omicron infections. Vaccine status was included as a time-varying covariate and models were adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, county of residence, country of birth, and living conditions. Data were obtained from the National Preparedness registry for COVID-19, which contains individual-level data from national health and administrative registries. Findings: Vaccine effectiveness against Delta infection peaked at 68% (95%CI: 64–71%) and 62% (95%CI: 57–66%) in days 21-48 after the first dose among 12–15-year-olds and 16–17-year-olds respectively. Among 16–17-year-olds that received two doses, vaccine effectiveness peaked at 93% (95%CI: 90–95%) in days 35-62 and declined to 84% (95%CI: 76–89%) in 63 days or more after the second dose. For both age-groups, we found no protection against Omicron infection after receiving one dose. Among 16–17-year-olds, vaccine effectiveness against Omicron infection peaked at 53% (95%CI: 43–62%) in 7-34 days after the second dose and decreased to 23% (95%CI: 3–40%) in 63 days or more after vaccination. Vaccine effectiveness decreased with time since vaccination for both variants, but waning was observed to occur faster for Omicron. Interpretation: Our results suggest reduced protection from BNT162b2 vaccination against any SARS-CoV-2 infection caused by the Omicron variant compared to the Delta. In addition, waning immunity was observed to occur faster for Omicron. The impact of vaccination among adolescents on reducing infection and thus transmission is limited during omicron dominance.

N2  - Background: The use of COVID-19 vaccines has been prioritised to protect the most vulnerable—notably, older people. Because of fluctuations in vaccine availability, strategies such as delayed second dose and heterologous prime-boost have been used. However, the effectiveness of these strategies in frail, older people are unknown. We aimed to assess the antigenicity of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines in frail, older people in a real-world setting, with a rationed interval dosing of 16 weeks between the prime and boost doses. Methods: This prospective observational cohort study was done across 12 long-term care facilities of the Montréal Centre-Sud – Integrated University Health and Social Services Centre in Montréal, Québec, Canada. Under a rationing strategy mandated by the provincial government, adults aged 65 years and older residing in long-term care facilities in Québec, Canada, with or without previously documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, were administered homologous or heterologous mRNA vaccines, with an extended 16-week interval between doses. All older residents in participating long-term care facilities who received two vaccine doses were eligible for inclusion in this study. Participants were enrolled from Dec 31, 2020, to Feb 16, 2021, and data were collected up to June 9, 2021. Clinical data and blood samples were serially collected from participants at the following timepoints: at baseline, before the first dose; 4 weeks after the first dose; 6–10 weeks after the first dose; 16 weeks after the first dose, up to 2 days before administration of the second dose; and 4 weeks after the second dose. Sera were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies (to the trimeric spike protein, the receptor-binding domain [RBD] of the spike protein, and the nucleocapsid protein) by automated chemiluminescent ELISA. Two cohorts were used in this study: a discovery cohort, for which blood samples were collected before administration of the first vaccine dose and longitudinally thereafter; and a confirmatory cohort, for which blood samples were only collected from 4 weeks after the prime dose. Analyses were done in the discovery cohort, with validation in the confirmatory cohort, when applicable. Findings: The total study sample consisted of 185 participants. 65 participants received two doses of mRNA-1273 (Spikevax; Moderna), 36 received two doses of BNT162b2 (Comirnaty; Pfizer–BioNTech), and 84 received mRNA-1273 followed by BNT162b2. In the discovery cohort, after a significant increase in anti-RBD and anti-spike IgG concentrations 4 weeks after the prime dose (from 4·86 log binding antibody units [BAU]/mL to 8·53 log BAU/mL for anti-RBD IgG and from 5·21 log BAU/mL to 8·05 log BAU/mL for anti-spike IgG), there was a significant decline in anti-RBD and anti-spike IgG concentrations until the boost dose (7·10 log BAU/mL for anti-RBD IgG and 7·60 log BAU/mL for anti-spike IgG), followed by an increase 4 weeks later for both vaccines (9·58 log BAU/mL for anti-RBD IgG and 9·23 log BAU/mL for anti-spike IgG). SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals showed lower antibody responses than previously infected individuals at all timepoints tested up to 16 weeks after the prime dose, but achieved similar antibody responses to previously infected participants by 4 weeks after the second dose. Individuals primed with the BNT162b2 vaccine showed a larger decrease in mean anti-RBD and anti-spike IgG concentrations with a 16-week interval between doses (from 8·12 log BAU/mL to 4·25 log BAU/mL for anti-RBD IgG responses and from 8·18 log BAU/mL to 6·66 log BAU/mL for anti-spike IgG responses) than did those who received the mRNA-1273 vaccine (two doses of mRNA-1273: from 8·06 log BAU/mL to 7·49 log BAU/mL for anti-RBD IgG responses and from 6·82 log BAU/mL to 7·56 log BAU/mL for anti-spike IgG responses; mRNA-1273 followed by BNT162b2: from 8·83 log BAU/mL to 7·95 log BAU/mL for anti-RBD IgG responses and from 8·50 log BAU/mL to 7·97 log BAU/mL for anti-spike IgG responses). No differences in antibody responses 4 weeks after the second dose were noted between the two vaccines, in either homologous or heterologous combinations. Interpretation: Interim results of this ongoing longitudinal study show that among frail, older people, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and the type of mRNA vaccine influenced antibody responses when used with a 16-week interval between doses. In these cohorts of frail, older individuals with a similar age and comorbidity distribution, we found that serological responses were similar and clinically equivalent between the discovery and confirmatory cohorts. Homologous and heterologous use of mRNA vaccines was not associated with significant differences in antibody responses 4 weeks following the second dose, supporting their interchangeability.

N2  - Background: In late 2021, the pandemic wave was dominated by the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant in Hungary. Booster vaccines were offered starting from August 2021. Methods: The nationwide HUN-VE 3 study examined the effectiveness and durability of primary immunization and single booster vaccinations on SARS-CoV-2-related infection, hospitalization and mortality during the Delta wave. Results: The study population included 8,087,988 individuals aged 18–100 years at the beginning of the pandemic. During the Delta wave, after adjusting for age, sex, calendar day, and chronic diseases, vaccine effectiveness (VE) of primary vaccination against registered SARS-CoV-2 infection was between 11% to 77% and 18% to 79% 14–120 days after primary immunization in the 16–64 and 65–100 years age cohort respectively, while it decreased to close to zero in the younger age group and around 40% or somewhat less in the elderly after 6 months for almost all vaccine types. In the population aged 65–100 years, we found high, 88.1%–92.5% adjusted effectiveness against Covid-19 infection after the Pfizer-BioNTech, and 92.2%–95.6% after the Moderna booster dose, while Sinopharm and Janssen booster doses provided 26.5%–75.3% and 72.9%–100.0% adjusted VE, respectively. Adjusted VE against Covid-19 related hospitalization was high within 14–120 days for Pfizer-BioNTech: 76.6%, Moderna: 83.8%, Sputnik-V: 78.3%, AstraZeneca: 73.8%, while modest for Sinopharm: 45.7% and Janssen: 26.4%. The waning of protection against Covid-19 related hospitalization was modest and booster vaccination with mRNA vaccines or the Janssen vaccine increased adjusted VE up to almost 100%, while the Sinopharm booster dose proved to be less effective. VE against Covid-19 related death after primary immunization was high or moderate: for Pfizer-BioNTech: 81.5%, Moderna: 93.2%, Sputnik-V: 100.0%, AstraZeneca: 84.8%, Sinopharm: 58.6%, Janssen: 53.3%). VE against this outcome also showed moderate decline over time, while booster vaccines restored effectiveness up to almost 100%, except for the Sinopharm booster. Conclusions: The HUN-VE 3 study demonstrated waning VE with all vaccine types for all examined outcomes during the Delta wave and confirmed the outstanding benefit of booster vaccination with the mRNA or Janssen vaccines. This is the first study to provide comparable effectiveness results for six different booster types during the Delta pandemic wave.

N2  - Background: While booster vaccinations clearly reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 and death, the impact of boosters on SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been fully characterized: doing so requires understanding their impact on asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic infections that often go unreported but nevertheless play an important role in spreading SARS-CoV-2. We sought to estimate the impact of COVID-19 booster doses on SARS-CoV-2 infection in a vaccinated population of young adults during an Omicron BA.1-predominant period. Methods and Findings: We implemented a cohort study of young adults in a college environment (Cornell University’s Ithaca campus) from a period when Omicron BA.1 was the predominant SARSCoV-2 variant on campus (December 5 to December 31, 2021). Participants included 15,800 university students who completed an initial vaccination series with a vaccine approved by the World Health Organization for emergency use, were enrolled in mandatory at-least-weekly surveillance PCR testing, and had no positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test within 90 days before the start of the study period. Robust multivariable Poisson regression with the main outcome of a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test was performed to compare those who completed their initial vaccination series and a booster dose to those without a booster dose. 1,926 unique SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified in the study population. Controlling for sex, student group membership, date of completion of initial vaccination series, initial vaccine type, and temporal effect during the study period, our analysis estimates that receiving a booster dose further reduces the rate of having a PCR-detected SARS-CoV-2 infection relative to an initial vaccination series by 56% (95% confidence interval [42%, 67%], P <0.001). While most individuals had recent booster administration before or during the study period (a limitation of our study), this result is robust to the assumed delay over which a booster dose becomes effective (varied from 1 day to 14 days). The mandatory active surveillance approach used in this study, under which 86% of the person-days in the study occurred, reduces the likelihood of outcome mis-classification. Key limitations of our methodology are that we did not have an a priori protocol or statistical analysis plan because the analysis was initially done for institutional research purposes, and some analysis choices were made after observing the data. Conclusions: We observed that boosters are effective, relative to completion of initial vaccination series, in further reducing the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections in a college student population during a period when Omicron BA.1 was predominant; booster vaccinations for this age group may play an important role in reducing incidence of COVID-19.

N2  - Introduction: Children with pediatric inflammatory rheumatic diseases (PRD) have an increased infection risk. Vaccinations are effective to avoid vaccine-preventable diseases. This study aimed to assess the vaccination completeness in Swiss PRD patients stratified by immunosuppressive treatment (IST). Materials and methods: This multicenter observational cohort study of PRD patients was performed in Basel, Geneva, Lucerne, Lausanne, and Zurich in PRD patients aged < 18 years included in the Juvenile Inflammatory Rheumatism Cohort. Completeness was assessed for i) the overall vaccination status (Swiss national immunization program (NIP) and specific additional PRD-recommended vaccinations), ii) for all and each vaccination of the NIP at PRD diagnosis and reference date (RefD) and iii) all and each specific additional PRD-recommended vaccination at RefD. Completeness was assessed over the disease course and stratified by IST. Results: Of 616 eligible patients, 234 children were analyzed. Of these, 147 (63%) were girls. Median age at PRD diagnosis was 6.5 years (IQR 2.9–10.3) and 10.9 years at RefD (6.9–14.3). The median follow-up since PRD diagnosis was 3 years (1.1–5.5). 120/234 children received IST. At RefD, overall vaccination completeness was 3.8% (9/234 children), completeness for the NIP vaccinations was 70.1% (164/234 children; IST 65%, no IST: 75.4%) and for all specific additional PRD-recommended vaccinations was 3.8% (9/234 children; IST 2.5%; no IST 5.3%). Vaccination completeness against pneumococcal disease, hepatitis B virus, and human papilloma virus (HPV) was 50.4, 20, 37.9%, respectively. In 25/35 children with negative varicella zoster virus history vaccination status was complete (IST: 94.4%, no IST: 47%). Annual non-live influenza vaccination was complete in 24.2% of children during IST; adherence decreased over the disease course. Discussion: This study identified a low overall vaccination completeness in children with PRD. Particularly, the completeness of specific additional PRD-recommended vaccinations was low. If not performed early after PRD diagnosis, vaccination status remained frequently incomplete. Close collaboration between pediatrician and rheumatologist to improve vaccination completeness is essential. Exchange of vaccination records, standardized assessment of specific PRD-recommended vaccinations and those of the NIP, and annual reminder for influenza vaccination are crucial to improve vaccination completeness in this vulnerable pediatric population.

N2  - Background/Case Studies: SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are available under Emergency Use Authorization. Persons who have previously recovered from natural COVID-19 infection may have an increase in antibody levels after vaccination. We evaluated changes in antibody levels in COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors after vaccination. Study Design/Methods: We identified CCP donors who had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing performed within 90 days prior to vaccine, and tested again within 90 days after the first dose of the vaccine. Anti-SARSCoV- 2 testing was performed using the Ortho VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total and IgG semi-quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassays (ChLIA). Neutralizing antibody (nAB) titers were also performed using an in-house fluorescence reduction neutralization assay (FRNA). Results/Findings: 21 CCP donors received least 1 dose of the Moderna (n=11) or Pfizer (n=10) vaccine; mean age 54.71 ± 14.28 years; F:M=2:1, 76% Caucasian. Prevaccine samples were collected 19.90 ± 17.83 days (mean + standard deviation) prior to the first dose of the vaccine. Post-vaccination samples were collected 35.33 ± 18.18 days after the first dose of the vaccine. After vaccination, 100% of donors showed a significant increase in total anti-SARSCoV- 2 (mean fold increase 9.2 ± 10.7); 90.4% (19/21) donors demonstrated an increase in IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 (mean fold increase 3.2 ± 2.4). For donors who received 2 vaccine doses, mean increases total and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 were comparable to the overall mean. Neutralizing antibody titers were available for 10 donors; 9/10 demonstrated 16 to 32-fold increases in the neutralizing antibody titer (FRNA50). In 12/21 (57 %) donors, the post-vaccine IgG was ≥ 9.5, but the sample was drawn > 180 days after resolution of COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusions: CCP donors had significant increases in total and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after vaccination. 12/21 (57 %) of convalescent donors in this cohort demonstrated IgG S/Co > 9.5 after vaccination, but would not be eligible to donate CCP under the current FDA guidance, since they were > 180 days post-recovery from COVID-19. Recovered COVID-19 subjects who are vaccinated may make ideal candidates for CCP donation, but may be limited by the current restriction on CCP donation > 6 months after recovery.

N2  - Objectives With most of the Norwegian population vaccinated against COVID-19, an increasing number and proportion of COVID-19 related hospitalisations are occurring among vaccinated patients. We estimated the length of stay (LoS) in hospital and an intensive care unit (ICU), and risk of admission to ICU and in-hospital death among COVID-19 patients ≥18 years who had been fully vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine, compared to unvaccinated patients. Methods Using national registry data, we conducted a cohort study on SARS-CoV-2 positive patients hospitalised in Norway between 1 February and 30 November 2021, with COVID-19 as the main cause of hospitalisation. We ran Cox proportional hazards models to analyse differences in our outcomes. Explanatory variables included vaccination status, age, sex, county of residence, regional health authority, date of admission, country of birth, virus variant and underlying risk factors. Results We included 3,203 patients, of whom 716 (22%) were fully vaccinated (at least two doses or one dose and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection). Fully vaccinated patients had a shorter overall LoS in hospital (aHR for discharge: 1.61, 95%CI: 1.24–2.08), shorter LoS without ICU (aHR: 1.27, 95%CI: 1.07–1.52), and lower risk of ICU admission (aHR: 0.50, 95%CI: 0.37–0.69) compared to unvaccinated patients. We observed no difference in the LoS in ICU, nor risk of in-hospital death between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Conclusions Fully vaccinated patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in Norway have a shorter LoS and lower risk of ICU admission than unvaccinated patients. These findings can support patient management and ongoing capacity planning in hospitals.

N2  - Background: We estimated COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes among individuals with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases in Ontario, Canada. Methods: In this population-based analysis, we used a test-negative design across four immune-mediated inflammatory disease population-based cohorts, comprising individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease. We identified all SARS-CoV-2 tests done in these populations between March 1 and Nov 22, 2021 (a period in which there was rapid uptake of vaccines, and the alpha [B.1.1.7] and delta [B.1.617.2] SARS-CoV-2 variants were predominantly circulating in Canada) and separately assessed outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes (hospitalisation due to COVID-19 and death due to COVID-19) for each disease group. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the effectiveness of one, two, and three doses of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 [Pfizer–BioNTech], or mRNA-1273 [Moderna]) among individuals at the time of SARS-CoV-2 testing. Findings: Between March 1 and Nov 22, 2021, we identified 2127 (5·9%) test-positive cases among 36 145 individuals (26 476 [73·2%] were female and 9669 [26·8%] were male) with rheumatoid arthritis tested, 476 (6·1%) test-positive cases among 7863 individuals (4130 [52·5%] were female and 3733 [47·5%] were male) with ankylosing spondylitis tested, 3089 (6·5%) test-positive cases among 47 199 individuals (26 062 [55·2%] were female and 21 137 [44·8%] were male) with psoriasis tested, and 1702 (5·4%) test-positive cases among 31 311 individuals (17 716 [56·6%] were female and 13 595 [43·4%] were male) with inflammatory bowel disease tested. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness of two doses against infection was 83% (95% CI 80–86) in those with rheumatoid arthritis, 89% (83–93) among those with ankylosing spondylitis, 84% (81–86) among those with psoriasis, and 79% (74–82) among those with inflammatory bowel disease. After two vaccine doses, effectiveness against infection generally peaked 31–60 days after vaccination and waned gradually with each additional month. Vaccine effectiveness against severe outcomes after two doses was 92% (95% CI 88–95) in those with rheumatoid arthritis, 97% (83–99) among those with ankylosing spondylitis, 92% (86–95) among those with psoriasis, and 94% (88–97) among those with inflammatory bowel disease. Vaccine effectiveness after a third dose against infection was similar to or higher than after the second dose (ranging from 76% [47–89] to 96% [72–99]), although due to a paucity of events, estimates could not be calculated for some subgroups for severe outcomes. Interpretation: Two vaccine doses were found to be highly effective against both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease during the study period. Research is needed to determine the durability of effectiveness of three doses over time, particularly against emerging variants. Funding: Public Health Agency of Canada

N2  - Background The influence of pre-existing humoral immunity, inter-individual demographic factors, and vaccine-associated reactogenicity on immunogenicity following COVID vaccination remains poorly understood. Methods Ten-fold cross-validated least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and linear mixed effects models were used to evaluate symptoms experienced during natural infection and following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination along with demographics as predictors for antibody (AB) responses in COVID+ participants in a longitudinal cohort study. Results In previously infected individuals, AB were more durable and robust following vaccination when compared to natural infection alone. Higher AB were associated with experiencing dyspnea during natural infection, as was the total number of symptoms reported during the COVID-19 disease course. Both local and systemic symptoms following 1st and 2nd dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines were predictive of higher AB after vaccination, as were the demographic factors of age and Hispanic ethnicity. Lastly, there was a significant temporal relationship between AB and days since infection or vaccination. Conclusion Vaccination in COVID+ individuals ensures a more robust immune response. Experiencing systemic and local symptoms post-vaccine is suggestive of higher AB, which may confer greater protection. Age and Hispanic ethnicity are predictive of higher AB.

N2  - Background: Real-world utilization of COVID-19 vaccines may differ from clinical trials with respect to dosing and spacing. To study the safety and effectiveness of multi-dose COVID-19 vaccine series, investigators must consider several methodological challenges, including attributing risk or effectiveness to dose schedules, immortal-time bias, and overlapping risk windows following vaccinations. This Vaccine Special Interest Group-endorsed symposium will highlight methods to address these challenges to support regulatory decisionmaking. Objectives: To illustrate challenges and propose methodologic approaches for validly assessing the real-world safety and effectiveness of multi-dose COVID-19 vaccine series in study designs of cohort, case-control, self-controlled case series (SCCS), and rapid cycle analyses. Description: The symposium will include a 5-min overview on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) national active surveillance systems for COVID-19 vaccines, i.e., Biologics Effectiveness and SafeTy (BEST) Initiative (Dr. Wong), four 15-min presentations followed by 5-min Q&A each, and a 20-min panel discussion. (1) Methods to assess different dosing of COVID-19 vaccines. Dr. García de Albéniz will discuss causal inference-based methodological approaches to study the effectiveness and safety of different dosing (e.g. half dose, 1 dose, and 2 doses) of COVID-19 vaccines for cohort and casecontrol studies. (2) Methods to study variable spacing of COVID-19 doses. Dr. Butler will demonstrate a novel application of an inverse probability censoring-weighted estimation approach to estimate the effects of different multi-dose vaccine series, using an example from a cohort study on rotavirus vaccine schedules. The applicability of this approach to study COVID-19 vaccines and several challenges will be discussed. (3) Heterogeneous dosing and spacing of COVID-19 vaccinations in SCCS. Dr. Whitaker will discuss methodological considerations for SCCS studies to evaluate the transient risk of adverse events following multi-dose COVID-19 vaccines, focusing on the previous extensions to SCCS to examine death or adverse events that may contraindicate vaccination. (4) Rapid safety signal detection of multi-dose COVID-19 vaccine series. Dr. Suchard will provide an overview of methods for rapid signal detection performance (e.g., historical and contemporaneous comparators) with 1-dose versus 2-dose vaccines and compare methods performance between 1-dose vaccines (e.g., seasonal flu in adults) versus 2-dose vaccines (e.g., recombinant zoster) as examples.

N2  - Background: Several countries now have mandatory SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for healthcare workers (HCWs) or the general population. HCWs’ views on this are largely unknown. Using data from the nationwide UK-REACH study we aimed to understand UK HCW's views on improving SARS-CoV-2 vaccination coverage, including mandatory vaccination. Methods: Between 21st April and 26th June 2021, we administered an online questionnaire via email to 17 891 UK HCWs recruited as part of a longitudinal cohort from across the UK who had previously responded to a baseline questionnaire (primarily recruited through email) as part of the United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes in Healthcare workers (UK-REACH) nationwide prospective cohort study. We categorised responses to a free-text question “What should society do if people do not get vaccinated against COVID-19?” using qualitative content analysis. We collapsed categories into a binary variable: favours mandatory vaccination or not, using logistic regression to calculate its demographic predictors, and its occupational, health, and attitudinal predictors adjusted for demographics. Findings: Of 5633 questionnaire respondents, 3235 answered the free text question. Median age of free text responders was 47 years (IQR 36–56) and 2705 (74.3%) were female. 18% (n = 578) favoured mandatory vaccination (201 [6%] participants for HCWs and others working with vulnerable populations; 377 [12%] for the general population), but the most frequent suggestion was education (32%, n = 1047). Older HCWs (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.44–2.34 [≥55 years vs 16 years to <40 years]), HCWs vaccinated against influenza (OR 1.49; 95% CI 1.11–2.01 [2 vaccines vs none]), and with more positive vaccination attitudes generally (OR 1.10; 95% CI 1.06–1.15) were more likely to favour mandatory vaccination, whereas female HCWs (OR= 0.79, 95% CI 0.63–0.96, vs male HCWs) and Black HCWs (OR=0.46, 95% CI 0.25–0.85, vs white HCWs) were less likely to. Interpretation: Only one in six of the HCWs in this large, diverse, UK-wide sample favoured mandatory vaccination. Building trust, educating, and supporting HCWs who are hesitant about vaccination may be more acceptable, effective, and equitable. Funding: MRC-UK Research and Innovation grant (MR/V027549/1) and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) via the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). Core funding was also provided by NIHR Biomedical Research Centres.

N2  - COVID-19 vaccination protects against the potentially serious consequences of SARS-CoV2 infection, but some people have been hesitant to receive the vaccine because of reports that it could affect menstrual bleeding. To determine whether this occurs, we prospectively recruited a cohort of 79 individuals, each of whom recorded details of at least three consecutive menstrual cycles, during which time they each received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. We find that either dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is associated with a delay to the subsequent period in spontaneously cycling participants (2.3 days after dose 1; 1.3 days after dose 2) but this change rapidly reverses. No change to timing was detected in those on hormonal contraception. We detected no change in menstrual flow associated with either dose of the vaccine, in either spontaneously cycling participants or those on hormonal contraception. We detected no association between menstrual changes and other commonly-reported side effects of vaccination, such as sore arm, fever and fatigue.

N2  - Background: Data is lacking about SARS-CoV-2 vaccination effectiveness in patients with cancer, particularly those on systemic therapy. This retrospective cohort study in the US national Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system reports the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in cancer patients on and off active therapy during the first 140 days following administration. Methods: This is a multicenter study of SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinated and unvaccinated Veterans vaccinated during the period from 12/15/2020 to 5/4/2021. Veterans with solid or hematologic malignancy who received systemic cancer-directed therapy at the VA at least one time between 8/15/2010 to 5/4/2021 were included. Vaccinated patients were exactly matched 1:1 to an unvaccinated control on race, VA facility, rurality of home address, cancer type, and treatment timing and modality with minimum distance matching on age. The primary exposure was receipt of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination effectiveness was defined as 1 minus the risk ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection for vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated controls. Results: 184,485 patients met eligibility criteria and 113,796 were vaccinated during the study period. Of these, 29,152 vaccinated patients were matched 1:1 to 29,152 unvaccinated or not yet vaccinated controls. As of a median 47 days of follow-up, overall vaccine effectiveness in the matched cohort was 58% (95% CI, 39 to 72%) starting 14 days after the second dose. Patients on chemotherapy within three months prior to first vaccination dose exhibited a 14-day post-second dose effectiveness of 57% (95% CI -23 to 90%), versus 76% (95% CI 50 to 91%) for those on endocrine therapy and 85% (95% CI 29 to 100%) for those off systemic therapy for at least six months prior. Conclusions: Vaccination is an effective strategy for preventing COVID-19 in cancer patients. However, effectiveness may be reduced in patients actively receiving immunosuppressive systemic therapy. Future study is needed to determine if these patients would benefit from post-vaccination serologies and/or a booster vaccination following completion of therapy.

N2  - Background People with SLE (and their doctors) are concerned about the risk of COVID-19 infection, yet some patients still harbor concerns regarding vaccination. The first mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were not studied in this population. 1, 2 To address this knowledge gap, we evaluated the safety and side effects of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in people with SLE. Methods At a Canadian tertiary care centre, we studied SLE cohort patients who were followed with standardized annual assessments. From January 2021 to May 2022, 345 SLE patients consecutively seen for their annual research visit reported information on SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations. We performed descriptive data analysis on the type of vaccination received, side effects, ER visits, and hospitalizations. Result The patients were mostly female (n=306, 88.7%) and Caucasian (n=209, 60.6%) and the average SLE duration was 19.7 years (SD 11.9). Most patients (n=298, 86.4%) had received at least one SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and 248 (71.9%) has received at least 2 doses. Specifically, 50 (14.5%) had received one dose, 150 (43.5%) had received 2 doses and 98 (28.4%) had received at least 3. Most (n=181, 60.7%) of initial doses were Pfizer, followed by Moderna (n=54, 18.1%), AstraZeneca (n=12, 4.0%) and Johnson & Johnson (n=1, 0.3%). (The remaining (n=50, 16.8%) were unknown type.) About two-thirds (n=159, 63.3%) of the second doses were Pfizer, and 49 (19.5%) were Moderna. Among those receiving at least 1 vaccination dose, 34 of 128 patients who responded to the question reported symptoms post-vaccine (26.6%). The most common symptoms were fever and injection-related arm pain; both were reported at equal frequency (n=9, 7.0%). Other symptoms were fatigue and headache (n=6, 4.6% for both). There were 3 cases of myalgia and 2 cases of arthralgia. One patient reported hypertension after the first dose of vaccine which required a short 24h ER visit. The remaining did not specify their symptoms. No patients reported disease flare in the post vaccination period. Amongst those who provided information about SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=243), 19.3% reported testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Only one patient required hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection and was vaccine naïve at the time. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine side effects in this SLE population were reported in about a quarter of subjects but symptoms were mild, similar to reports in the general population. We did not detect any side effects requiring hospitalization. Since, in our cohort, the one subject requiring hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection was vaccine-naïve, a benefit for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in SLE seems evident.

N2  - Background/Purpose: SLE patients are an especially vulnerable population in the face of the COVID pandemic due to their dysregulated endogenous immune system, further downregulated by their disease-controlling immunosuppressant medication. The currently available mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were not studied in this population, given that immunosuppression was an exclusion criterion in their phase 3 clinical trials evaluating safety and efficacy (1, 2). We evaluated the selfreported effects of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in SLE patients, as well as infection. Methods: We studied SLE cohort patients who were followed with standardized annual assessments at a Canadian tertiary care centre. From January 2021 to May 2022, 345 SLE patients consecutively seen for their annual research visit reported information on SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations. We performed descriptive data analysis on the type of vaccination received, side effects as well as ER visits and hospitalizations (up to the time of their last assessment). Results: The patients were mostly female (n=306, 88.7%) and Caucasian (n=209, 60.6 %) and the average SLE duration was 19.7 years (SD 11.9). 298 patients (86.4%) had received at least one SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and 248 (71.9%) has received at least 2 doses. Specifically, 50 (14.5%) had received one dose, 150 (43.5%) had received 2 doses and 98 (28.4%) had received at least 3. Most (n=181, 60.7%) of initial doses were Pfizer, followed by Moderna (n=54, 18.1%), AstraZeneca (n=12, 4.0%) and Johnson & Johnson (n=1, 0.3%). The remaining (n=50, 16.8%) were unknown. 159 (63.3%) of the second doses were Pfizer, and 49 (19.5%) were Moderna. Among those who have received at least 1 vaccination dose, 34 of 128 patients who responded to the question reported symptoms post-vaccine (26.6%). The most common symptoms were fever and injection-related arm pain; both were reported at equal frequency (n=9, 7.0%). This is followed by fatigue and headache (n=6, 4.6% for both). There were 3 cases of myalgia and 2 cases of arthralgia. One patient reported hypertension after the first dose of vaccine, which required an ER visit. The remaining did not specify their symptoms. No patients reported disease flare in the post-vaccination period. Amongst those who provided information about SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=243, 70.4%), 19.3% reported testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, and the remaining (80.7%) never tested positive for COVID. Only one patient required hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection and was vaccine naïve at the time. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine side effects in this SLE population occurred in about a quarter, but most were mild, similar to the general population. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine did not induce any side effects requiring hospitalization. Since, in our cohort, the one patient requiring hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection was vaccine naïve, a benefit for SARSCoV-2 vaccination in SLE seems evident.

N2  - Background: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues and new variants such as Omicron emerge, we aimed to re-evaluate vaccine effectiveness as well as impacts of rigorously implemented infection control, public health and occupational health measures in protecting healthcare workers (HCWs). Methods: Following a cohort of 21,242 HCWs in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, for 20 months since the pandemic started, we used Cox regression and test-negative-design to examine differences in SARS-COV-2 infection rates compared to community counterparts, and within the HCW workforce, assessing the role of occupation, testing accessibility, vaccination rates, and vaccine effectiveness over time. Results: Nurses, allied health professionals and medical staff in this jurisdiction had a significantly lower rate of infection compared to their age-group community counterparts, at 47.4, 41.8, and 55.3% reduction respectively; controlling for vaccine-attributable reductions, the protective impact was still substantial, at 33.4, 28.0, and 36.5% respectively. Licensed practical nurses and care aides had the highest risk of infection among HCWs, more than double that of medical staff. However, even considering differences in vaccination rates, no increase in SARSCoV-2 infection was found compared to community rates, with combined protective measures beyond vaccination associated with a 17.7% reduced SARS-COV-2 rate in the VCH workforce overall. There was also no evidence of waning immunity within at least 200 days after second dose. Conclusion: Rigorously implemented occupational health, public health and infection control measures results in a well-protected healthcare workforce with infection rates at or below rates in community counterparts. Greater accessibility of vaccination worldwide is essential; however, as implementing measures to protect this workforce globally also requires considerable health system strengthening in many jurisdictions, we caution against overly focusing on vaccination to the exclusion of other crucial elements for wider protection of HCWs, especially in facing ongoing mutations which may escape current vaccines.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of booster vaccination of adults with measles-mumps-rubella in the COVID-19 infection rates. Methods: In order to investigate this hypothesis, we tested COVID-19 positivity rate through PCR assay on the participants (n=245; male), who had to share the same student accommodation together with the same dining hall to provide governmental service. Participants were divided into two groups based on their booster vaccination status with measles-mumps-rubella: the non-vaccinated group (n=207) and the vaccinated group (n=38). The rate of COVID-19 seropositivity, age, body mass index (BMI), active smoking and presence of comorbidity were also measured and recorded. Results: All of the participants were healthy, and age distribution, comorbidity rates, active smoking status and BMI did not vary significantly among the two groups (p=0.305, p=0.594, p=0.280, and p=0.922, respectively). About 36.7% (n=90) of the participants were found to be COVID-19 positive by PCR among which the non-vaccinated cases had higher rates of COVID-19 seropositivity than the vaccinated cases (40.6% vs 15.8%) (OR=3.6, 95%CI: 1.5–9.0, p=0.004). Conclusion: Based on these results, we cautiously predict that immunity produced by MMR vaccination boosters may provide some degree of protection against COVID-19 in the adult population.

N2  - Background: We estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of mRNA vaccines among US Veterans during periods of Delta and Omicron variant dominance. Patients included in this study were largely 65 years or older (62,834, 55%), male (101,259, 88%), and non-Hispanic white (66,986, 58%). Methods: We used SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test results to conduct a matched test-negative case-control study to estimate VE of three and two doses of mRNA vaccines against infection (regardless of symptoms), and a matched case-control study to estimate VE against COVID-19related hospitalization and death. We estimated VE as (1- odds ratio) x 100%. Severity of disease was measured using hospital length of stay (LOS) and admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Results: Against infection, booster doses had 7-times higher VE - 59% (95% confidence interval [CI], 57 to 61) - than 2-dose VE (7%; 95% CI, 3 to 10) during the Omicron period. For the Delta period, estimated VE against infection was 90% (95% CI, 88 to 92) among boosted vaccinees, 64% higher than VE among 2-dose vaccinees [55% (95% CI, 51 to 58)]. Against hospitalization, booster dose VE was 87% (95% CI, 80 to 91) during Omicron and 95% (95% CI, 91 to 97) during Delta; the 2-dose VE was 44% (95% CI, 26 to 58) during Omicron and 75% (95% CI, 70 to 80) during Delta. Against death, estimated VE with a booster dose was 94% (95% CI, 85 to 98) during Omicron and 96% (95% CI, 88 to 99) during Delta, while the 2-dose VE was 75% (95% CI, 52 to 87) during Omicron and 93% (95% CI, 85 to 97) during Delta. During the Omicron period, average hospital LOS was 4 days shorter [3 days (95%CI, 3 to 4 days)] than during the Delta period. Conclusions: A mRNA vaccine booster is more effective against infection, hospitalization, and death than 2-dose vaccination among an older male population with comorbidities.

N2  - Introduction. The new type of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (Corona virus 2019- COVID-19) infection is the largest pandemic in the last decade. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the complication of this infection with highest mortality and there is no medical treatment to reduce mortality with proven efficacy yet. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of high dose vitamin C (ascorbic asid) on survival and other ICU outcomes of patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS who need invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Methods. In this multicenter, non-intenventional retrospective cohort study, patients who were hospitalized in Intensive Care Units (ICU) due to confirmed C0VID-19 associated ARDS and needed invasive IMV from 5 centers between March 2020 and July 2020 were included. Among these patients, those receiving vitamin C treatment over 200 mg/kg for 4 days were defined as the high-dose vitamin C group, and those who did not take vitamin C as defined as control group by using propensity score match analysis. The primary endpoint of study was ICU mortality. Results. A total of 86 patients with a mean age of 67.85 ± 10.38 were included in the study, 72.1% of whom were male. The median APACHE II score of the patients was 19.5 (15.0-26.0). 42 of them were in the high dose vitamin C group and 44 of them were in the control group. The mortality of the group that received high dose vitamin C treatment was found to be lower than the group that did not (73.8% vs 90.9%; p = 0.037). The duration of MV [10.0 (7.0-18.0) vs 11.0 (6.5- 17.0); p = 0.92) wasn't differen and the duration of stay in the ICU (median 15 ve 13, p = 0.016) were longer in the high-dose vitamin C group. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of other ICU clinical outcomes (acute renal failure, liver damage, thrombosis /infarction, etc.) (p > 0.05). Conclusion. High dose of vitamin C as an adjunctive therapy in invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS can reduce mortality. Further prospective, randomised controlled trials are required to confirm these findings.

N2  - Background: There is strong evidence regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine in preventing symptomatic infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is a relative paucity of data regarding its effectiveness in the prevention of asymptomatic infection. Methods: In this real-world observational study, we identified a subpopulation of individuals in a large health maintenance organization who were repeatedly tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We included these individuals in the study cohort and compared those who were vaccinated with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to unvaccinated individuals. A positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result was used as the outcome. The follow-up period was from January 1, 2021, until February 11, 2021. Results: A total of 6286 individuals were included in the cohort. Seven days after the second vaccine dose, a rate of 6 positive PCR tests per 10 000 person-days was recorded, compared with a rate of 53 positive tests per 10 000 person-days for the unvaccinated group. The estimated vaccine effectiveness against infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus after 2 vaccine doses was 89% (95% CI, 82%-94%). The estimated effectiveness 2 weeks after the first vaccine dose was 61% (95% CI, 49%-71%). Conclusions: In this study, vaccination with BNT162b2 reduced infection rates among individuals who underwent screening by frequent SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Using a cohort of frequently tested individuals reduced the indication bias for the PCR testing, which enabled estimation of infection rates.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global effort to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was found to be safe and effective in a nationwide mass vaccination setting and among cancer patients with solid tumors. The legalization of cannabis' medicinal use is rapidly increasing worldwide, and its use in patients with cancer is growing. Data suggest cannabis and its active ingredients have immune-modulating effects. We aimed to evaluate the effect of medical cannabis use on the efficacy and safety of the BNT162b2 vaccine in cancer patients. Methods: The study was conducted as a subgroup analysis of a prospective study to evaluate vaccine outcomes in a cohort of patients with solid malignancies undergoing anti-cancer therapy. Serologic tests for the detection of anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were performed after the second vaccination. Questionnaires regarding adverse reactions were administered at serum collection and electronic medical records were reviewed for demographic data, disease characteristics, cannabis use, and documentation of COVID-19 infection. Results: Of the 229 patients who participated in the study, 52 received medical marijuana (23%). A trend towards higher rate of seronegativity was reported for patients treated with medical cannabis (23% vs 12%, p-0.08). This trend was even higher in patients treated only with Cannabidiol (CBD) compounds (40%). Safety profile was similar to the entire cohort, with the exception of fatigue, which was more common in the cannabis group (38% vs 19% respectively p-0.01). Conclusions: The results of this study might indicate a trend of lower immunogenicity in the subgroup of patients with solid malignancies who are also treated with medical cannabis. Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors. Funding: Has not received any funding. Disclosure: All authors have declared no conflicts of interest.

N2  - Background. COVID-19 presents a serious health risk to pregnant people and pregnancy outcomes. However, pregnant people were not included in pivotal phase III COVID-19 vaccine efficacy trials. Methods. We used Cox regression models in a cohort study to determine hazard ratios (HR) of a PCR positive test (“infection”) comparing vaccinated with unvaccinated pregnant persons in Kaiser Permanente Northern California. HRs were adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, type of insurance coverage, geographical area, BMI, preexisting diabetes, hypertension, parity, time since pregnancy onset and smoking status. Vaccine effectiveness (VE), calculated as 1 minus adjusted HR, was estimated for fully vaccinated < 150 and ≥ 150 days prior to infection. VE was estimated for before and during Delta, and Omicron. We also calculated incidence rates of COVID-pneumonia associated hospitalization by vaccination status. Results. Among 68836 pregnancies between 12/15/2020 and 3/31/2022, 21834 (31.7%) were fully vaccinated and 5980 (8.7%) were boosted by the end of pregnancy. Compared with unvaccinated persons, the HRs of infection for fully vaccinated < 150 days prior were 0.13 (95% CI: 0.07 - 0.23; VE=87% [77% - 93%]) before Delta; 0.25 (CI: 0.20 - 0.30; VE=75% [70% - 80%]) during Delta and 0.76 (CI: 0.61 - 0.94; VE= 24% [16% - 39%]) during Omicron. The HRs for ≥ 150 days prior were 0.38 (CI: 0.31 - 0.46; VE=62 % [54% - 69%]) during Delta and 1.04 (CI: 0.89 - 1.22; VE= -0.04% [-0.22% - 0.11%]) during Omicron. The HRs for boosted persons were 0.10 (CI: 0.04 - 0.25; VE= 90% [75% - 96%]) during Delta and 0.42 (CI: 0.34 - 0.52; VE=58% [48% - 66%]) during Omicron periods. Incidence rates (IR) per 1000 person-years for hospitalization before delta were 0.75 among unvaccinated and zero among vaccinated. During Delta, the IR was 6.64 for unvaccinated and zero for fully vaccinated and boosted. During Omicron, the IR was 10.27 for unvaccinated, zero for fully vaccinated < 150 days prior, 2.48 for fully vaccinated ≥ 150 days prior and zero for those boosted. Conclusion. COVID-19 vaccines protect against infection and hospitalization among pregnant people. However, vaccine effectiveness against infection wanes over time and was lower during Omicron. Booster doses are necessary for continuous protection.

N2  - The Kingdom of Morocco approved BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm) COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use on 22 January 2021 in a two-dose, three-to-four-week interval schedule. We conducted a case-control study to determine real-world BBIBP-CorV vaccine effectiveness (VE) against serious or critical hospitalization of individuals RT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the first five months of BBIBP-CorV use in Morocco. The study was conducted among adults 18-99 years old who were tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1 February and 30 June 2021. RT-PCR results were individually linked with outcomes from the COVID-19 severe or critical hospitalization dataset and with vaccination histories from the national vaccination registration system. Individuals with partial vaccination (<2 weeks after dose two) or in receipt of any other COVID-19 vaccine were excluded. Unadjusted and adjusted VE estimates against hospitalization for serious or critical illness were made by comparing two-dose vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in logistic regression models, calculated as (1-odds ratio) * 100%. There were 348,190 individuals able to be matched across the three databases. Among these, 140,892 were fully vaccinated, 206,149 were unvaccinated, and 1,149 received homologous BBIBP-CorV booster doses. Unadjusted, full-series, unboosted BBIBP-CorV VE against hospitalization for serious or critical illness was 90.2% (95%CI: 87.8% - 92.0%). Full-series, unboosted VE, adjusted for age, sex, and calendar day of RT-PCR test, was 88.5% (95%CI: 85.8% - 90.7%). Calendar day- and sex-adjusted VE ranged from 93.9% to 100% for individuals <60 years, and was 53.3% for individuals 60 years and older. There were no serious or critical illnesses among BBIBP-CorV-boosted individuals. Effectiveness of Sinopharm’s BBIBP-CorV was consistent with phase III clinical trial results. Two doses of BBIBP-CorV was highly protective against COVID-19-associated serious or critical hospitalization in working-age adults under real-world conditions and moderately effective in older adults. Booster dose VE should be evaluated, as booster doses of BBIBP-CorV are recommended and are being used.

N2  - The durability of immune responses after COVID-19 vaccination will drive long-term vaccine effectiveness across settings and may differ by vaccine type. To determine durability of protection of COVID-19 vaccines (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and Ad26.COV2.S) following primary vaccination in the United States, a matched case-control study was conducted in three cohorts between 1 January and 7 September 2021 using de-identified data from a database covering 168 million lives. Odds ratios (ORs) for developing outcomes of interest (breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, or intensive care unit admission) were determined for each vaccine (no direct comparisons). In total, 17,017,435 individuals were identified. Relative to the baseline, stable protection was observed for Ad26.COV2.S against infections (OR [95% confidence interval (CI)], 1.31 [1.18–1.47]) and hospitalizations (OR [95% CI], 1.25 [0.86–1.80]). Relative to the baseline, protection waned over time against infections for BNT162b2 (OR [95% CI], 2.20 [2.01–2.40]) and mRNA-1273 (OR [95% CI], 2.07 [1.87–2.29]) and against hospitalizations for BNT162b2 (OR [95% CI], 2.38 [1.79–3.17]). Baseline protection remained stable for intensive care unit admissions for all three vaccines. Calculated baseline VE was consistent with published literature. This study suggests that the three vaccines in three separate populations may have different durability profiles.

N2  - Background: Intrinsic durability of immune responses elicited by COVID-19 vaccines will drive vaccine effectiveness long-term across settings and may differ by vaccine type. We aimed here to determine durability of protection of three COVID-19 vaccines BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 and Ad26.COV2.S following primary vaccination against breakthrough infections, hospitalisations, and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in the United States (US). Methods: Using national claims and laboratory data covering 168 million lives, we conducted a matched case-control study with fully vaccinated individuals between January 1 and September 7, 2021. Odds ratios (OR) for developing outcomes in months two through six following primary vaccination were estimated relative to the first month after primary vaccination for each vaccine separately. Results compare each vaccine to itself and are not directly comparative. Odds ratios were translated into vaccine effectiveness (VE) using assumptions about event rates in an unvaccinated cohort. Findings: Relative to its baseline, stable protection was observed for the single-shot Ad26.COV2.S against infections and severe disease. Relative to their baseline protection waned overtime against infections for BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 and against hospitalisations for BNT162b2. No waning of baseline protection was observed at any time for ICU admissions for all three vaccines. Calculated baseline VE was consistent with the published literature. Interpretation: While the starting protection level provided by the primary series may differ by vaccine type and mechanism of action, this study demonstrated by comparing each vaccine to its own baseline protection that the three vaccines in three separate populations may have different durability profiles. Further investigation is required to fully characterize the durability profile of the three vaccines. Moreover, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, and as more countries and populations implement a standard of care consisting of three doses of the mRNA vaccines or two doses of Ad26.COV2.S, further investigation is critical to understand the level of protection and the durability of response over longer periods, novel variants and in response to homologous and heterologous boosting.

N2  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have been proven to decrease the severity of acute-phase infection; however, little is known about their effect on postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Methods: Patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and minimum age of 18 years with 3-month follow-up postdiagnosis between 21 September 2020 and 14 December 2021 were identified from the TriNetX Research Network platform. The primary outcomes consisted of new-onset or persistent symptoms, new-onset diagnoses, and death and were compared between vaccine and no-vaccine groups. Results: At baseline, 1 578 719 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were identified and 1.6% (n = 25 225) completed vaccination. After matching, there were no differences (P >. 05) in demographics or preexisting comorbidities. At 28 days following COVID-19 diagnosis, the incidence of hypertension was 13.52 per 1000, diabetes was 5.98 per 1000, thyroid disease was 3.80 per 1000, heart disease was 15.41 per 1000, and mental disorders was 14.77 per 1000 in the vaccine cohort. At 90 days following COVID-19 diagnosis, the relative risk of hypertension was 0.33 (95% confidence interval [CI],. 26-.42), diabetes was 0.28 (95% CI,. 20-.38), heart disease was 0.35 (95% CI,. 29-.44), and death was 0.21 (95% CI,. 16-.27). Differences in both 28-and 90-day risk between the vaccine and no-vaccine cohorts were observed for each outcome, and there was enough evidence (P <. 05) to suggest that these differences were attributed to the vaccine. Conclusions: Our data suggest that COVID-19 vaccine is protective against PASC symptoms, new onset of health conditions, and mortality.

N2  - Background/Purpose: Effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for adolescents with juvenile-onset inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD) is unknown. Several studies suggested attenuated immunogenicity in patients with IRD. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in preventing COVID-19 infection in adolescents with juvenile-onset IRD compared to controls without immune rheumatic disease. Methods: We used data from Clalit Health Services, the largest healthcare organization in Israel, to conduct an observational cohort study from February to December 2021, involving adolescents 12-18 years-old, diagnosed with IRD. Study outcomes included documented COVID-19 infection in relation to vaccination status and immunomodulatory therapy. We estimated vaccine effectiveness as one minus the risk ratio. Adolescents without immune rheumatic disease, 12-18 years-old, served as controls. Results: A total of 1,639 adolescents with IRD (juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or familial Mediterranean fever) were included and compared to 524,471 adolescents in the same age range. There was no difference in COVID-19 infection rates after the second dose of vaccine for those with IRD and controls (2.1% vs. 2.1% respectively, p=0.99). The estimated vaccine effectiveness for adolescents with IRD was 76.3% after the first dose, 94.8% after the second and 99.2% after the third dose. Conclusion: We found that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is effective against COVID-19 infection in adolescents with IRD, similar to controls without immune rheumatic disease. Immunomodulatory therapy did not affect its effectiveness. These results can encourage adolescents with IRD to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

N2  - Introduction: The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for adolescents with juvenile-onset autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) is unknown. Several studies suggest attenuated immunogenicity in patients with AIIRD. Objectives: This study evaluated the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in preventing COVID-19 infection in adolescents with juvenile-onset AIIRD compared to healthy controls. Methods: We used data from Clalit Health Services, the largest healthcare organization in Israel, to conduct an observational cohort study from June to December 2021, involving adolescents ages 12-18 years, diagnosed with AIIRD. Study outcomes included documented COVID-19 infection in relation to vaccination status and immunomodulatory therapy. We estimated vaccine effectiveness as one minus the risk ratio. Healthy adolescents in the same age group served as controls. Results: A total of 1,639 adolescents with AIIRD (juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or familial Mediterranean fever) were included and compared to 524,471 adolescents in the same age range. There was no difference in COVID-19 infection rates after the second dose of vaccine for those with AIIRD and healthy controls (2.1% vs. 2.1% respectively, p=0.99). The estimated vaccine effectiveness for adolescents with AIIRD was 76.3% after the first dose, 94.8% after the second and 99.2% after the third dose. Conclusion: We found that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is highly effective against COVID-19 in adolescents with AIIRD, similar to healthy controls. Immunomodulatory therapy did not affect its effectiveness. These results can encourage adolescents with AIIRD to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
