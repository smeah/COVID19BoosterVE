TI  - Association of Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection With Risk of Breakthrough Infection 
      Following mRNA Vaccination in Qatar.
PG  - 1930-1939

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The effect of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection on vaccine protection 
      remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To assess protection from SARS-CoV-2 
      breakthrough infection after mRNA vaccination among persons with vs without prior 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Matched-cohort studies 
      in Qatar for the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines. A 
      total of 1 531 736 individuals vaccinated with either vaccine between December 
      21, 2020, and September 19, 2021, were followed up beginning 14 days after 
      receiving the second dose until September 19, 2021. EXPOSURES: Prior SARS-CoV-2 
      infection and COVID-19 vaccination. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive 
      nasopharyngeal swab regardless of reason for PCR testing or presence of symptoms. 
      Cumulative incidence was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator method. 
      RESULTS: The BNT162b2-vaccinated cohort comprised 99 226 individuals with and 290 
      432 matched individuals without prior PCR-confirmed infection (median age, 37 
      years; 68% male). The mRNA-1273-vaccinated cohort comprised 58 096 individuals 
      with and 169 514 matched individuals without prior PCR-confirmed infection 
      (median age, 36 years; 73% male). Among BNT162b2-vaccinated persons, 159 
      reinfections occurred in those with and 2509 in those without prior infection 14 
      days or more after dose 2. Among mRNA-1273-vaccinated persons, 43 reinfections 
      occurred in those with and 368 infections in those without prior infection. 
      Cumulative infection incidence among BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals was an 
      estimated 0.15% (95% CI, 0.12%-0.18%) in those with and 0.83% (95% CI, 
      0.79%-0.87%) in those without prior infection at 120 days of follow-up (adjusted 
      hazard ratio for breakthrough infection with prior infection, 0.18 [95% CI, 
      0.15-0.21]; P < .001). Cumulative infection incidence among mRNA-1273-vaccinated 
      individuals was an estimated 0.11% (95% CI, 0.08%-0.15%) in those with and 0.35% 
      (95% CI, 0.32%-0.40%) in those without prior infection at 120 days of follow-up 
      (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.25-0.48]; P < .001). Vaccinated 
      individuals with prior infection 6 months or more before dose 1 had statistically 
      significantly lower risk for breakthrough infection than those vaccinated less 
      than 6 months before dose 1 (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.42-0.92]; 
      P = .02 for BNT162b2 and 0.40 [95% CI, 0.18-0.91]; P = .03 for mRNA-1273 
      vaccination). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was 
      associated with a statistically significantly lower risk for breakthrough 
      infection among individuals receiving the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines in Qatar 
      between December 21, 2020, and September 19, 2021. The observational study design 
      precludes direct comparisons of infection risk between the 2 vaccines.

TI  - Effect of mRNA Vaccine Boosters against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Infection in Qatar.
PG  - 1804-1816

AB  - BACKGROUND: Waning of vaccine protection against coronavirus disease 2019 
      (Covid-19) and the emergence of the omicron (or B.1.1.529) variant of the severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have led to expedited 
      efforts to scale up booster vaccination. Protection conferred by booster doses of 
      the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines in Qatar, as 
      compared with protection conferred by the two-dose primary series, is unclear. 
      METHODS: We conducted two matched retrospective cohort studies to assess the 
      effectiveness of booster vaccination, as compared with that of a two-dose primary 
      series alone, against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and Covid-19-related 
      hospitalization and death during a large wave of omicron infections from December 
      19, 2021, through January 26, 2022. The association of booster status with 
      infection was estimated with the use of Cox proportional-hazards regression 
      models. RESULTS: In a population of 2,239,193 persons who had received at least 
      two doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine, those who had also received a booster 
      were matched with persons who had not received a booster. Among the 
      BNT162b2-vaccinated persons, the cumulative incidence of symptomatic omicron 
      infection was 2.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3 to 2.5) in the booster 
      cohort and 4.5% (95% CI, 4.3 to 4.6) in the nonbooster cohort after 35 days of 
      follow-up. Booster effectiveness against symptomatic omicron infection, as 
      compared with that of the primary series, was 49.4% (95% CI, 47.1 to 51.6). 
      Booster effectiveness against Covid-19-related hospitalization and death due to 
      omicron infection, as compared with the primary series, was 76.5% (95% CI, 55.9 
      to 87.5). BNT162b2 booster effectiveness against symptomatic infection with the 
      delta (or B.1.617.2) variant, as compared with the primary series, was 86.1% (95% 
      CI, 67.3 to 94.1). Among the mRNA-1273-vaccinated persons, the cumulative 
      incidence of symptomatic omicron infection was 1.0% (95% CI, 0.9 to 1.2) in the 
      booster cohort and 1.9% (95% CI, 1.8 to 2.1) in the nonbooster cohort after 35 
      days; booster effectiveness against symptomatic omicron infection, as compared 
      with the primary series, was 47.3% (95% CI, 40.7 to 53.3). Few severe Covid-19 
      cases were noted in the mRNA-1273-vaccinated cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The messenger 
      RNA (mRNA) boosters were highly effective against symptomatic delta infection, 
      but they were less effective against symptomatic omicron infection. However, with 
      both variants, mRNA boosters led to strong protection against Covid-19-related 
      hospitalization and death. (Funded by Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar and others.).

TI  - Association Between 3 Doses of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine and Symptomatic Infection 
      Caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and Delta Variants.
PG  - 639-651

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Assessing COVID-19 vaccine performance against the rapidly spreading 
      SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is critical to inform public health guidance. 
      OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between receipt of 3 doses of 
      Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 or Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 
      infection, stratified by variant (Omicron and Delta). DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: A test-negative case-control analysis among adults 18 years or 
      older with COVID-like illness tested December 10, 2021, through January 1, 2022, 
      by a national pharmacy-based testing program (4666 COVID-19 testing sites across 
      49 US states). EXPOSURES: Three doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (third dose ≥14 
      days before test and ≥6 months after second dose) vs unvaccinated and vs 2 doses 
      6 months or more before test (ie, eligible for a booster dose). MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Association between symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (stratified by 
      Omicron or Delta variants defined using S-gene target failure) and vaccination (3 
      doses vs unvaccinated and 3 doses vs 2 doses). Associations were measured with 
      multivariable multinomial regression. Among cases, a secondary outcome was median 
      cycle threshold values (inversely proportional to the amount of target nucleic 
      acid present) for 3 viral genes, stratified by variant and vaccination status. 
      RESULTS: Overall, 23 391 cases (13 098 Omicron; 10 293 Delta) and 46 764 controls 
      were included (mean age, 40.3 [SD, 15.6] years; 42 050 [60.1%] women). Prior 
      receipt of 3 mRNA vaccine doses was reported for 18.6% (n = 2441) of Omicron 
      cases, 6.6% (n = 679) of Delta cases, and 39.7% (n = 18 587) of controls; prior 
      receipt of 2 mRNA vaccine doses was reported for 55.3% (n = 7245), 44.4% 
      (n = 4570), and 41.6% (n = 19 456), respectively; and being unvaccinated was 
      reported for 26.0% (n = 3412), 49.0% (n = 5044), and 18.6% (n = 8721), 
      respectively. The adjusted odds ratio for 3 doses vs unvaccinated was 0.33 (95% 
      CI, 0.31-0.35) for Omicron and 0.065 (95% CI, 0.059-0.071) for Delta; for 3 
      vaccine doses vs 2 doses the adjusted odds ratio was 0.34 (95% CI, 0.32-0.36) for 
      Omicron and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.14-0.17) for Delta. Median cycle threshold values 
      were significantly higher in cases with 3 doses vs 2 doses for both Omicron and 
      Delta (Omicron N gene: 19.35 vs 18.52; Omicron ORF1ab gene: 19.25 vs 18.40; Delta 
      N gene: 19.07 vs 17.52; Delta ORF1ab gene: 18.70 vs 17.28; Delta S gene: 23.62 vs 
      20.24). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among individuals seeking testing for 
      COVID-like illness in the US in December 2021, receipt of 3 doses of mRNA 
      COVID-19 vaccine (compared with unvaccinated and with receipt of 2 doses) was 
      less likely among cases with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with 
      test-negative controls. These findings suggest that receipt of 3 doses of mRNA 
      vaccine, relative to being unvaccinated and to receipt of 2 doses, was associated 
      with protection against both the Omicron and Delta variants, although the higher 
      odds ratios for Omicron suggest less protection for Omicron than for Delta.

LID - 10.1101/2022.06.09.22276228 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: To compare the effectiveness of a primary COVID-19 vaccine series 
      plus a booster dose with a primary series alone for the prevention of Omicron 
      variant COVID-19 hospitalization. Design: Multicenter observational case-control 
      study using the test-negative design to evaluate vaccine effectiveness (VE). 
      Setting: Twenty-one hospitals in the United States (US). Participants: 3,181 
      adults hospitalized with an acute respiratory illness between December 26, 2021 
      and April 30, 2022, a period of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (BA.1, BA.2) 
      predominance. Participants included 1,572 (49%) case-patients with laboratory 
      confirmed COVID-19 and 1,609 (51%) control patients who tested negative for 
      SARS-CoV-2. Median age was 64 years, 48% were female, and 21% were 
      immunocompromised; 798 (25%) were vaccinated with a primary series plus booster, 
      1,326 (42%) were vaccinated with a primary series alone, and 1,057 (33%) were 
      unvaccinated. Main Outcome Measures: VE against COVID-19 hospitalization was 
      calculated for a primary series plus a booster and a primary series alone by 
      comparing the odds of being vaccinated with each of these regimens versus being 
      unvaccinated among cases versus controls. VE analyses were stratified by immune 
      status (immunocompetent; immunocompromised) because the recommended vaccine 
      schedules are different for these groups. The primary analysis evaluated all 
      COVID-19 vaccine types combined and secondary analyses evaluated specific vaccine 
      products. Results: Among immunocompetent patients, VE against Omicron COVID-19 
      hospitalization for a primary series plus one booster of any vaccine product dose 
      was 77% (95% CI: 71-82%), and for a primary series alone was 44% (95% CI: 31-54%) 
      (p<0.001). VE was higher for a boosted regimen than a primary series alone for 
      both mRNA vaccines used in the US (BNT162b2: primary series plus booster VE 80% 
      (95% CI: 73-85%), primary series alone VE 46% (95% CI: 30-58%) [p<0.001]; 
      mRNA-1273: primary series plus booster VE 77% (95% CI: 67-83%), primary series 
      alone VE 47% (95% CI: 30-60%) [p<0.001]). Among immunocompromised patients, VE 
      for a primary series of any vaccine product against Omicron COVID-19 
      hospitalization was 60% (95% CI: 41-73%). Insufficient sample size has 
      accumulated to calculate effectiveness of boosted regimens for immunocompromised 
      patients. Conclusions: Among immunocompetent people, a booster dose of COVID-19 
      vaccine provided additional benefit beyond a primary vaccine series alone for 
      preventing COVID-19 hospitalization due to the Omicron variant.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of a primary covid-19 vaccine series plus 
      booster doses with a primary series alone for the prevention of hospital 
      admission with omicron related covid-19 in the United States. DESIGN: Multicenter 
      observational case-control study with a test negative design. SETTING: Hospitals 
      in 18 US states. PARTICIPANTS: 4760 adults admitted to one of 21 hospitals with 
      acute respiratory symptoms between 26 December 2021 and 30 June 2022, a period 
      when the omicron variant was dominant. Participants included 2385 (50.1%) 
      patients with laboratory confirmed covid-19 (cases) and 2375 (49.9%) patients who 
      tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (controls). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main 
      outcome was vaccine effectiveness against hospital admission with covid-19 for a 
      primary series plus booster doses and a primary series alone by comparing the 
      odds of being vaccinated with each of these regimens versus being unvaccinated 
      among cases versus controls. Vaccine effectiveness analyses were stratified by 
      immunosuppression status (immunocompetent, immunocompromised). The primary 
      analysis evaluated all covid-19 vaccine types combined, and secondary analyses 
      evaluated specific vaccine products. RESULTS: Overall, median age of participants 
      was 64 years (interquartile range 52-75 years), 994 (20.8%) were 
      immunocompromised, 85 (1.8%) were vaccinated with a primary series plus two 
      boosters, 1367 (28.7%) with a primary series plus one booster, and 1875 (39.3%) 
      with a primary series alone, and 1433 (30.1%) were unvaccinated. Among 
      immunocompetent participants, vaccine effectiveness for prevention of hospital 
      admission with omicron related covid-19 for a primary series plus two boosters 
      was 63% (95% confidence interval 37% to 78%), a primary series plus one booster 
      was 65% (58% to 71%), and for a primary series alone was 37% (25% to 47%) 
      (P<0.001 for the pooled boosted regimens compared with a primary series alone). 
      Vaccine effectiveness was higher for a boosted regimen than for a primary series 
      alone for both mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech): 73% (44% to 87%) for 
      primary series plus two boosters, 64% (55% to 72%) for primary series plus one 
      booster, and 36% (21% to 48%) for primary series alone (P<0.001); mRNA-1273 
      (Moderna): 68% (17% to 88%) for primary series plus two boosters, 65% (55% to 
      73%) for primary series plus one booster, and 41% (25% to 54%) for primary series 
      alone (P=0.001)). Among immunocompromised patients, vaccine effectiveness for a 
      primary series plus one booster was 69% (31% to 86%) and for a primary series 
      alone was 49% (30% to 63%) (P=0.04). CONCLUSION: During the first six months of 
      2022 in the US, booster doses of a covid-19 vaccine provided additional benefit 
      beyond a primary vaccine series alone for preventing hospital admissions with 
      omicron related covid-19. READERS' NOTE: This article is a living test negative 
      design study that will be updated to reflect emerging evidence. Updates may occur

AB  - The effectiveness of the inactivated BBIBP-CorV vaccine against severe COVID-19 
      outcomes (hospitalization, critical care admission and death due to COVID-19) and 
      its long-term effectiveness have not been well characterized among the general 
      population. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic health 
      records of 3,147,869 adults, of which 1,099,886 vaccinated individuals were 
      matched, in a 1:1 ratio to 1,099,886 unvaccinated persons. A Cox-proportional 
      hazard model with time varying coefficients was used to assess the vaccine 
      effectiveness adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, ethnicity, and the calendar 
      month of entry into the study. Our analysis showed that the effectiveness was 
      79.6% (95% CI, 77.7 to 81.3) against hospitalization, 86% (95% CI, 82.2 to 89.0) 
      against critical care admission, and 84.1% (95% CI, 70.8 to 91.3) against death 
      due to COVID-19. The effectiveness against these severe outcomes declined over 
      time indicating the need for booster doses to increase protection against severe 
      COVID-19 outcomes.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the optimal tocilizumab 
      dosing regimen. METHODS: A two-center, retrospective cohort study, for COVID19 
      critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs). We included 
      critically ill patients aged 18 years or older who received tocilizumab during 
      ICU stay. Patients were divided into two groups based on the number of the 
      received tocilizumab doses. The primary outcome was the in-hospital and 30-day 
      mortality. Propensity score (PS) matching was used (1:1 ratio) based on the 
      selected criteria. RESULTS: A total of 298 patients were included in the study; 
      70.4% (210 patients) received a single dose of tocilizumab. After adjusting for 
      possible confounders, the 30-day mortality (HR 0.79 95% CI 0.43-1.45 P = 0.44) 
      and in-hospital mortality (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.46-1.49; P = 0.53) were not 
      significantly different between the two groups. On the flip side, patients who 
      received multiple doses had higher pneumonia odds than a single dose (OR 3.81; 
      95% CI 1.79-8.12 P = 0.0005). CONCLUSION: Repeating tocilizumab doses were not 
      associated with a mortality benefit in COVID-19 critically ill patients, but it 
      was associated with higher odds of pneumonia compared to a single dose.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading infection 
      that is on the rise. New variants are continuously appearing with variable 
      degrees of lethality and infectivity. The extensive work since the start of the 
      pandemic has led to the evolution of COVID-19 vaccines with varying mechanisms. 
      We aim to determine real-world data by looking at the different clinical outcomes 
      associated with COVID-19 vaccination, focusing on the rate of hospitalization, 
      severity, and mortality. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective observational study 
      included 624 patients with COVID-19 infection who were hospitalized at King Fahad 
      Hospital of the University and King Fahad Military Medical City between April and 
      July 2021. The cohort was divided into 3 groups: unvaccinated, partially 
      vaccinated (PV), and fully vaccinated (FV). The severity and outcome of COVID-19 
      disease were compared among the three groups. Among the vaccinated group, we 
      studied the effect of vaccine type on the severity and outcome of COVID-19 
      disease. RESULTS: We found that 70.4% of patients with COVID-19 disease who 
      required hospitalization were unvaccinated. Un-vaccination was a significant 
      predictor of critical COVID-19 disease (OR 2.31; P <0.001), whereas full 
      vaccination was associated with significantly milder disease severity (OR 0.36; P 
      0.01). Moreover, un-vaccination status was an independent predictor of longer 
      hospitalization (OR 3.0; P <0.001), a higher requirement for ICU admission (OR 
      4.7; P <0.001), mechanical ventilation (OR 3.6; P <0.001), and death (OR 4.8; P 
      <0.001), whereas the FV group had a lower risk of ICU admission (OR 0.49; P 
      0.045). Unvaccinated patients with comorbidities had worse severity and outcome 
      of COVID-19 infection (P<0.05). Both vaccine types (Pfizer and AstraZeneca) had 
      similar protective effects against the worst outcomes of COVID-19 disease. 
      CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccination has been shown to be effective in reducing 
      hospitalization, the severity of COVID-19 infection, and improving outcomes, 
      especially in high-risk group patients. COVID-19 vaccination programs should 
      continue to improve the outcome of such a disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has proven the most effective measure to 
      control the COVID-19 pandemic. Booster doses are being administered with limited 
      knowledge on their need and effect on immunity. OBJECTIVE: To determine the 
      duration of specific T cells, antibodies and neutralization after 2-dose 
      vaccination, to assess the effect of a third dose on adaptive immunity and to 
      explore correlates of protection against breakthrough infection. METHODS: 
      12-month longitudinal assessment of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, IgG and 
      neutralizing antibodies triggered by 2 BNT162b2 doses followed by a third 
      mRNA-1273 dose in a cohort of 77 healthcare workers: 17 with SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      prior to vaccination (recovered) and 60 naïve. RESULTS: Peak levels of cellular 
      and humoral response were achieved 2 weeks after the second dose. Antibodies 
      declined thereafter while T cells reached a plateau 3 months after vaccination. 
      The decline in neutralization was specially marked in naïve individuals and it 
      was this group who benefited most from the third dose, which resulted in a 
      20.9-fold increase in neutralization. Overall, recovered individuals maintained 
      higher levels of T cells, antibodies and neutralization 1 to 6 months 
      post-vaccination than naïve. Seventeen asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 
      breakthrough infections were reported during follow-up, only in naïve 
      individuals. This viral exposure boosted adaptive immunity. High peak levels of T 
      cells and neutralizing antibodies 15 days post-vaccination associated with 
      protection from breakthrough infections. CONCLUSION: Booster vaccination in naïve 
      individuals and the inclusion of viral antigens other than spike in future 
      vaccine formulations could be useful strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 
      breakthrough infections.

TI  - COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infection among fully vaccinated healthcare workers 
      in Duhok governorate, Iraqi Kurdistan: A retrospective cohort study.
PG  - 5244-5250
LID - 10.1002/jmv.27985 [doi]
AB  - The aims of this study were: to determine the incidence of Severe Acute 
      Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among vaccinated 
      healthcare workers (HCWs), assess risk factors associated with the vaccine 
      breakthrough (BT), and compare the effectiveness of vaccine manufacturers against 
      SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern among HCWs in Duhok governorate. It is a 
      multicenter retrospective cohort study, which enrolled 944 HCWs through March 
      2022. COVID-19 vaccinated HCWs aging 18 and above were included. A random 
      sampling process was performed by asking the participants to fill out a 
      standardized questionnaire by means of interviews or participant-completed 
      surveys. Fully vaccinated HCWs with positive polymerase chain reaction tests were 
      considered to have vaccine BT infection. Two hundred and eighty-four (30.1%) out 
      of 944 vaccinated HCWs had SARS-CoV-2 infection postvaccination, of whom 241 
      (84.9%) were fully vaccinated, concluding that the incidence of BT infection is 
      25.5%. There were 422 (44.7%) males and 522 (55.3%) females. Most vaccine BT 
      infections had developed in SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (53.5%). The majority of 
      BT infections were mild to moderate (95.5%). Occupation, namely dentist was a 
      significant risk factor, with a p value of 0.001. HCWs with a history of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection prevaccination were more prone to a vaccine BT infection (p 
      value =0.002). Pfizer vaccine manufacturers revealed the highest effectiveness 
      against BT infection (p value =0.0001). Paramedics showed a significant 
      association with the disease severity (p value =0.02). The three available 
      vaccine manufacturers in the Duhok governorate are effective against COVID-19 BT 
      infections. Dentists and paramedics were significantly associated with poor 
      COVID-19 outcomes.

TI  - Post-vaccination outcomes in association with four COVID-19 vaccines in the 
      Kingdom of Bahrain.

AB  - With the emergence of new SARS-Cov2 variants, critical questions have arisen 
      about: (1) the effectiveness of the available COVID-19 vaccines developed to 
      protect against the original Wuhan (wild type) variant and (2) the magnitude and 
      clinical consequences of post-vaccination infections in the context of the Delta 
      variant of SARS-Cov2. While some "real world" experiences with various vaccines 
      have been reported, to our knowledge, few have examined comparative outcomes of 
      various vaccines in one country as new SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged. Here we 
      present an analysis of COVID-19 related outcomes from a national database in 
      Bahrain, a country with a total population of 1.51 million, where four vaccines 
      were deployed (total vaccinated = 1,003,960 adults): AstraZeneca (AZ/Covishield), 
      Pfizer/BioNtech, Sinopharm and Sputnik V. We compare the four vaccines, based on 
      the following post-vaccination outcomes: SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalisations, 
      ICU admissions and deaths, compared to unvaccinated individuals. We conclude that 
      the four vaccines used in Bahrain were effective in significantly reducing all 
      four COVID-19 related outcomes compared to unvaccinated individuals, prior to, 
      and during the period when the Delta variant predominated in the country. 
      However, compared to the three other vaccines, individuals vaccinated with 
      Sinopharm vaccine had a higher risk of post-vaccination infections, 
      hospitalisations and ICU admissions (e.g., 6.94%, 2.24%, 1.99% and 1.52% of 
      COVID-19 cases of Sinopharm, Sputnik V, Pfizer and Covishield recipients, 
      respectively, required hospitalisation versus 13.66% of COVID-19 cases among 
      unvaccinated individuals); however, given the confounding factors, this needs to 
      be confirmed by further studies. We find no evidence of biased selection for any 
      vaccine, but note waning protection of the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine during the 
      January to June 2021 period in the age > 60 y cohort; however, this cannot be 
      distinguished from the overall fall in hospitalisations overall. Our findings 
      support the value of vaccination in preventing COVID-19 related outcomes, provide 
      real world estimates on the outcomes and frequencies of post-vaccination 
      infections for the four vaccines, which may inform vaccine selection in the 
      context of the Delta variant across the globe.

TI  - Demographic Characteristics and Status of Vaccinated Individuals with a History 
      of COVID-19 Infection Pre- or Post-Vaccination: A Descriptive Study of a 
      Nationally Representative Sample in Saudi Arabia.
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10020323 [doi]
LID - 323
AB  - BACKGROUND: Saudi Arabia expedited the approval of some COVID-19 vaccines and 
      launched mass vaccination campaigns. The aim of this study was to describe the 
      demographics of vaccinated COVID-19 cases and compare the mortality rates of 
      COVID-19 cases who were infected post-vaccination in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This 
      was a retrospective cohort study. We retrieved data for COVID-19 cases who were 
      infected pre- or post-vaccination and had received at least one injection of the 
      Oxford-AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine from 4 December 2020 to 15 October 
      2021. RESULTS: The number of patients who were infected and had received at least 
      one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine was 281,744. Approximately 45% of subjects were 
      infected post-vaccination, and 75% of subjects had received the Pfizer-BioNTech 
      vaccine. Only 0.342% of the patients who were infected post-vaccination died, and 
      447 patients were admitted to ICUs. Most of the patients who were infected with 
      COVID-19 post-vaccination and were admitted to ICUs (69.84%) had received only 
      one dose of the vaccine (p < 0.0001). The mean time to infection for patients who 
      had received one and two doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine were 27 and 8 
      days longer than their counterparts who had received one and two doses of 
      Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, respectively. No difference in the odds of mortality 
      between the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines was found (OR = 
      1.121, 95% CI = [0.907-1.386], p-value = 0.291). Patients who had received two 
      doses of the vaccine had significantly lower odds of mortality compared to those 
      who had received one dose (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Vaccines are vital in 
      combating the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of this study show no difference 
      between the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines in the rate of 
      mortality. However, the number of vaccine doses was significantly associated with 
      a lower risk of mortality. Future studies should examine the effectiveness of 
      different COVID-19 vaccines using real-world data and more robust designs.

PG  - 21-34
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2203965 [doi]
LID - NEJMoa2203965
AB  - BACKGROUND: The protection conferred by natural immunity, vaccination, and both 
      against symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      infection with the BA.1 or BA.2 sublineages of the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant is 
      unclear. METHODS: We conducted a national, matched, test-negative, case-control 
      study in Qatar from December 23, 2021, through February 21, 2022, to evaluate the 
      effectiveness of vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 
      (Moderna), natural immunity due to previous infection with variants other than 
      omicron, and hybrid immunity (previous infection and vaccination) against 
      symptomatic omicron infection and against severe, critical, or fatal coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (Covid-19). RESULTS: The effectiveness of previous infection alone 
      against symptomatic BA.2 infection was 46.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.5 
      to 51.9). The effectiveness of vaccination with two doses of BNT162b2 and no 
      previous infection was negligible (-1.1%; 95% CI, -7.1 to 4.6), but nearly all 
      persons had received their second dose more than 6 months earlier. The 
      effectiveness of three doses of BNT162b2 and no previous infection was 52.2% (95% 
      CI, 48.1 to 55.9). The effectiveness of previous infection and two doses of 
      BNT162b2 was 55.1% (95% CI, 50.9 to 58.9), and the effectiveness of previous 
      infection and three doses of BNT162b2 was 77.3% (95% CI, 72.4 to 81.4). Previous 
      infection alone, BNT162b2 vaccination alone, and hybrid immunity all showed 
      strong effectiveness (>70%) against severe, critical, or fatal Covid-19 due to 
      BA.2 infection. Similar results were observed in analyses of effectiveness 
      against BA.1 infection and of vaccination with mRNA-1273. CONCLUSIONS: No 
      discernable differences in protection against symptomatic BA.1 and BA.2 infection 
      were seen with previous infection, vaccination, and hybrid immunity. Vaccination 
      enhanced protection among persons who had had a previous infection. Hybrid 
      immunity resulting from previous infection and recent booster vaccination 
      conferred the strongest protection. (Funded by Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar and

AB  - Recently approved vaccines have already shown remarkable protection in limiting 
      SARS-CoV-2 associated disease. However, immunologic mechanism(s) of protection, 
      as well as how boosting alters immunity to wildtype and newly emerging strains, 
      remain incompletely understood. Here we deeply profiled the humoral immune 
      response in a cohort of non-human primates immunized with a stable recombinant 
      full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein (NVX-CoV2373) at two dose levels, 
      administered as a single or two-dose regimen with a saponin-based adjuvant 
      Matrix-M™. While antigen dose had some effect on Fc-effector profiles, both 
      antigen dose and boosting significantly altered overall titers, neutralization 
      and Fc-effector profiles, driving unique vaccine-induced antibody fingerprints. 
      Combined differences in antibody effector functions and neutralization were 
      strongly associated with distinct levels of protection in the upper and lower 
      respiratory tract, pointing to the presence of combined, but distinct, 
      compartment-specific neutralization and Fc-mechanisms as key determinants of 
      protective immunity against infection. Moreover, NVX-CoV2373 elicited antibodies 
      functionally target emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, collectively pointing to the 
      critical collaborative role for Fab and Fc in driving maximal protection against 
      SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, the data presented here suggest that a single dose may 
      prevent disease, but that two doses may be essential to block further 
      transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants.

AB  - COVID-19 vaccination protects against the potentially serious consequences of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, but some people have been hesitant to receive the vaccine 
      because of reports that it could affect menstrual bleeding. To determine whether 
      this occurs we prospectively recruited a cohort of 79 individuals, each of whom 
      recorded details of at least three consecutive menstrual cycles, during which 
      time they each received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. In spontaneously 
      cycling participants, COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a delay to the 
      next period, but this change reversed in subsequent unvaccinated cycles. No delay 
      was detected in those taking hormonal contraception. To explore hypotheses about 
      the mechanism by which these menstrual changes occur, we retrospectively 
      recruited a larger cohort, of 1,273 people who had kept a record of their 
      menstrual cycle and vaccination dates. In this cohort, we found a trend toward 
      use of combined hormonal contraception being protective against reporting a 
      delayed period, suggesting that menstrual changes following vaccination may be 
      mediated by perturbations to ovarian hormones. However, we were unable to detect 
      a clear association between the timing of vaccination within the menstrual cycle 
      and reports of menstrual changes. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination 
      can lengthen the menstrual cycle and that this effect may be mediated by ovarian 
      hormones. Importantly, we find that the menstrual cycle returns to its 
      pre-vaccination length in unvaccinated cycles.

TI  - Effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19 
      in Sicily over an Eight-Month Period.

AB  - In order to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the burden of disease, 
      since 27 December 2020, Sicily has introduced a regional COVID-19 vaccination 
      campaign. This study aimed at estimating the effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 
      vaccines on SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19. A retrospective cohort study was 
      carried out on 3,966,976 Sicilian adults aged 18 years or more, who were 
      followed-up from 1 January 2021 to 30 September 2021. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 
      infection, severe COVID-19, and COVID-19 death or intubation during the study 
      period was compared among vaccinated with two mRNA doses and unvaccinated 
      individuals. Cox regression, adjusted for age and sex, and a joint-point analysis 
      on rate trends were performed. Overall, 2,469,320 (62.2%) subjects have been 
      vaccinated and a total of 103,078 (2.6% of the entire population) 
      SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects have been observed including 4693 (0.12%) severe 
      COVID-19, 277 (0.01%) intubated, and 2649 (0.07%) deaths. After two months from 
      vaccination, adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 81.3% against SARS-CoV-2 
      infection, 96.1% against severe COVID-19, and 93.4% against intubation/death. 
      During the eight-month follow-up, statistically significant decreasing 
      effectiveness trends were observed for all the evaluated outcomes (-4.76% per 
      month against SARS-CoV-2 infection; -2.27% per month against severe COVID-19 and 
      -2.26% per month against COVID-19 intubation/death). The study results confirm 
      that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have high real-world effectiveness, especially in the 
      first months after vaccination. The vaccine effectiveness decreases over time 
      and, even if the decrease is relatively small against severe outcomes, the 
      increasing protection wane suggests the need for booster vaccination campaigns.

AB  - Given the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants and the 
      roll-out of booster COVID-19 vaccination, evidence is needed on protection 
      conferred by primary vaccination, booster vaccination and previous SARS-CoV-2 
      infection by variant. We employed a test-negative design on S-gene target failure 
      data from community PCR testing in the Netherlands from 22 November 2021 to 31 
      March 2022 (n = 671,763). Previous infection, primary vaccination or both 
      protected well against Delta infection. Protection against Omicron BA.1 infection 
      was much lower compared to Delta. Protection was similar against Omicron BA.1 
      compared to BA.2 infection after previous infection, primary and booster 
      vaccination. Higher protection was observed against all variants in individuals 
      with both vaccination and previous infection compared with either one. Protection 
      against all variants decreased over time since last vaccination or infection. We 
      found that primary vaccination with current COVID-19 vaccines and previous 
      SARS-CoV-2 infections offered low protection against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 
      infection. Booster vaccination considerably increased protection against Omicron 
      infection, but decreased rapidly after vaccination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Behavioral changes among Japanese, along with the coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, may affect the seasonal influenza epidemic in Japan and 
      change influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE). METHODS: This single-center, 
      test-negative case-control (TNCC) study estimated influenza VE in children for 
      the first influenza season (2019/20) to overlap the COVID-19 epidemic in. Effects 
      of prior influenza infection and vaccination in children were assessed for the 
      2019-2020 season. RESULTS: Among 386 children, adjusted VE was significant for 
      influenza A/H1N1 (45.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.0-69.7) and influenza B 
      (66.7%; 95% CI: 35.9-82.7). Among patients aged 0-6 years, adjusted VE was 
      significant for influenza A (total: A/H1N1+A/H3N2) (65.0%; 95% CI: 22.2-84.3), 
      influenza A/H1N1 (64.8%; 95% CI: 16.9-85.1) and influenza B (87.4%; 95% CI: 
      50.5-96.8). No VE was observed in patients aged 7-15 years. Administration of two 
      vaccine doses tended to decrease incidences of influenza A (total) and influenza 
      A/H1N1 in patients aged 0-6 years. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of influenza B 
      infection in patients, who had influenza during the previous season, were 
      significantly lower among all participants (0.29; 95% CI: 0.11-0.78) and patients 
      aged 7-15 years (0.34; 95% CI: 0.12-0.94). The adjusted ORs of influenza 
      infections were not significant in patients vaccinated during the previous 
      season. CONCLUSIONS: TNCC-based estimates of influenza VE were consistent despite 
      the overlapping COVID-19 epidemic.

AB  - Booster vaccination with messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines has been offered to adults 
      in England starting on 14 September 2021. We used a test-negative case-control 
      design to estimate the relative effectiveness of a booster dose of BNT162b2 
      (Pfizer-BioNTech) compared to only a two-dose primary course (at least 175 days 
      after the second dose) or unvaccinated individuals from 13 September 2021 to 5 
      December 2021, when Delta variant was dominant in circulation. Outcomes were 
      symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and hospitalization. The relative 
      effectiveness against symptomatic disease 14-34 days after a BNT162b2 or 
      mRNA-1273 (Moderna) booster after a ChAdOx1-S (AstraZeneca) and BNT162b2 as a 
      primary course ranged from around 85% to 95%. Absolute vaccine effectiveness 
      ranged from 94% to 97% and was similar in all age groups. Limited waning was seen 
      10 or more weeks after the booster. Against hospitalization or death, absolute 
      effectiveness of a BNT162b2 booster ranged from around 97% to 99% in all age 
      groups irrespective of the primary course, with no evidence of waning up to 10 
      weeks. This study provides real-world evidence of substantially increased 
      protection from the booster vaccine dose against mild and severe disease 
      irrespective of the primary course.

TI  - Association Between Vaccination With BNT162b2 and Incidence of Symptomatic and 
      Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infections Among Health Care Workers.
PG  - 2457-2465
LID - 10.1001/jama.2021.7152 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Randomized clinical trials have provided estimates of the 
      effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
      but its effect on asymptomatic infections remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To estimate 
      the association of vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine with 
      symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections among health care workers. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort 
      study conducted at a tertiary medical center in Tel Aviv, Israel. Data were 
      collected on symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections confirmed via 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests in health care workers undergoing regular 
      screening with nasopharyngeal swabs between December 20, 2020, and February 25, 
      2021. Logistic regression was used to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) 
      comparing the incidence of infection between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated 
      participants, controlling for demographics and the number of PCR tests performed. 
      EXPOSURES: Vaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine vs unvaccinated status was 
      ascertained from the employee health database. Full vaccination was defined as 
      more than 7 days after receipt of the second vaccine dose. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: The primary outcome was the regression-adjusted IRR for symptomatic and 
      asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection of fully vaccinated vs unvaccinated health care 
      workers. The secondary outcomes included IRRs for partially vaccinated health 
      care workers (days 7-28 after first dose) and for those considered as late fully 
      vaccinated (>21 days after second dose). RESULTS: A total of 6710 health care 
      workers (mean [SD] age, 44.3 [12.5] years; 4465 [66.5%] women) were followed up 
      for a median period of 63 days; 5953 health care workers (88.7%) received at 
      least 1 dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, 5517 (82.2%) received 2 doses, and 757 
      (11.3%) were not vaccinated. Vaccination was associated with older age compared 
      with those who were not vaccinated (mean age, 44.8 vs 40.7 years, respectively) 
      and male sex (31.4% vs 17.7%). Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 8 
      fully vaccinated health care workers and 38 unvaccinated health care workers 
      (incidence rate, 4.7 vs 149.8 per 100 000 person-days, respectively, adjusted 
      IRR, 0.03 [95% CI, 0.01-0.06]). Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 19 
      fully vaccinated health care workers and 17 unvaccinated health care workers 
      (incidence rate, 11.3 vs 67.0 per 100 000 person-days, respectively, adjusted 
      IRR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.07-0.31]). The results were qualitatively unchanged by the 
      propensity score sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among health 
      care workers at a single center in Tel Aviv, Israel, receipt of the BNT162b2 
      vaccine compared with no vaccine was associated with a significantly lower 
      incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection more than 7 days 
      after the second dose. Findings are limited by the observational design.

TI  - Risk factors and disease profile of post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection in UK 
      users of the COVID Symptom Study app: a prospective, community-based, nested, 
      case-control study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccines show excellent efficacy in clinical trials and 
      effectiveness in real-world data, but some people still become infected with 
      SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination. This study aimed to identify risk factors for 
      post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection and describe the characteristics of 
      post-vaccination illness. METHODS: This prospective, community-based, nested, 
      case-control study used self-reported data (eg, on demographics, geographical 
      location, health risk factors, and COVID-19 test results, symptoms, and 
      vaccinations) from UK-based, adult (≥18 years) users of the COVID Symptom Study 
      mobile phone app. For the risk factor analysis, cases had received a first or 
      second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine between Dec 8, 2020, and July 4, 2021; had 
      either a positive COVID-19 test at least 14 days after their first vaccination 
      (but before their second; cases 1) or a positive test at least 7 days after their 
      second vaccination (cases 2); and had no positive test before vaccination. Two 
      control groups were selected (who also had not tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 
      before vaccination): users reporting a negative test at least 14 days after their 
      first vaccination but before their second (controls 1) and users reporting a 
      negative test at least 7 days after their second vaccination (controls 2). 
      Controls 1 and controls 2 were matched (1:1) with cases 1 and cases 2, 
      respectively, by the date of the post-vaccination test, health-care worker 
      status, and sex. In the disease profile analysis, we sub-selected participants 
      from cases 1 and cases 2 who had used the app for at least 14 consecutive days 
      after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 3 and cases 4, respectively). 
      Controls 3 and controls 4 were unvaccinated participants reporting a positive 
      SARS-CoV-2 test who had used the app for at least 14 consecutive days after the 
      test, and were matched (1:1) with cases 3 and 4, respectively, by the date of the 
      positive test, health-care worker status, sex, body-mass index (BMI), and age. We 
      used univariate logistic regression models (adjusted for age, BMI, and sex) to 
      analyse the associations between risk factors and post-vaccination infection, and 
      the associations of individual symptoms, overall disease duration, and disease 
      severity with vaccination status. FINDINGS: Between Dec 8, 2020, and July 4, 
      2021, 1 240 009 COVID Symptom Study app users reported a first vaccine dose, of 
      whom 6030 (0·5%) subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 1), and 
      971 504 reported a second dose, of whom 2370 (0·2%) subsequently tested positive 
      for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 2). In the risk factor analysis, frailty was associated 
      with post-vaccination infection in older adults (≥60 years) after their first 
      vaccine dose (odds ratio [OR] 1·93, 95% CI 1·50-2·48; p<0·0001), and individuals 
      living in highly deprived areas had increased odds of post-vaccination infection 
      following their first vaccine dose (OR 1·11, 95% CI 1·01-1·23; p=0·039). 
      Individuals without obesity (BMI <30 kg/m(2)) had lower odds of infection 
      following their first vaccine dose (OR 0·84, 95% CI 0·75-0·94; p=0·0030). For the 
      disease profile analysis, 3825 users from cases 1 were included in cases 3 and 
      906 users from cases 2 were included in cases 4. Vaccination (compared with no 
      vaccination) was associated with reduced odds of hospitalisation or having more 
      than five symptoms in the first week of illness following the first or second 
      dose, and long-duration (≥28 days) symptoms following the second dose. Almost all 
      symptoms were reported less frequently in infected vaccinated individuals than in 
      infected unvaccinated individuals, and vaccinated participants were more likely 
      to be completely asymptomatic, especially if they were 60 years or older. 
      INTERPRETATION: To minimise SARS-CoV-2 infection, at-risk populations must be 
      targeted in efforts to boost vaccine effectiveness and infection control 
      measures. Our findings might support caution around relaxing physical distancing 
      and other personal protective measures in the post-vaccination era, particularly 
      around frail older adults and individuals living in more deprived areas, even if 
      these individuals are vaccinated, and might have implications for strategies such 
      as booster vaccinations. FUNDING: ZOE, the UK Government Department of Health and

AB  - Although nationwide immunization with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines began in February 
      2021, the evaluation of vaccine effectiveness (VE) using a test-negative design 
      has not been conducted adequately in Japan. To evaluate the effectiveness of the 
      SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, we conducted a test-negative case-control study during 
      the periods dominated by the Delta and Omicron variants. In total, 518 and 358 
      adult participants with COVID-19-like symptoms were tested for the virus from 
      August to October 2021 (Delta variant predominance) and in February 2022 (Omicron 
      variant surge), at the Kawasaki Saiwai Clinic. During Delta variant predominance, 
      the effectiveness of full vaccination was 90.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
      82.1-94.8) and 97.3% (95% CI: 71.7-99.7) against all COVID-19 and 
      moderate-to-severe disease, respectively. However, partial vaccination failed to 
      show effectiveness against moderate-to-severe COVID-19. The effectiveness of the 
      mRNA vaccines against all COVID-19 infection declined to 16.1% (95% CI: -81.0 to 
      61.1) in February 2022. Our results indicated that, although mRNA vaccines showed 
      significant preventive effects against all COVID-19 during Delta variant 
      predominance, these preventive effects waned during Omicron variant surge. To the 
      best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluated VE in the Japanese 
      population during both periods.

AB  - The rapid emergence of the B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant of SARS-CoV-2 led to a 
      global resurgence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Israeli authorities 
      approved a fourth COVID-19 vaccine dose (second booster) for individuals aged

      Evidence for the effectiveness of a second booster dose in reducing 
      hospitalizations and mortality due to COVID-19 is warranted. This retrospective 
      cohort study included all members of Clalit Health Services who were aged 
      60-100 years and who were eligible for the second booster on 3 January 2022. 
      Hospitalizations and mortality due to COVID-19 in participants who received the 
      second booster were compared with those for participants who received one booster 
      dose. Cox proportional hazards regression models with time-dependent covariates 
      were used to estimate the association between the second booster and 
      hospitalization and death due to COVID-19 while adjusting for demographic factors 
      and coexisting illnesses. A total of 563,465 participants met the eligibility 
      criteria. Of those, 328,597 (58%) received a second booster dose during the 
      40 day study period. Hospitalization due to COVID-19 occurred in 270 of the 
      second-booster recipients and in 550 participants who received one booster dose 
      (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.31-0.43). Death due 
      to COVID-19 occurred in 92 second-booster recipients and in 232 participants who 
      received one booster dose (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.22; 95% CI: 0.17-0.28). This 
      study demonstrates a substantial reduction in hospitalizations and deaths due to 
      COVID-19 conferred by a second booster in Israeli adults aged 60 years and over.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has recently been suggested that influenza vaccination may be a 
      factor associated with decreased COVID-19 mortality. METHODS: An age-matched 
      case-control study based on hospital cases. We included subjects aged 18 years 
      and older with a diagnosis of moderate to severe COVID-19. Infection was 
      corroborated by RT-PCR test for SARS-COV-2. Deceased subjects were considered 
      cases, controls were patients discharged due to improvement of acute symptoms. We 
      used bivariate analysis to determine factors associated with death from COVID-19, 
      and calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: A total of 560 
      patients were included in the study, 214 (38.2%) were considered cases and 346 
      (61.7%) controls. A significant difference was observed with the presence of type 
      2 diabetes mellitus [54% vs. 39.3% between cases and controls, respectively 
      (p=.04)] and having received influenza vaccination (p= .02). Type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus was associated with higher COVID-19 mortality [OR 1.8 (95% CI 1.2-2.5) 
      p=.01], whereas having been immunised against influenza in 2019 was associated 
      with lower mortality in this group of patients [OR .6 (95% CI .4-.9) p=.02]. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccination in the previous year appears to be associated 
      with lower mortality from COVID-19; whereas type 2 diabetes mellitus is confirmed 
      as a condition associated with higher mortality.

AB  - Waning immunity to vaccination represents a major challenge in vaccinology. 
      Whether booster vaccination improves the durability of immune responses is 
      unknown. Here we show, using a cohort of 55 adult vaccinees who received the 
      BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, 
      that a booster (i.e., 3 (rd) immunization) dose at 6 - 10 months increased the 
      half-life of serum neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers to 76 days from 56 - 66 
      days estimated after the primary two-dose vaccination series. A second booster 
      dose (i.e., 4 (th) immunization) more than a year after the primary vaccination 
      increased the half-life further to 88 days. However, despite this modestly 
      improved durability in nAb responses against the Wuhan strain, there was a loss 
      in neutralization capacity against Omicron subvariants, especially the recently 
      emerged variants, BA.2.75.2 and BQ.1.1 (35 and 50-fold drop in titers 
      respectively, relative to the ancestral (WA.1) strain. While only 55 â€" 65% of 
      participants demonstrated a detectable nAb titer against the newer variants after 
      the booster (3 (rd) dose), the response declined to below the detection limit in 
      almost all individuals by 6 months. Notably, even against BA.1 and BA.5, the 
      titers declined rapidly in a third of the vaccinees and were below the detection 
      limit at 6 months. In contrast, booster vaccination induced antigen-specific 
      memory B and T cells that persisted for at least 6 months. Collectively, our data 
      show that the durability of immune responses improves following subsequent 
      booster immunizations; however, the emergence of immune evasive variants reduces 
      the effectiveness of booster doses in preventing infection.

TI  - Outcome and effect of vaccination in SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection in hemodialysis 
      patients: a cohort study.
PG  - 1944-1950
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfac209 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemodialysis patients are at high risk of Covid-19, though 
      vaccination has significant efficacy in preventing and reducing the severity of 
      infection. Little information is available on disease severity and vaccine 
      efficacy since the dissemination of the Omicron variant. METHODS: In a 
      multi-center study, during a period of the epidemic driven by the Omicron 
      variant, all hemodialysis patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 were identified. 
      Outcomes were analyzed according to predictor variables including vaccination 
      status. Risk of infection was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model. 
      RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was identified in 1126 patients including 200 (18%) 
      unvaccinated, 56 (5%) post first dose, 433 (38%) post second dose, and 437 (39%) 
      at least 7 days beyond their third dose. The majority of patients had a mild 
      course but 160 (14%) were hospitalized and 28 (2%) died. In regression models 
      adjusted for age and comorbidity, two-dose vaccination was associated with a 39% 
      (95%CI: 2%-62%) reduction in admissions, but third doses provided additional 
      protection, with a 51% (95%CI: 25%-69%) further reduction in admissions. Among 
      1265 patients at risk at the start of the observation period, SARS-CoV-2 
      infection was observed in 211 (17%). Two-dose vaccination was associated with a 
      41% (95%CI: 3%-64%) reduction in the incidence of infection, with no clear 
      additional effect provided by third doses. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate 
      lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination in dialysis patients 
      during an Omicron dominant period of the epidemic. Among those developing 
      infection, severe illness was less common with prior vaccination, particularly 
      after third vaccine doses.

      on 1640 admitted COVID-19 patients were carried between June 2021 and October 
      2021. Depending on vaccination exposure they were divided into vaccinated 
      (exposed) and unvaccinated (unexposed) groups, excluding partially vaccinated 
      patients. Disease severity was assessed at admission on severity index scale. 
      Disease progression to mortality or need of mechanical ventilation and survival 
      were taken as outcome. Absolute difference with 95%CI and Risk Ratio were 
      calculated using cross tabulation, Chi square test and multivariable logistic 
      regression analysis. Among 1514 total analyzed cohort (median age, 53 years [IQR, 
      17,106]; 43.7% from 46 to 65 years of age group, 56.2% males,33.4% with no 
      comorbid factor for disease progression) 369(24.4%) were vaccinated breakthrough 
      cases and 1145(75.6%) were unvaccinated controls. 556(36.7%) progressed to death 
      or mechanical ventilation, 958(63.3%) patients survived and were discharged home. 
      Disease progression to death or mechanical ventilation was significantly 
      associated with decreased likelihood of vaccination (24.9% among vaccinated 
      breakthrough vs 40.5% unvaccinated controls, [Absolute difference -15.6% 95%CI 
      (-10.2% to -20.6%); RR 0.615 95%CI (0.509, 0.744); p <.001]). This association 
      was stronger for old age population and for increase time span between second 
      dose of vaccine and onset of symptoms. There was no statistically significant 
      difference among different types of vaccination and occurrence of outcome when 
      compared to unvaccinated controls (RR 0.607(0.482, 0.763); 0.673(0.339, 1.33) and 
      0.623(0.441, 0.881) for Inactivated virus vaccine, mRNA and Adenovirus 
      vector-based vaccine respectively. The patients who were fully vaccinated against 
      SARS-COV-2 die or shift to mechanical ventilation less frequently than 
      unvaccinated COVID-19 admitted patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine induces both antibody and T-cell 
      immune responses and has been proven to be effective in preventing coronavirus 
      disease 2019, including its severe disease form, in healthy individuals. However, 
      the details of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 immunoglobulin-G 
      antibody responses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 specific 
      T-cell responses in patients with sarcoidosis are unknown. AIM: To measure and 
      compare antibody responses and T cell responses using enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assays and interferon-gamma release assay in sarcoidosis patients infected with 
      coronavirus disease 2019 and vaccinated with CoronaVac. STUDY DESIGN: A 
      prospective cohort study. METHODS: A total of 28 coronavirus disease 2019 
      polymerase chain reaction test-positive sarcoidosis patients who were infected 
      with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 in the past 6 months and did 
      not have coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination and 28 sarcoidosis patients who 
      were administered with 2 doses of CoronaVac and never had coronavirus disease 
      2019 were included in this study. The immune response levels of patients were 
      determined by measuring the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 
      immunglobulinG and interferon-gamma levels in the blood of the patients by the 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays method and interferon-gamma release assay 
      tests, respectively. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients in the COVID-infected 
      group was 48.1 ± 11.3, while the mean age of the patients in the vaccinated group 
      was 55.6 ± 9.32. The mean time elapsed after infection was 97.32 ± 42.1 days, 
      while 61.3 ± 28.7 days had passed since the second vaccination dose. In the 
      COVID-infected group, immunoglobulin-G and interferon-gamma release tests were 
      positive in 64.3% and 89.3% of the patients, respectively. In the vaccinated 
      group, immunoglobulin-G was positive in 10.7% of the patients, and 
      interferon-gamma release test was positive in 14.3%. CONCLUSION: Innate immune 
      responses are better than adaptive immune responses in patients with sarcoidosis. 
      The coronaVac vaccine is insufficient to generate humoral and cellular immunities 
      in patients with sarcoidosis.

AB  - In this single centre cohort study we assessed BNT162B2 vaccine uptake and 
      effectiveness among UK healthcare workers (HCWs) during a time of high community 
      COVID-19 prevalence. Early uptake among HCWs was 62.3% (1409/2260), however there 
      were significant differences in uptake between age groups, ethnic origins, and 
      job roles. Uptake increased to 72.9% after a vaccine hesitancy working group 
      implemented specific measures. In the 42 days after vaccination, 49 new cases of 
      COVID-19 were identified, of which 7 (14.3%) occurred in HCWs who were beyond 10 
      days of vaccination. Kaplan-Meier curves for partially vaccinated and 
      unvaccinated groups were congruent until day 14 and continued to diverge up to 42 
      days. Cox regression analysis showed a 70.0% (95%CI 6.0-91.0; p=0.04) risk 
      reduction for COVID-19 infection in partially vaccinated HCWs. Here we report 
      early vaccination rates among HCWs are generally high although uptake is lower in 
      certain groups. It is possible to improve vaccine uptake and efforts should focus 
      on this, however, significant resource is required. The BNT162B2 vaccine is 
      effective from 14 days post-vaccination in a frontline clinical setting and 
      protection continues beyond 21 days post 1st dose without a 2nd dose, being 
      given.

TI  - Protective Immunity of COVID-19 Vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Following 
      Previous SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Humoral and Cellular Investigation.
LID - 10.3390/v14091916 [doi]
LID - 1916
AB  - Infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 induce a severe acute respiratory syndrome called 
      COVID-19 and have led to more than six million deaths worldwide. Vaccination is 
      the most effective preventative measure, and cellular and humoral immunity is 
      crucial to developing individual protection. Here, we aim to investigate hybrid 
      immunity against SARS-CoV-2 triggered by the ChAadOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in a 
      Brazilian cohort. We investigated the immune response from ChAadOx1 nCoV-19 
      vaccination in naïve (noCOVID-19) and previously infected individuals (COVID-19) 
      by analyzing levels of D-dimers, total IgG, neutralizing antibodies (Nabs), IFN-γ 
      (interferon-γ) secretion, and immunophenotyping of memory lymphocytes. No 
      significant differences in D-dimer levels were observed 7 or 15 days after 
      vaccination (DAV). All vaccinated individuals presented higher levels of total 
      IgG or Nabs with a positive correlation (R = 0.88). Individuals in the COVID-19 
      group showed higher levels of antibody and memory B cells, with a faster antibody 
      response starting at 7 DAV compared to noCOVID-19 at 15 DAV. Further, ChAadOx1 
      nCoV-19 vaccination led to enhanced IFN-γ production (15 DAV) and an increase in 
      activated T CD4+ naïve cells in noCOVID-19 individuals in contrast with COVID-19 
      individuals. Hence, our data support that hybrid immunity triggered by ChAadOx1 
      nCoV-19 vaccination is associated with enhanced humoral response, together with a 
      balanced cellular response.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaccination is a key intervention to prevent COVID-19. Many vaccines 
      are administered globally, yet there is not much evidence regarding their safety 
      and adverse effects. Iran also faces this challenge, especially as data regarding 
      the Sputnik V vaccine is sparse. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine 
      the adverse effects of the most commonly used vaccines in Iran. METHODS: Using a 
      retrospective cohort study design, 6600 subjects aged 18 years or older who had 
      received two doses of any of the three COVID-19 vaccines (Sinopharm, AstraZeneca, 
      and Sputnik V) were selected using a random sampling method between March and 
      August 2021. Subjects were asked about any adverse effects of the vaccines by 
      trained interviewers via telephone interview. Vaccine-related adverse effects in 
      individuals during the first 72 h and subsequently following both doses of the 
      vaccines were determined. The demographic variables, type of administered 
      vaccine, adverse effects, and history of the previous infection with COVID-19 
      were collected. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) and analytical 
      statistics (Chi-squared and Wilcoxon tests) were performed at a 95% significance 
      level using STATA software version 15 (STATA Corp, College Station, TX, USA). 
      RESULTS: From 6600 participants, 4775 responded (response rate = 72.3%). Of the 
      participants, 1460 (30.6%) received the AstraZeneca vaccine, 1564 (32.8%) 
      received the Sinopharm vaccine and 1751 (36.7%) received the Sputnik V vaccine. 
      2653 participants (55.56%) reported adverse effects after the first dose and 1704 
      (35.7%) after the second dose. Sputnik V caused the most adverse effects with 
      1449 (82.7%) vaccine recipients reporting symptoms after the first or second 
      dose, compared with 1030 (70.5%) for AstraZeneca and only 585 (37.4%) for the 
      Sinopharm vaccine. The most common adverse effects after the first dose were 
      fatigue (28.37%), chill/fever (26.86%), and skeletal pain (22.38%). These three 
      adverse effects were the same for the second dose, although their prevalence was 
      lower. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrate that the Sputnik V vaccine has 
      the highest rate of adverse effects, followed by the AstraZeneca and Sinopharm 
      vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines used in Iran are safe and there were no reports of 
      serious adverse effects.

LID - 1036
AB  - Waning immunity following administration of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines remains 
      a concern for many health systems. We undertook a study to determine if recent 
      reports of waning for severe disease could have been attributed to design-related 
      bias by conducting a study only among those detected with a first SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. We used a matched case-control study design with the study base being 
      all individuals with first infection with SARS-CoV-2 reported in the State of 
      Qatar between 1 January 2021 and 20 February 2022. Cases were those detected with 
      first SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring intensive care (hard outcome), while 
      controls were those detected with first SARS-CoV-2 infection who recovered 
      without the need for intensive care. Cases and controls were matched in a 1:30 
      ratio for the calendar month of infection and the comorbidity category. Duration 
      and magnitude of conditional vaccine effectiveness against requiring intensive 
      care and the number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent one more case of 
      COVID-19 requiring intensive care was estimated for the mRNA (BNT162b2/mRNA-1273) 
      vaccines. Conditional vaccine effectiveness against requiring intensive care was 
      59% (95% confidence interval (CI), 50 to 76) between the first and second dose, 
      and strengthened to 89% (95% CI, 85 to 92) between the second dose and 4 months 
      post the second dose in persons who received a primary course of the vaccine. 
      There was no waning of vaccine effectiveness in the period from 4 to 6, 6 to 9, 
      and 9 to 12 months after the second dose. This study demonstrates that, contrary 
      to mainstream reports using hierarchical measures of effectiveness, conditional 
      vaccine effectiveness against requiring intensive care remains robust till at 
      least 12 months after the second dose of mRNA-based vaccines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The results of a randomised trial showed the safety and efficacy of 
      Gam-COVID-Vac against COVID-19. However, compared to other vaccines used across 
      the globe, the real-world data on the effectiveness of Gam-COVID-Vac, especially 
      against the disease caused by the Delta variant of concern, was limited. We aimed 
      to assess the effectiveness of vaccination mainly conducted with Gam-COVID-Vac in 
      St. Petersburg, Russia. METHODS: We designed a case-control study to assess the 
      vaccine effectiveness (VE) against referral to hospital. Self-reported 
      vaccination status was collected for individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 
      infection who were referred for initial low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) 
      triage in two outpatient centres in July 3-August 9, 2021, in St. Petersburg, 
      Russia. We used logistic regression models to estimate the adjusted (for age, 
      sex, and triage centre) VE for complete (14 days or more after the second dose) 
      vaccination. We estimated the VE against referral for hospital admission, 
      COVID-19-related lung injury assessed with LDCT, and decline in oxygen 
      saturation. RESULTS: In the final analysis, 13,893 patients were included, 1291 
      (9.3%) patients met our criteria for complete vaccination status, and 495 (3.6%) 
      were referred to hospital. In the primary analysis, the adjusted VE against 
      referral to hospital was 81% (95% confidence interval: 68-88) for complete 
      vaccination. The VE against referral to hospital was more pronounced in women 
      (84%, 95% CI: 66-92) compared to men (76%, 95% CI: 51-88). Vaccine protective 
      effect increased with increasing lung injury categories, from 54% (95% CI: 48-60) 
      against any sign of lung injury to 76% (95% CI: 59-86) against more than 50% lung 
      involvement. A sharp increase was observed in the probability of hospital 
      admission with age for non-vaccinated patients in relation to an almost flat 
      relationship for the completely vaccinated group. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 
      vaccination was effective against referral to hospital in patients with 
      symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in St. Petersburg, Russia. This protection is 
      probably mediated through VE against lung injury associated with COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Finland, both mRNA and adenovirus vector (AdV) Covid-19 vaccines 
      have been used after the vaccination campaign started on December 27, 2020. 
      Vaccination of the elderly and chronically ill was prioritized and the interval 
      between doses set to 12 weeks. The objective of this interim analysis was to 
      evaluate first and second dose vaccine effectiveness (VE) in a real-world 
      setting. METHODS: During the first five months of the campaign, a register-based 
      cohort study was conducted in the Finnish elderly aged 70+ years and those aged 
      16-69 years with medical conditions predisposing to severe Covid-19 (chronically 
      ill). Using Cox regression, VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection and Covid-19 
      hospitalisation was estimated comparing the hazard in the vaccinated with that in 
      the unvaccinated. RESULTS: The cohorts included 901092 elderly (89% vaccinated) 
      and 774526 chronically ill (69% vaccinated) individuals. Three weeks after the 
      first dose, mRNA VE against infection was 45% (95% confidence interval, 36-53%) 
      and 40% (26-51%) in elderly and chronically ill; mRNA VE against hospitalisation 
      was 63% (49-74%) and 82% (56-93%). In chronically ill, AdV VE was 42% (32-50) and 
      62% (42-75%) against infection and hospitalisation, respectively. One week after 
      the second dose, mRNA VE against infection was 75% (65-82%) and 77% (65-85%) in 
      elderly and chronically ill; mRNA VE against hospitalisation was 93% (70-98%) and 
      90% (29-99%). CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 vaccines protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      and Covid-19 hospitalisation. A single dose provides moderate protection in 
      elderly and chronically ill, although two doses are clearly superior.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The elderly are highly vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Waning immunity 
      and emergence of Omicron have caused concerns about reduced effectiveness of 
      COVID-19 vaccines. The objective was to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) 
      against severe COVID-19 among the elderly. METHODS: This nationwide, 
      register-based cohort analysis included all residents aged 70 years and over in 
      Finland. The follow-up started on December 27, 2020, and ended on March 31, 2022. 
      The outcomes of interest were COVID-19-related hospitalization and intensive care 
      unit (ICU) admission timely associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. VE was 
      estimated as one minus the hazard ratio comparing the vaccinated and unvaccinated 
      and taking into account time since vaccination. Omicron-specific VE was evaluated 
      as the effectiveness observed since January 1, 2022. RESULTS: The cohort included 
      896,220 individuals. Comirnaty (BioNTech/Pfizer) VE against COVID-19-related 
      hospitalization was 93% (95% CI 89-95%) and 85% (95% CI 82-87%) 14-90 and 
      91-180 days after the second dose; VE increased to 95% (95% CI 94-96%) 14-60 days 
      after the third dose. VE of other homologous and heterologous three dose series 
      was similar. Protection against severe COVID-19 requiring ICU treatment was even 
      better. Since January 1, 2022, Comirnaty VE was 98% (95% CI 92-99%) and 92% (95% 
      CI 87-95%) 14-90 and 91-180 days after the second and 98% (95% CI 95-99%) 
      14-60 days after the third dose. CONCLUSIONS: VE against severe COVID-19 is high 
      among the elderly. It waned slightly after two doses, but a third restored the 
      protection. VE against severe COVID-19 remained high even after the emergence of 
      Omicron.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Occupational disparities in COVID-19 vaccine uptake can impact the 
      effectiveness of vaccination programmes and introduce particular risk for 
      vulnerable workers and those with high workplace exposure. This study aimed to 
      investigate COVID-19 vaccine uptake by occupation, including for vulnerable 
      groups and by occupational exposure status. METHODS: We used data from employed 
      or self-employed adults who provided occupational information as part of the 
      Virus Watch prospective cohort study (n = 19,595) and linked this to 
      study-obtained information about vulnerability-relevant characteristics (age, 
      medical conditions, obesity status) and work-related COVID-19 exposure based on 
      the Job Exposure Matrix. Participant vaccination status for the first, second, 
      and third dose of any COVID-19 vaccine was obtained based on linkage to national 
      records and study records. We calculated proportions and Sison-Glaz multinomial 
      95% confidence intervals for vaccine uptake by occupation overall, by 
      vulnerability-relevant characteristics, and by job exposure. FINDINGS: 
      Vaccination uptake across occupations ranged from 89-96% for the first dose, 
      87-94% for the second dose, and 75-86% for the third dose, with transport, trade, 
      service and sales workers persistently demonstrating the lowest uptake. 
      Vulnerable workers tended to demonstrate fewer between-occupational differences 
      in uptake than non-vulnerable workers, although clinically vulnerable transport 
      workers (76%-89% across doses) had lower uptake than several other occupational 
      groups (maximum across doses 86%-96%). Workers with low SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk 
      had higher vaccine uptake (86%-96% across doses) than those with elevated or high 
      risk (81-94% across doses). INTERPRETATION: Differential vaccination uptake by 
      occupation, particularly amongst vulnerable and highly-exposed workers, is likely 
      to worsen occupational and related socioeconomic inequalities in infection 
      outcomes. Further investigation into occupational and non-occupational factors 
      influencing differential uptake is required to inform relevant interventions for 
      future COVID-19 booster rollouts and similar vaccination programmes.

LID - e2140364
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Little is known about the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine 
      adverse effects in a real-world population. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate factors 
      potentially associated with participant-reported adverse effects after COVID-19 
      vaccination. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The COVID-19 Citizen Science 
      Study, an online cohort study, includes adults aged 18 years and older with a 
      smartphone or internet access. Participants complete daily, weekly, and monthly 
      surveys on health and COVID-19-related events. This analysis includes 
      participants who provided consent between March 26, 2020, and May 19, 2021, and 
      received at least 1 COVID-19 vaccine dose. EXPOSURES: Participant-reported 
      COVID-19 vaccination. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Participant-reported adverse 
      effects and adverse effect severity. Candidate factors in multivariable logistic 
      regression models included age, sex, race, ethnicity, subjective social status, 
      prior COVID-19 infection, medical conditions, substance use, vaccine dose, and 
      vaccine brand. RESULTS: The 19 586 participants had a median (IQR) age of 54 
      (38-66) years, and 13 420 (68.8%) were women. Allergic reaction or anaphylaxis 
      was reported in 26 of 8680 participants (0.3%) after 1 dose of the BNT162b2 
      (Pfizer/BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine, 27 of 11 141 (0.2%) after 2 
      doses of the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine or 1 dose of the JNJ-78436735 (Johnson 
      & Johnson) vaccine. The strongest factors associated with adverse effects were 
      vaccine dose (2 doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 or 1 dose of JNJ-78436735 vs 1 
      dose of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273; odds ratio [OR], 3.10; 95% CI, 2.89-3.34; 
      P < .001), vaccine brand (mRNA-1273 vs BNT162b2, OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.86-2.15; 
      P < .001; JNJ-78436735 vs BNT162b2: OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52-0.79; P < .001), age 
      (per 10 years: OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.72-0.76; P < .001), female sex (OR, 1.65; 95% 
      CI, 1.53-1.78; P < .001), and having had COVID-19 before vaccination (OR, 2.17; 
      95% CI, 1.77-2.66; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this real-world 
      cohort, serious COVID-19 vaccine adverse effects were rare and comparisons across 
      brands could be made, revealing that full vaccination dose, vaccine brand, 
      younger age, female sex, and having had COVID-19 before vaccination were 
      associated with greater odds of adverse effects. Large digital cohort studies may 
      provide a mechanism for independent postmarket surveillance of drugs and devices.

TI  - COVID-19 vaccine uptake, effectiveness, and waning in 82,959 health care workers: 
      A national prospective cohort study in Wales.
PG  - 1180-1189

AB  - BACKGROUND: While population estimates suggest high vaccine effectiveness against 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, the protection for health care workers, who are at higher 
      risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, is less understood. METHODS: We conducted a national 
      cohort study of health care workers in Wales (UK) from 7 December 2020 to 30 
      September 2021. We examined uptake of any COVID-19 vaccine, and the effectiveness 
      of BNT162b2 mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech) against polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We used linked and routinely collected 
      national-scale data within the SAIL Databank. Data were available on 82,959 
      health care workers in Wales, with exposure extending to 26 weeks after second 
      doses. RESULTS: Overall vaccine uptake was high (90%), with most health care 
      workers receiving theBNT162b2 vaccine (79%). Vaccine uptake differed by age, 
      staff role, socioeconomic status; those aged 50-59 and 60+ years old were 1.6 
      times more likely to get vaccinated than those aged 16-29. Medical and dental 
      staff, and Allied Health Practitioners were 1.5 and 1.1 times more likely to get 
      vaccinated, compared to nursing and midwifery staff. The effectiveness of the 
      BNT162b2 vaccine was found to be strong and consistent across the characteristics 
      considered; 52% three to six weeks after first dose, 86% from two weeks after 
      second dose, though this declined to 53% from 22 weeks after the second dose. 
      CONCLUSIONS: With some variation in rate of uptake, those who were vaccinated had 
      a reduced risk of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to those 
      unvaccinated. Second dose has provided stronger protection for longer than first 
      dose but our study is consistent with waning from seven weeks onwards.

AB  - India approved COVID-19 vaccine called Covaxin, developed by the Indian Council 
      of Medical Research and Bharat Biotech Ltd. The primary objective of the study 
      was to estimate the effectiveness of Covaxin in preventing breakthrough 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs). A test-negative matched 
      case-control study was conducted among HCWs of tertiary care hospital in Eastern 
      India. Any HCW who tested positive for COVID-19 using RT-PCR during April and May 
      2021 was taken as the case. The HCWs who tested negative for COVID-19 by RT-PCR 
      were considered as controls after matching with the date of testing and 
      profession of the cases. Vaccination data were collected from the institution's 
      vaccine database and recall. In case of discrepancy, it was confirmed from the 
      CoWIN portal (cowin.gov.in). The sample size was 670 participants (335 pairs). 
      Conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate the adjusted odds 
      ratio for breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated 
      using the following formula: VE = (1-aOR) × 100%. Sensitivity analysis was done 
      for effectiveness of Covaxin, excluding Covishield vaccination. The mean age of 
      participants was 29.1 years (SD = 7.1), and the majority were males (55.2%). 
      Among the study participants, 60% were completely vaccinated, 18.51% were 
      partially vaccinated, and 21.49% were unvaccinated. After adjusting for age, 
      gender, type of household and past history of COVID-19 disease in conditional 
      logistic models, the vaccine effectiveness was 22% (aOR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.52-1.17; 
      p = .233). Sensitivity analysis with Covaxin showed an effectiveness of 29% (aOR 
      0.71, 95% CI: 0.47-1.08; p = .114) for preventing breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 
      infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a single dose of the 
      Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) in health-care workers in South Africa 
      during two waves of the South African COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: In the 
      single-arm, open-label, phase 3B implementation Sisonke study, health-care 
      workers aged 18 years and older were invited for vaccination at one of 122 
      vaccination sites nationally. Participants received a single dose of 5 × 10(10) 
      viral particles of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. Vaccinated participants were linked 
      with their person-level data from one of two national medical insurance schemes 
      (scheme A and scheme B) and matched for COVID-19 risk with an unvaccinated member 
      of the general population. The primary outcome was vaccine effectiveness against 
      severe COVID-19, defined as COVID-19-related admission to hospital, 
      hospitalisation requiring critical or intensive care, or death, in health-care 
      workers compared with the general population, ascertained 28 days or more after 
      vaccination or matching, up to data cutoff. This study is registered with the 
      South African National Clinical Trial Registry, DOH-27-022021-6844, 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04838795, and the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, 
      PACTR202102855526180, and is closed to accrual. FINDINGS: Between Feb 17 and May 
      17, 2021, 477 102 health-care workers were enrolled and vaccinated, of whom 
      357 401 (74·9%) were female and 119 701 (25·1%) were male, with a median age of 
      42·0 years (33·0-51·0). 215 813 vaccinated individuals were matched with 215 813 
      unvaccinated individuals. As of data cutoff (July 17, 2021), vaccine 
      effectiveness derived from the total matched cohort was 83% (95% CI 75-89) to 
      prevent COVID-19-related deaths, 75% (69-82) to prevent COVID-19-related hospital 
      admissions requiring critical or intensive care, and 67% (62-71) to prevent 
      COVID-19-related hospitalisations. The vaccine effectiveness for all three 
      outcomes were consistent across scheme A and scheme B. The vaccine effectiveness 
      was maintained in older health-care workers and those with comorbidities 
      including HIV infection. During the course of the study, the beta (B.1.351) and 
      then the delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns were dominant, and 
      vaccine effectiveness remained consistent (for scheme A plus B vaccine 
      effectiveness against COVID-19-related hospital admission during beta wave was 
      62% [95% CI 42-76] and during delta wave was 67% [62-71], and vaccine 
      effectiveness against COVID-19-related death during beta wave was 86% [57-100] 
      and during delta wave was 82% [74-89]). INTERPRETATION: The single-dose 
      Ad26.COV2.S vaccine shows effectiveness against severe COVID-19 disease and 
      COVID-19-related death after vaccination, and against both beta and delta 
      variants, providing real-world evidence for its use globally. FUNDING: National

AB  - BACKGROUND: We provide national estimates of the real-world Vaccine effectiveness 
      (VE) based on nationally available surveillance data. The study aimed to estimate 
      the effectiveness of the inactivated Covid-19 vaccine BBIBP-CorV (Vero Cells) 
      Sinopharm vaccine currently deployed in Morocco against SARS- CoV-2 severe 
      disease/ hospitalization" within 9 months after vaccination. METHODS: We 
      conducted a test-negative, case-control study among a population aged 18 years or 
      older who were tested by rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection from February to October 
      2021 in Morocco. From the national laboratory COVID-19 database; we identified 
      cases who were rt-PCR positive amongst severe and critical COVID-19 cases and 
      controls who had a negative rt-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. From the national 
      vaccination register (NVR); individuals vaccinated with COVID-19 Vaccine (Vero 
      Cell) and those unvaccinated were identified and included in the study. The 
      linkage between databases was conducted for the study of Vaccination status based 
      on the timing of the vaccine receipt relative to the SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR test date. 
      For each person, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, we identified a propensity 
      score-matched control participant who was tested negative. We estimated vaccine 
      effectiveness against SARS- CoV-2 severe disease/ hospitalization using 
      conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 12884 persons who tested positive 
      and 12885 propensity score-matched control participants, the median age was 62 
      years, 47.2% of whom were female. As a function of time after vaccination of 
      second dose vaccination, vaccine effectiveness during the first month was 88% 
      (95% CI, 84-91), 87% (95% CI: 83-90) during the second and third month, 75% (95% 
      CI: 67-80) during the fourth month, 61% (95% CI: 54-67) during the fifth month, 
      and 64% (95% CI: 59-69) beyond the sixth month. VE remained high and stable 
      during the first three months in the two-age subgroup. In the fourth month, the 
      VE in the older population aged 60 years and above (64%) was reduced by 20 points 
      compared to VE in the younger population (84%). CONCLUSION: A Sinopharm vaccine 
      is highly protective against serious SARS-CoV-2 infection under real-world 
      conditions. Protection remained high and stable during the first three months 
      following the second dose and decreases slightly beyond the fourth month 
      especially beyond 60 years.

TI  - The Impact of Vaccination on Incidence and Outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in 
      Patients with Kidney Failure in Scotland.
PG  - 677-686
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2022010046 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with kidney failure requiring KRT are at high risk of 
      complications and death following SARS-CoV-2 infection, with variable antibody 
      responses to vaccination reported. We investigated the effects of COVID-19 
      vaccination on the incidence of infection, hospitalization, and death from 
      COVID-19 infection. METHODS: The study design was an observational data linkage 
      cohort study. Multiple health care datasets were linked to ascertain all 
      SARS-CoV-2 testing, vaccination, hospitalization, and mortality data for all 
      patients treated with KRT in Scotland from the start of the pandemic over a 
      period of 20 months. Descriptive statistics, survival analyses, and vaccine 
      effectiveness were calculated. RESULTS: As of September 19, 2021, 93% (n=5281) of 
      the established KRT population in Scotland had received two doses of an approved 
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Over the study period, there were 814 cases of SARS-CoV-2 
      infection (15.1% of the KRT population). Vaccine effectiveness rates against 
      infection and hospitalization were 33% (95% CI, 0 to 52) and 38% (95% CI, 0 to 
      57), respectively. Within 28 days of a SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR test, 9.2% of 
      fully vaccinated individuals died (7% patients on dialysis and 10% kidney 
      transplant recipients). This compares to <0.1% of the vaccinated general Scottish 
      population admitted to the hospital or dying due to COVID-19 during that period. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that a primary vaccine course of two doses 
      has limited effect on COVID-19 infection and its complications in patients with 
      KRT. Adjunctive strategies to reduce risk of both COVID-19 infection and its 
      complications in this population are urgently required.

AB  - Despite the fact that COVID-19 vaccines serve as an important tool for protection 
      against COVID-19 infection, in individuals aged above 65 years, as well as the 
      entire community, there are significant problems associated with getting 
      vaccinated. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of perceptions and 
      attitudes toward the COVID-19 epidemic in individuals over the age of 65 living 
      in Şanlıurfa, Turkey in 2021, on the situation of having COVID-19 vaccination. 
      The study is designed as a case-control type of research. The study population 
      was comprised of individuals aged 65 years and above located in Şanlıurfa, 
      Turkey. The Case Group consisted of individuals, who rejected the COVID-19 
      vaccination and the Control Group consisted of individuals who have received the 
      vaccine. The individuals recruited in the Case and Control Groups were selected 
      by means of the snowball sampling method. The study included a total of 240 
      individuals including 120 in the Case Group and 120 in the Control Group. Rate of 
      vaccine rejection was higher in individuals who believed that the media 
      exaggerated the pandemic, the disease had low contagiousness, the pandemic was a 
      conspiracy, the environmental pollution had no role in the disease, the domestic 
      measures taken against the epidemic were inadequate, the personal hygiene could 
      not protect from disease, and who did not believe that the disease was inevitable 
      [p < 0.05]. Governments have a lot of responsibilities in providing accurate 
      information about vaccination to people and increasing confidence in the health 
      system.

AB  - Vaccination against SARS-CoV2 represents a key weapon to prevent COVID-19, but 
      lower response rates to vaccination have frequently been reported in solid organ 
      transplant recipients. The aim of our study was to evaluate the rate of 
      seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in a cohort of kidney transplant 
      recipients and the potential role of the different immunosuppressive regimens. We 
      conducted an observational retrospective cohort study in kidney transplant 
      patients vaccinated for COVID-19. For each patient, we evaluated IgG anti-S-RBD 
      SARS-CoV-2 titers immediately before the administration of first COVID-19 
      vaccination dose, 20 days after the first dose and 40 days after the second dose. 
      Moreover, we evaluated the type of immunosuppressive treatment and the incidence 
      of vaccine breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. We enrolled 121 kidney transplant 
      patients vaccinated for COVID-19. At the time of administration of the first 
      vaccine dose, all patients had a negative antibody titer; only 4.1% had positive 
      antibody titers 20 days after the first dose. More than half patients 62 (51%) 
      had protective antibody titers 40 days after the second dose. A total of 18 Solid 
      Organ Transplant Recipients (SOTRs) (14.9%) got a SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough 
      infection during the study period. With regard to immunosuppressive regimen, 
      patients on mycophenolate-based regimen (48.7%) showed the lowest antibody 
      response rates (27.5%) compared to other regimens. Our study confirms that kidney 
      transplant patients show a poor response to two doses of COVID-19 vaccination. 
      Moreover, in our study the use of mycophenolate is significantly associated with 
      a non-response to COVID-19 m-RNA vaccines.

AB  - To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, a mass vaccination campaign was initiated in 
      Italy on 27 December 2020. The vaccine available to immunize Italian healthcare 
      workers (HCWs) was the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty). This study 
      evaluated the effectiveness of the vaccine against documented SARS-CoV-2 
      infection and symptomatic diseases in the medium- to long-term. HCWs at Bari 
      Policlinico University-Hospital (Italy) who completed the vaccination schedule 
      were matched with HCWs who had refused vaccination; the two groups were 
      followed-up for 5 months (January-May 2021). Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against 
      infection was 97.7% (95.4-99.0%) at 14-34 days after the first dose, and 94.8% 
      (87.0-97.8%), 83.0% (65.0-92.0%), and 81.0% (42.0-94.0%) at 14-41, 42-69, and >69 
      days, respectively, after the second dose. The estimated VE for documented 
      symptomatic disease was 99.2% (96.4-99.8%) at 14-34 days after the first dose and 
      97.2% (90.3-99.2%), 85.0% (63.0-94.2%), and 88.0% (42.0-97.6%) at 14-41, 42-69, 
      and >69 days, respectively, after the second dose. Efforts to increase 
      vaccination rates should be strengthened, including mandatory vaccination for 
      HCWs and greater incentives to increase vaccine acceptance by the general 
      population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The appearance of very contagious SARS-CoV-2 variants and waning 
      vaccine immunity may indicate the need to return to using universal methods of 
      preventing the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a multicenter 
      retrospective cohort survey study to describe the methods used in dialysis units 
      to prevent and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and also the association between 
      these methods and the incidence of COVID-19 among hemodialyzed (HD) patients 
      before the era of vaccination. The study population included all maintenance HD 
      patients (n = 1569) in 14 dialysis units in the Pomeranian Voivodeship. RESULTS: 
      The group of 352 patients (199 men, 153 female) were confirmed for COVID-19. The 
      absolute cumulative incidence in the studied period was 22.4%. It varied widely 
      by dialysis units, ranging from 9.4% to 36.9%. Universal preventive methods were 
      applied by all units. Different additional methods were implemented in some 
      stations with varying frequency (36-86%). In order to quantify the scale of the 
      applied additional preventive methods, we calculated a summary prevention index 
      (PI), i.e., one point for one additional method. Lower incidence was found in 
      centers applying dialysis in isolation of patients hospitalized due to diseases 
      requiring hospitalization (17.42% ± 6.89 vs. 26.54 ± 6.34; p = 0.028) and higher 
      incidence in medium-size dialysis centers (ANOVA F: p = 0.017). Significant 
      inverse correlation between PI and incidence was demonstrated as well (r = 
      -0.759; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The higher the number of implemented preventive 
      measures, the lower the risk of COVID-19 infection in HD patients. Among applied 
      procedures the isolation of hospitalized patients is of significant importance. 
      The measures proved to be effective in prevention before the vaccination era 
      should be continued, as the threat of SARS-CoV-2 still exists.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 needs to be assessed in 
      diverse real-world population settings. METHODS: A cohort study of 805,741 
      residents in Skåne county, Southern Sweden, aged 18-64 years, of whom 26,587 
      received at least one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Incidence rates of COVID-19 
      were estimated in sex- and age-adjusted analysis and stratified in two-week 
      periods with substantial community spread of the disease. RESULTS: The estimated 
      vaccine effectiveness in preventing infection ≥7 days after second dose was 86% 
      (95% CI 72-94%) but only 42% (95% CI 14-63%) ≥14 days after a single dose. No 
      difference in vaccine effectiveness was observed between females and males. 
      Having a prior positive test was associated with 91% (95% CI 85-94%) 
      effectiveness against new infection among the unvaccinated. CONCLUSION: A 
      satisfactory effectiveness of BNT162b2 after the second dose was suggested, but 
      with possibly substantially lower effect before the second dose.

AB  - The extensive register infrastructure available for coronavirus disease 2019 
      surveillance in Scania county, Sweden, makes it possible to classify individual 
      cases with respect to hospitalisation and disease severity, stratify on time 
      since last dose and demographic factors, account for prior infection and extract 
      data for population controls automatically. In the present study, we developed a 
      case–control sampling design to surveil vaccine effectiveness (VE) in this 
      ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population with more than 1.3 million 
      inhabitants. The first surveillance results show that estimated VE against 
      hospitalisation and severe disease 0–3 months after the last dose remained stable 
      during the study period, but waned markedly 6 months after the last dose in 
      persons aged 65 years or over.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: During December 2020, a massive vaccination program was introduced in 
      our country. The Pfizer-BioNTech, BNT162b2 vaccine was first offered exclusively 
      to high-risk population, such as medical personnel (including pregnant women). In 
      this study we compare short term outcomes in vaccinated vs. non-vaccinated 
      pregnant women. METHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study, 
      vaccinated and non-vaccinated pregnant women were recruited using an online 
      Google forms questionnaire targeting medical groups on Facebook and WhatsApp. A 
      second questionnaire was sent one month after the first one for interim analysis. 
      Our primary outcome was composite complications in vaccinated and non-vaccinated 
      groups, considered any of the following: vaginal bleeding, pregnancy loss, 
      hypertension, gestational diabetes, and preterm birth. Secondary outcomes 
      included: vaccine side effects, diagnosis of COVID-19 since the last 
      questionnaire, prevalence of vaccinated participants, and reasons for refusal to 
      be vaccinated. RESULTS: Overall, 432 women answered the first questionnaire, of 
      which 326 responses were received to the second questionnaire. Vaccination rate 
      increased from 25.5% to 62% within a month. Maternal age, gestational age at 
      enrollment, nulliparity and number of children were similar in both groups. The 
      rate of composite pregnancy complications was similar between vaccinated and 
      non-vaccinated group (15.8% vs 20.1%, p = 0.37), respectively. The risk for 
      COVID-19 infection was significantly lower in the vaccinated group (1.5% vs 6.5%, 
      p = 0.024, Odds Ratio: 4.5, 95% confidence interval 1.19-17.6). CONCLUSIONS: mRNA 
      vaccine during pregnancy does not seem to increase the rate of pregnancy 
      complications and is effective in prevention of COVID-19 infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 vaccines, face masks, and social distancing are 
      effective interventions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. In this study, we aimed 
      to determine lung cancer patients' attitudes toward vaccination, changes in 
      behavior after vaccination, and willingness to continue mask wearing after the 
      pandemic. METHODS: We sent out questionnaires to 220 thoracic oncology patients 
      treated at our lung cancer center in May 2021. The questionnaire focused on 
      patients' vaccination status, self-reported experiences surrounding vaccination, 
      and assessed changes in behaviors before and after vaccination as well as 
      opinions toward mask wearing after the pandemic. Results are presented as 
      absolute and relative frequencies and means with standard deviation and compared 
      using t test, paired t test, and analysis of variance test as well as chi(2) 
      test, and Fisher exact text. RESULTS: About 91.0% of patients reported having 
      received at least 1 vaccination. About 73.3% of patients reported having at least 
      1 reaction to the vaccination. The most common reactions were pain at the 
      injection site, fatigue, and headache. After vaccination, patients increased 
      contact with family and friends, use of public transport, and grocery shopping. 
      Overall, the level of willingness to wear masks beyond the end of the pandemic 
      differed according to vaccination status. CONCLUSIONS: Acceptance of the COVID-19 
      vaccination among thoracic oncology patients in Germany was high. Overall, 
      patients with thoracic malignancies tolerated the COVID-19 vaccination well. Rate 
      of adverse reaction was not higher compared with the general population. After 
      the vaccination, patients increased social contacts and usage of public 
      transport. These changes suggest positive psychological effects on quality of 
      life. While reducing social distancing can increase the risk of infection, our 
      results indicate that an extension of mask mandates after the pandemic would 
      likely be accepted by a majority of thoracic oncology patients, suggesting that 
      our cohort was still aware and in support of other measure of protection.

AB  - Clinical trials and real-world evidence on COVID-19 vaccines have shown their 
      effectiveness against severe disease and death but the durability of protection 
      remains unknown. We analysed the humoral and T-cell immune responses in 110 
      healthcare workers (HCWs) vaccinated according to the manufacturer's recommended 
      schedule of dose 2 three weeks after dose 1 from a prospective on-going cohort in 
      early 2021, 3 and 6 months after full vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. 
      Anti-RBD IgG titres were lower in HCWs over 60 years old 3 months after the 
      second dose (p=0.03) and declined in all the subjects between 3 and 6 months with 
      a median percentage change of -58.5%, irrespective of age and baseline 
      comorbidities. Specific T-cell response measured by IGRA declined over time by at 
      least 42% (median) in 91 HCWs and increased by 33% (median) in 17 others. Six 
      HCWs had a negative T-cell response at 6 months. Ongoing follow-up should provide 
      correlates of long-term protection according to the different immune response 
      profiles observed. COVIDIM study was registered under the number NCT04896788 on 
      clinicaltrials.gov.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of the 
      Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine among 
      pregnant women compared with non-pregnant women, and to evaluate obstetric 
      outcome following vaccination. METHODS: This was an observational case-control 
      study of pregnant women who were vaccinated with a two-dose regimen of the 
      BNT162b2 vaccine during gestation between January and February 2021 (study group) 
      and age-matched non-pregnant women who received the vaccine during the same time 
      period (control group). Participants received a digital questionnaire 1-4 weeks 
      after the second dose and were asked to provide information regarding 
      demographics, medication, medical history, history of severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, timing of COVID-19 vaccine doses 
      and side effects after each vaccine dose. A second digital questionnaire, 
      regarding current pregnancy and delivery outcomes, was sent to patients in the 
      study group after the calculated due date. All recruited women were offered a 
      serology blood test for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) following the second 
      vaccination dose and SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were compared between the two groups. 
      RESULTS: Of 539 pregnant women who were recruited after completion of the 
      two-dose regimen of the vaccine, 390 returned the digital questionnaire and were 
      included in the study group and compared to 260 age-matched non-pregnant 
      vaccinated women. The rates of rash, fever and severe fatigue following 
      vaccination among pregnant women were comparable to those in non-pregnant women. 
      Myalgia, arthralgia and headache were significantly less common among pregnant 
      women after each dose, local pain or swelling and axillary lymphadenopathy were 
      significantly less common among pregnant women after the first and second doses, 
      respectively, while paresthesia was significantly more common among the pregnant 
      population after the second dose. Among pregnant women, there were no significant 
      differences in the rates of side effects according to whether the vaccine was 
      administered during the first, second or third trimester of pregnancy, except for 
      local pain/swelling, which was significantly less common after the first dose 
      when administered during the third trimester, and uterine contractions, which 
      were significantly more common after the second dose when administered during the 
      third trimester. The rates of obstetric complications, including uterine 
      contractions (1.3% after the first dose and 6.4% after the second dose), vaginal 
      bleeding (0.3% after the first dose and 1.5% after the second dose) and prelabor 
      rupture of membranes (0% after the first dose and 0.8% after the second dose), 
      were very low following vaccination. All serum samples in both groups were 
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. However, pregnant women had significantly lower 
      serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels compared to non-pregnant women (signal-to-cut-off 
      ratio, 27.03 vs 34.35, respectively; P < 0.001). Among the 57 pregnant women who 
      delivered during the study period and who completed the second questionnaire, 
      median gestational age at delivery was 39.5 (interquartile range, 38.7-40.0) 
      weeks, with no cases of preterm birth < 37 weeks, no cases of fetal or neonatal 
      death and two (3.5%) cases of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit for 
      respiratory support. CONCLUSIONS: The adverse-effect profile and short-term 
      obstetric and neonatal outcomes among pregnant women who were vaccinated with the 
      BNT162b2 vaccine at any stage of pregnancy do not indicate any safety concerns. 
      The vaccine is effective in generating a humoral immune response in pregnant 
      women, although SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were lower than those observed in 
      non-pregnant vaccinated women. © 2021 International Society of Ultrasound in

TI  - Long-term efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease, on dialysis or after kidney transplantation: a national 
      prospective observational cohort study.
PG  - 55

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages G4-G5, on dialysis or after 
      kidney transplantation (kidney replacement therapy, KRT). SARS-CoV-2 vaccine 
      trials do not elucidate if SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is effective in these patients. 
      Vaccination against other viruses is known to be less effective in kidney 
      patients. Our objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of various types of 
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations in patients with CKD stages G4-G5 or on KRT. METHODS: In 
      this national prospective observational cohort study we will follow patients with 
      CKD stages G4-G5 or on KRT (n = 12,000) after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination according to 
      the Dutch vaccination program. Blood will be drawn for antibody response 
      measurements at day 28 and month 6 after completion of vaccination. Patient 
      characteristics and outcomes will be extracted from registration data and 
      questionnaires during 2 years of follow-up. Results will be compared with a 
      control group of non-vaccinated patients. The level of antibody response to 
      vaccination will be assessed in subgroups to predict protection against COVID-19 
      breakthrough infection. RESULTS: The primary endpoint is efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 
      vaccination determined as the incidence of COVID-19 after vaccination. Secondary 
      endpoints are the antibody based immune response at 28 days after vaccination, 
      the durability of this response at 6 months after vaccination, mortality and 
      (serious) adverse events. CONCLUSION: This study will fulfil the lack of 
      knowledge on efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with CKD 
      stages G4-G5 or on KRT. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study protocol has been 
      registered in clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT04841785 ). Current knowledge about this 
      subject COVID-19 has devastating impact on patients with CKD stages G4-G5, on 
      dialysis or after kidney transplantation. Effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is 
      very important in these vulnerable patient groups. Recent studies on vaccination 
      in these patient groups are small short-term studies with surrogate endpoints. 
      Contribution of this study Assessment of incidence and course of COVID-19 after 
      various types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination during a two-year follow-up period in not 
      only patients on dialysis or kidney transplant recipients, but also in patients 
      with CKD stages G4-G5. Quantitative analysis of antibody response after 
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and its relationship with incidence and course of COVID-19 
      in patients with CKD stages G4-G5, on dialysis or after kidney transplantation 
      compared with a control group. Monitoring of (serious) adverse events and 
      development of anti-HLA antibodies. Impact on practice or policy Publication of 
      the study design contributes to harmonization of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine study 
      methodology in kidney patients at high-risk for severe COVID-19. Data on efficacy 
      of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with CKD will provide guidance for future 
      vaccination policy.

AB  - Aims: An observational study of a retrospective cohort was performed to assess 
      the impact of influenza vaccination (IV) on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 
      population of middle-aged people for 8 weeks after IV and compared with an 
      unvaccinated group.Patients and methods: Data from 1098 middle-aged patients 
      (53.7 ± 4.7 years) after IV and 1205 unvaccinated patients (50.1 ± 6.8 years) 
      were analyzed based on medical documentation. The inclusion criteria were age 
      between 40 - 60 years and IV in the period from 1-30 September 2020. The 
      incidence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by PCR and the 
      classification of ICD-10 (U07.1).Results and conclusions: After IV, patients had 
      significantly fewer SARS-CoV-2 infections than the unvaccinated patients (P 
      = .017). The hazard ratio was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.54-0.89). IV may partially reduce 
      the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - In this longitudinal cohort study, we assessed the severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroconversion rates and analyzed the 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine-induced immunity of 872 hospital 
      workers at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf between May 11 and May 
      31, 2021. The overall seroprevalence of anti-NC-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 4.7% 
      (n = 41), indicating low SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and persistent effectiveness 
      of hospital-wide infection control interventions during the second and third wave 
      of the pandemic. In total, 92.7% (n = 808) out of the entire study cohort, 98.2% 
      (n = 325) of those who had been vaccinated once and all 393 individuals who had 
      been vaccinated twice had detectable anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and 
      no significant differences in vaccine-induced immune response were detected 
      between male and female individuals and between different age groups. Vaccinated 
      study participants with detectable anti-NC-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers (n = 30) 
      developed generally higher anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers compared to 
      anti-NC-SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals (n = 694) (median titer: 7812 vs. 345 
      BAU/ml, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, study participants who received heterologous 
      vaccination with AZD1222 followed by an mRNA vaccine showed markedly higher 
      anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers than individuals who received two doses of 
      an mRNA vaccine or two doses of AZD1222 (median titer: AZD1222/AZD1222: 1069 
      BAU/ml, mRNA/mRNA: 1388 BAU/ml, AZD1222/mRNA: 9450 BAU/ml; p < 0.0001). Our 
      results indicate that infection control interventions were generally effective in 
      preventing nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and that COVID-19 vaccines can 
      elicit strong humoral responses in the majority of a real-world cohort of 
      hospital workers.

TI  - Association of COVID-19 Vaccination With Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection by Time 
      Since Vaccination and Delta Variant Predominance.
PG  - 1032-1041
LID - 10.1001/jama.2022.2068 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Monitoring COVID-19 vaccine performance over time since vaccination 
      and against emerging variants informs control measures and vaccine policies. 
      OBJECTIVE: To estimate the associations between symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      and receipt of BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and Ad26.COV2.S by day since vaccination 
      before and during Delta variant predominance (pre-Delta period: March 13-May 29, 
      2021; Delta period: July 18-October 17, 2021). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      Test-negative, case-control design with data from 6884 US COVID-19 testing sites 
      in the pharmacy-based Increasing Community Access to Testing platform. This study 
      included 1 634 271 laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests 
      (NAATs) from adults 20 years and older and 180 112 NAATs from adolescents 12 to 
      19 years old with COVID-19-like illness from March 13 to October 17, 2021. 
      EXPOSURES: COVID-19 vaccination (1 Ad26.COV2.S dose or 2 mRNA doses) 14 or more 
      days prior. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Association between symptomatic infection 
      and prior vaccination measured using the odds ratio (OR) from spline-based 
      multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: The analysis included 390 762 
      test-positive cases (21.5%) and 1 423 621 test-negative controls (78.5%) (59.9% 
      were 20-44 years old; 9.9% were 12-19 years old; 58.9% were female; 71.8% were 
      White). Among adults 20 years and older, the BNT162b2 mean OR for days 14 to 60 
      after a second dose (initial OR) was lower during the pre-Delta period (0.10 [95% 
      CI, 0.09-0.11]) than during the Delta period (0.16 [95% CI, 0.16-0.17]) and 
      increased with time since vaccination (per-month change in OR, pre-Delta: 0.04 
      [95% CI, 0.02-0.05]; Delta: 0.03 [95% CI, 0.02-0.03]). The initial mRNA-1273 OR 
      was 0.05 (95% CI, 0.04-0.05) during the pre-Delta period, 0.10 (95% CI, 
      0.10-0.11) during the Delta period, and increased with time (per-month change in 
      OR, pre-Delta: 0.02 [95% CI, 0.005-0.03]; Delta: 0.03 [95% CI, 0.03-0.04]). The 
      Ad26.COV2.S initial OR was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.37-0.47) during the pre-Delta period 
      and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.58-0.65) during the Delta period and did not significantly 
      increase with time since vaccination. Among adolescents, the BNT162b2 initial OR 
      during the Delta period was 0.06 (95% CI, 0.05-0.06) among 12- to 15-year-olds, 
      increasing by 0.02 (95% CI, 0.01-0.03) per month, and 0.10 (95% CI, 0.09-0.11) 
      among 16- to 19-year-olds, increasing by 0.04 (95% CI, 0.03-0.06) per month. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults, the OR for the association between 
      symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination (as an estimate of 
      vaccine effectiveness) was higher during Delta variant predominance, suggesting 
      lower protection. For mRNA vaccination, the steady increase in OR by month since 
      vaccination was consistent with attenuation of estimated effectiveness over time; 
      attenuation related to time was greater than that related to variant.

TI  - BNT162b2 vaccine breakthrough: clinical characteristics of 152 fully vaccinated 
      hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Israel.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have shown high 
      effectiveness in the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19, hospitalization, severe 
      disease and death. Nevertheless, a minority of vaccinated individuals might 
      become infected and experience significant morbidity. Characteristics of vaccine 
      breakthrough infections have not been studied. We sought to portray the 
      population of Israeli patients, who were hospitalized with COVID-19 despite full 
      vaccination. METHODS: A retrospective multicentre cohort study of 17 hospitals 
      included patients fully vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2 vaccine who 
      developed COVID-19 more than 7 days after the second vaccine dose and required 
      hospitalization. The risk for poor outcome, defined as a composite of mechanical 
      ventilation or death, was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 152 patients were 
      included, accounting for half of hospitalized fully vaccinated patients in 
      Israel. Poor outcome was noted in 38 patients and mortality rate reached 22% 
      (34/152). Notably, the cohort was characterized by a high rate of co-morbidities 
      predisposing to severe COVID-19, including hypertension (108; 71%), diabetes (73; 
      48%), congestive heart failure (41; 27%), chronic kidney and lung diseases (37; 
      24% each), dementia (29; 19%) and cancer (36; 24%), and only six (4%) had no 
      co-morbidities. Sixty (40%) of the patients were immunocompromised. Higher viral 
      load was associated with a significant risk for poor outcome. Risk also appeared 
      higher in patients receiving anti-CD20 treatment and in patients with low titres 
      of anti-Spike IgG, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We found that severe COVID-19 infection, associated with a high 
      mortality rate, might develop in a minority of fully vaccinated individuals with 
      multiple co-morbidities. Our patients had a higher rate of co-morbidities and 
      immunosuppression compared with previously reported non-vaccinated hospitalized 
      individuals with COVID-19. Further characterization of this vulnerable population 
      may help to develop guidance to augment their protection, either by continued 
      social distancing, or by additional active or passive vaccinations.

      patients (VD; Jun-Aug 2021) and unvaccinated cases during the Delta wave (ND) and 
      breakthrough infections during an earlier Alpha wave (VA; Jan-Apr 2021). Primary 
      outcome was death or ventilation.ResultsWe included 343 VD, 162 ND and 172 VA 
      patients. VD were more likely older (OR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.05-1.08), men (OR: 1.6; 
      95% CI: 1.0-2.5) and immunosuppressed (OR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.1-5.5) vs ND. Median 
      time between second vaccine dose and admission was 179 days (IQR: 166-187) in VD 
      vs 41 days (IQR: 28-57.5) in VA. VD patients were less likely to be men (OR: 0.6; 
      95% CI: 0.4-0.9), immunosuppressed (OR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.2-0.5) or have congestive 
      heart failure (OR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.3-0.9) vs VA. The outcome was similar between 
      all cohorts and affected by age and immunosuppression and not by vaccination, 
      variant or time from vaccination.ConclusionsVaccination was protective during the 
      Delta variant wave, as suggested by older age and greater immunosuppression in 
      vaccinated breakthrough vs unvaccinated inpatients. Nevertheless, compared with 
      an earlier post-vaccination period, breakthrough infections 6 months 
      post-vaccination occurred in healthier patients. Thus, waning immunity increased 
      vulnerability during the Delta wave, which suggests boosters as a countermeasure.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) antigen or RNA in respiratory specimens ≥14 days after 
      administration of all recommended doses of authorized coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) vaccines is defined as breakthrough infection. In the present 
      investigation, mRNA and vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were analysed with 
      respect to postvaccination infections in vaccinated hospital employees. METHODS: 
      A total of 8553 staff members were vaccinated with BNT162b2 (47%) or ChAdOx1-S 
      (53%) between January and May 2021. In a retrospective observational cohort 
      study, incidence of SARS-CoV-2 postvaccination infections was analysed in 
      relation to demographic data, viral load, virus variants, vaccine brand and 
      vaccination status at time of positive PCR test (fully vaccinated: ≥14 days since 
      second dose; partially vaccinated: >21 days since first, but <14 days after 
      second dose; insufficiently vaccinated: <22 days since first dose). RESULTS: 
      Within the follow-up period, ending on 31 July 2021, person-time at risk-adjusted 
      monthly rates for SARS-CoV-2 postvaccination infections were 0.18% (BNT162b2) and 
      0.57% (ChAdOx1-S) for insufficiently vaccinated, 0.34% (BNT162b2) and 0.32% 
      (ChAdOx1-S) for partially vaccinated and 0.06% (BNT162b2) and 0.04% (ChAdOx1-S) 
      for fully vaccinated participants. The two vaccine types did not differ with 
      respect to hazard ratios for any of the respective postvaccination infection 
      types. No cases of COVID-19-related hospitalizations or deaths were reported. 
      Genotyping of positive PCR specimens revealed 42 variants of concern: B.1.1.7 
      (Alpha variant; n = 34); B.1.351 (Beta variant; n = 2), B.1.617.2 (Delta variant; 
      n = 6). CONCLUSIONS: BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1-S are both effective in preventing 
      breakthrough infections; however, it seems important, that all recommended 
      vaccine doses are administered.

TI  - Real-world effectiveness of the mRNA-1273 vaccine against COVID-19: Interim 
      results from a prospective observational cohort study.
PG  - 100134

AB  - BACKGROUND: Phase 3 trials found mRNA-1273 was highly effective in preventing 
      COVID-19. We conducted a prospective cohort study at Kaiser Permanente Southern 
      California (KPSC) to determine the real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 
      mRNA-1273 in preventing COVID-19 infection and severe disease. METHODS: For this 
      planned interim analysis, individuals aged ≥18 years receiving 2 doses of 
      mRNA-1273 ≥24 days apart (18/12/2020-31/03/2021) were 1:1 matched to randomly 
      selected unvaccinated individuals by age, sex, and race/ethnicity, with follow-up 
      through 30/06/2021. Outcomes were COVID-19 infection (SARS-CoV-2 positive 
      molecular test or COVID-19 diagnosis code) or severe disease (COVID-19 
      hospitalization and COVID-19 hospital death). Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 
      confidence intervals (CI) for COVID-19 outcomes comparing vaccinated and 
      unvaccinated individuals were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models 
      accounting for multiple comparisons. Adjusted VE was calculated as (1-aHR)x100. 
      Whole genome sequencing was performed on SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens from the 
      KPSC population. FINDINGS: This analysis included 352,878 recipients of 2 doses 
      of mRNA-1273 matched to 352,878 unvaccinated individuals. VE (99·3% CI) against 
      COVID-19 infection was 87·4% (84·8-89·6%). VE against COVID-19 hospitalization 
      and hospital death was 95·8% (90·7-98·1%) and 97·9% (66·9-99·9%), respectively. 
      VE was higher against symptomatic (88·3% [98·3% CI: 86·1-90·2%]) than 
      asymptomatic COVID-19 (72·7% [53·4-84·0%]), but was generally similar across age, 
      sex, and racial/ethnic subgroups. VE among individuals with history of COVID-19 
      ranged from 8·2-33·6%. The most prevalent variants were Alpha (41·6%), Epsilon 
      (17·5%), Delta (11·5%), and Gamma (9·1%), with Delta increasing to 54·0% of 
      variants by June 2021. INTERPRETATION: These interim results provide reassuring 
      evidence of the VE of 2 doses of mRNA-1273 across age, sex, and racial/ethnic 
      subgroups, and against asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19, and severe COVID-19 
      outcomes. Among individuals with history of COVID-19, mRNA-1273 vaccination may 
      offer added protection beyond immunity acquired from prior infection. Longer 
      follow-up is needed to fully evaluate VE of mRNA-1273 against emerging SARS-CoV-2 
      variants. FUNDING: Moderna Inc.

AB  - Outcomes of 109 hospitalized COVID-19 patients who received at least one vaccine 
      dose 14 or more days prior the disease onset were retrospectively compared to 
      control cohort of 109 age, sex, and Charlson comorbidity index-matched patients 
      chosen among 2990 total hospitalized patients in our tertiary-level institution 
      in a period from January to June 2021. Among 109 vaccinated patients, 84 patients 
      were partially and 25 fully vaccinated. Vaccinated patients experienced 
      significantly lower 30 days mortality (30% vs. 49%; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.56 
      [0.37-0.85]; p = 0.008), less frequently required high flow oxygen therapy (17% 
      vs. 34%; HR: 0.45 [0.26-0.76]; p = 0.005), and mechanical ventilation (8% vs. 
      18%; HR: 0.41 [0.20-0.88]; p = 0.027) in comparison to the matched cohort of 
      unvaccinated patients. More favorable survival was observed in patients receiving 
      vector in comparison to messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine types in unadjusted analysis 
      (30 days mortality 18% vs. 40%; HR: 0.45 [0.25-0.79]; p = 0.034). In the 
      multivariable Cox regression analysis model both mRNA (HR: 0.59 [0.36-0.98]; 
      p = 0.041) and vector vaccine types (HR: 0.30 [0.15-0.60]; p < 0.001) were 
      associated with improved survival in comparison to unvaccinated patients, 
      independently of age (HR: 1.03 [1.01-1.06]; p = 0.011), male sex (HR: 1.78 
      [1.14-2.76]; p = 0.010), severity of illness (HR: 2.06 [1.36-3.10]; p < 0.001) 
      and functional status on admission (HR: 1.42 [1.07-1.85]; p = 0.013).

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the emergency use authorization of multiple vaccines against 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, data are urgently needed to determine their effectiveness 
      in a real-world setting. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the short-term effectiveness of 
      vaccines in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN: Test-negative case-control 
      study using conditional logistic regression. SETTING: U.S. Department of Veterans 
      Affairs health care system. PARTICIPANTS: All veterans who had testing for 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection between 15 December 2020 and 4 March 2021 and no confirmed 
      infection before 15 December 2020. INTERVENTION: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with 
      either the BNT-162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine as part of 
      routine clinical care. MEASUREMENTS: Effectiveness of vaccination against 
      confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Among 54 360 persons who tested positive 
      and 54 360 propensity score-matched control participants, the median age was 61 
      years, 83.6% were male, and 62% were White. Median body mass index was 31 kg/m(2) 
      among those who tested positive and 30 kg/m(2) among those who tested negative. 
      Among those who tested positive, 9800 (18.0%) had been vaccinated; among those 
      who tested negative, 17 825 (32.8%) had been vaccinated. Overall vaccine 
      effectiveness 7 or more days after the second dose was 97.1% (95% CI, 96.6% to 
      97.5%). Effectiveness was 96.2% (CI, 95.5% to 96.9%) for the Pfizer-BioNTech 
      BNT-162b2 vaccine and 98.2% (CI, 97.5% to 98.6%) for the Moderna mRNA-1273 
      vaccine. Effectiveness remained above 95% regardless of age group, sex, race, or 
      presence of comorbidities. LIMITATIONS: Predominantly male population; lack of 
      data on disease severity, mortality, and effectiveness by SARS-CoV-2 variants of 
      concern; and short-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: Currently used vaccines against 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection are highly effective in preventing confirmed infection in a 
      high-risk population in a real-world setting. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None.

AB  - BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of 
      pregnancy-related complications and neonatal respiratory distress and 
      hospitalization. Effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in pregnant women is not 
      known.MethodsAll women with confirmed pregnancy who presented to the national 
      referral hospital in Qatar between December 20, 2020, and May 30, 2021, with at 
      least 1 SARS-CoV-2 test and not testing prior to pregnancy were included. We 
      determined the vaccine effectiveness of mRNA vaccines in preventing confirmed 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy using both cohort and test-negative 
      case-control designs. Analyses were adjusted for age group, nationality, and 
      gestational age.ResultsAmong 4534 pregnant women, there were 407 vaccinated and 
      407 unvaccinated women in the matched cohort analysis. Vaccine effectiveness was 
      87.6% (95%CI 44.1%-97.2%) at least 14 days after the second dose. There were 386 
      test-positive and 834 matched women in the test-negative case control analysis. 
      Vaccine effectiveness was 86.8% (95%CI 47.5%-98.5%) at least 14 days after the 
      second dose. Adjustment for age, nationality, and gestational age yielded similar 
      results for both designs. In the test-negative analysis, vaccine effectiveness at 
      least 14 days after the first dose but before the second dose was 40.8% (95% CI 
      0.0%-80.4%). Of the 386 test-positive pregnant women, 74 cases were Alpha 
      variant, 163 cases were Beta variant, and 156 cases were variants of unknown 
      status. There were 9 severe or critical disease cases and no deaths in the 
      test-positive pregnant women, all of whom were unvaccinated.ConclusionThe mRNA 
      vaccines provide a high level of protection against documented SARS-CoV-2 
      infection, which supports the inclusion of pregnant women in vaccination 
      campaigns.FUNDINGHamad Medical Corporation, Weill Cornell Medicine Qatar, and the

TI  - Relative Vaccine Effectiveness of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 
      2 Messenger RNA Vaccine Booster Dose Against the Omicron Variant.
PG  - 2161-2168
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac328 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines may be less effective against the Omicron variant than 
      against earlier variants. With recent resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 cases, the role of 
      booster doses of the vaccine needs to be highlighted. METHODS: Using a 
      retrospective cohort study design emulating a target trial, we determined the 
      relative vaccine effectiveness (RVE) of a homologous booster dose of a SARS-CoV-2 
      messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine compared with the primary vaccine series alone in 
      preventing infection, hospitalization, and intensive care unit admission, and 
      death in the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system in the United 
      States. Among infection-free survivors who received 2 doses of a mRNA vaccine 
      before 30 April 2021, we identified those who received a booster between 22 
      September and 25 December 2021 and matched them 1:1 with individuals who did not 
      receive a booster. RESULTS: Among 2 384 272 previously uninfected persons with 2 
      doses of an mRNA vaccine by 30 April 2021, we identified 462 950 booster 
      recipients between 22 September and 25 December 2021, who were matched 1:1 with 
      non-booster recipients. The RVE (95% confidence interval) was 19% (17%-22%) for 
      confirmed infection, 52% (46%-57%) for hospitalization, and 83% (65%-92%) for 
      intensive care unit admission or death. Recipients of the mRNA-1273 vaccine had a 
      lower cumulative incidence of infections and hospitalizations than recipients of 
      the BNT162b2 vaccine (log-rank P <.001 for both comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: While 
      the RVE of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA booster vaccine dose in preventing infection against 
      the Omicron variant is low, it is substantial in preventing hospitalization and 
      high in preventing the most severe/critical disease.

TI  - Single-Dose Messenger RNA Vaccine Effectiveness Against Severe Acute Respiratory 
      Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in Healthcare Workers Extending 16 Weeks Postvaccination: 
      A Test-Negative Design From Québec, Canada.
PG  - e805-e813
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciab739 [doi]
LID - ciab739
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Canada, first and second doses of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines 
      against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were 
      uniquely spaced 16 weeks apart. We estimated 1- and 2-dose mRNA vaccine 
      effectiveness (VE) among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Québec, Canada, including 
      protection against varying outcome severity, variants of concern (VOCs), and the 
      stability of single-dose protection up to 16 weeks postvaccination. METHODS: A 
      test-negative design compared vaccination among SARS-CoV-2 test-positive and 
      weekly matched (10:1), randomly sampled, test-negative HCWs using linked 
      surveillance and immunization databases. Vaccine status was defined by 1 dose ≥14 
      days or 2 doses ≥7 days before illness onset or specimen collection. Adjusted VE 
      was estimated by conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Primary analysis 
      included 5316 cases and 53 160 controls. Single-dose VE was 70% (95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 68%-73%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection; 73% (95% CI, 71%-75%) 
      against illness; and 97% (95% CI, 92%-99%) against hospitalization. Two-dose VE 
      was 86% (95% CI, 81%-90%) and 93% (95% CI, 89%-95%), respectively, with no 
      hospitalizations. VE was higher for non-VOCs than VOCs (73% Alpha) among 
      single-dose recipients but not 2-dose recipients. Across 16 weeks, no decline in 
      single-dose VE was observed, with appropriate stratification based upon 
      prioritized vaccination determined by higher vs lower likelihood of direct 
      patient contact. CONCLUSIONS: One mRNA vaccine dose provided substantial and 
      sustained protection to HCWs extending at least 4 months postvaccination. In 
      circumstances of vaccine shortage, delaying the second dose may be a pertinent 
      public health strategy.

TI  - Protection against omicron (B.1.1.529) BA.2 reinfection conferred by primary 
      omicron BA.1 or pre-omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection among health-care workers with 
      and without mRNA vaccination: a test-negative case-control study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data on vaccine-induced or infection-induced 
      (hybrid or natural) immunity against omicron (B.1.1.529) subvariant BA.2, 
      particularly in comparing the effects of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection with the 
      same or different genetic lineage. We aimed to estimate the protection against 
      omicron BA.2 associated with previous primary infection with omicron BA.1 or 
      pre-omicron SARS-CoV-2, among health-care workers with and without mRNA 
      vaccination. METHODS: We conducted a test-negative case-control study among 
      health-care workers aged 18 years or older who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in 
      Quebec, Canada, between March 27 and June 4, 2022, when BA.2 was the predominant 
      variant and was presumptively diagnosed with a positive test result. We 
      identified cases (positive test during study period) and controls (negative test 
      during study period) using the provincial laboratory database that records all 
      nucleic acid amplification testing for SARS-CoV-2 in Quebec, and used the 
      provincial immunisation registry to determine vaccination status. Logistic 
      regression models compared the likelihood of BA.2 infection or reinfection 
      (second positive test ≥30 days after primary infection) among health-care workers 
      who had previous primary infection and none to three mRNA vaccine doses versus 
      unvaccinated health-care workers with no primary infection. FINDINGS: 258 007 
      SARS-CoV-2 tests were done during the study period. Among those with a valid 
      result and that met the inclusion criteria, there were 37 732 presumed BA.2 cases 
      (2521 [6·7%] reinfections following pre-omicron primary infection and 659 [1·7%] 
      reinfections following BA.1 primary infection) and 73 507 controls (7360 [10·0%] 
      had pre-omicron primary infection and 12 315 [16·8%] had BA.1 primary infection). 
      Pre-omicron primary infection was associated with a 38% (95% CI 19-53) reduction 
      in BA.2 infection risk, with higher BA.2 protection among those who had also 
      received one (56%, 95% CI 47-63), two (69%, 64-73), or three (70%, 66-74) mRNA 
      vaccine doses. Omicron BA.1 primary infection was associated with greater 
      protection against BA.2 infection (risk reduction of 72%, 95% CI 65-78), and 
      protection was increased further among those who had received two doses of mRNA 
      vaccine (96%, 95-96), but was not improved with a third dose (96%, 95-97). 
      INTERPRETATION: Health-care workers who had received two doses of mRNA vaccine 
      and had previous BA.1 infection were subsequently well protected for a prolonged 
      period against BA.2 reinfection, with a third vaccine dose conferring no 
      improvement to that hybrid protection. If this protection also pertains to future 
      variants, there might be limited benefit from additional vaccine doses for people 
      with hybrid immunity, depending on timing and variant. FUNDING: Ministère de la 
      Santé et des Services Sociaux du Québec.

TI  - Association of COVID-19 Vaccination During Pregnancy With Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 
      Infection in Infants.
PG  - 825-831
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2022.2442 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Pregnant women are recommended to receive COVID-19 vaccination to 
      reduce risk of severe COVID-19. Whether vaccination during pregnancy also 
      provides passive protection to infants after birth remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To 
      determine whether COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy was associated with reduced 
      risk of COVID-19 in infants up to age 4 months during COVID-19 pandemic periods 
      dominated by Delta and Omicron variants. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 
      nationwide, register-based cohort study included all live-born infants born in 
      Norway between September 1, 2021, and February 28, 2022. EXPOSURES: Maternal 
      messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccination during second or third trimester compared with 
      no vaccination before or during pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The risk 
      of a positive polymerase chain reaction test result for SARS-CoV-2 during an 
      infant's first 4 months of life by maternal vaccination status during pregnancy 
      with either dose 2 or 3 was estimated, as stratified by periods dominated by the 
      Delta variant (between September 1 and December 31, 2021) or Omicron variant 
      (after January 1, 2022, to the end of follow-up on April 4, 2022). A Cox 
      proportional hazard regression was used, adjusting for maternal age, parity, 
      education, maternal country of birth, and county of residence. RESULTS: Of 21 643 
      live-born infants, 9739 (45.0%) were born to women who received a second or third 
      dose of a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy. The first 4 months of life incidence 
      rate of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 was 5.8 per 10 000 follow-up days. Infants 
      of mothers vaccinated during pregnancy had a lower risk of a positive test 
      compared with infants of unvaccinated mothers and lower risk during the Delta 
      variant-dominated period (incidence rate, 1.2 vs 3.0 per 10 000 follow-up days; 
      adjusted hazard ratio, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.19-0.46) compared with the Omicron period 
      (incidence rate, 7.0 vs 10.9 per 10 000 follow-up days; adjusted hazard ratio, 
      0.67; 95% CI, 0.57-0.79). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this 
      Norwegian population-based cohort study suggested a lower risk of a positive test 
      for SARS-CoV-2 during the first 4 months of life among infants born to mothers 
      who were vaccinated during pregnancy. Maternal COVID-19 vaccination may provide 
      passive protection to young infants, for whom COVID-19 vaccines are currently not 
      available.

TI  - Healthcare Economics of a Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pop-Up Vaccination Center.
PG  - 191-197
AB  - Introduction: Creation of pop-up vaccination sites at trusted community locations 
      has been encouraged to address vaccine hesitancy and provide equitable access to 
      COVID-19 vaccination in minority communities. This study sought to study the 
      healthcare economics of a community-based COVID-19 pop-up vaccination center in 
      terms of the following: costs associated with operating the vaccination center, 
      analysis of billing data from patients who received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, 
      and costs of hospitalization for COVID-19 which may be avoided with widespread 
      vaccination. Methods: The pop-up vaccination center was located in Port Jefferson 
      Station, NY, USA. Costs associated with operation of the COVID-19 pop-up 
      vaccination center were quantified, itemized, and tabulated. Current Procedural 
      Technology codes were used to identify patients who received the Moderna COVID-19 
      vaccine. Billing data were quantified for the cohort as well as per each patient 
      to receive the vaccine. Costs associated with provision of urgent care, 
      emergency, and hospital services to patients with COVID-19 were obtained. 
      Results: The total cost to operate the vaccination center was $25,880. The 
      vaccination center administered the initial dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine 
      to N=251 patients between March and May, 2021. The standard hospital costs for 
      patients admitted to the medical ICU due to COVID-19 ranged from $8,913 to 
      $190,714, per patient. Conclusion: Since the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine series is 
      effective in preventing hospitalization for 93% of patients, this community-based 
      vaccination center's administration of the vaccine series to 240 patients meant 
      aversion of hospitalization due to COVID-19 related morbidity for 223 patients. 
      Therefore, the true impact of this vaccination center, measured in averted 
      hospital costs, ranges from $1,987,599 to $42,529,222.

TI  - The impact of prioritisation and dosing intervals on the effects of COVID-19 
      vaccination in Europe: an agent-based cohort model.

AB  - Different strategies have been used to maximise the effect of COVID-19 
      vaccination campaigns in Europe. We modelled the impact of different 
      prioritisation choices and dose intervals on infections, hospitalisations, 
      mortality, and public health restrictions. An agent-based model was built to 
      quantify the impact of different vaccination strategies over 6 months. Input 
      parameters were derived from published phase 3 trials and official European 
      figures. We explored the effect of prioritising vulnerable people, care-home 
      staff and residents, versus contagious groups; and the impact of dose intervals 
      ranging from 3 to 12 weeks. Prioritising vulnerable people, rather than the most 
      contagious, led to higher numbers of COVID-19 infections, whilst reducing 
      mortality, hospital admissions, and public health restrictions. At a realistic 
      vaccination speed of ≤ 0·1% population/day, separating doses by 12 weeks (vs a 
      baseline scenario of 3 weeks) reduced hospitalisations, mortality, and 
      restrictions for vaccines with similar first- and second-dose efficacy (e.g., the 
      Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines), but not for those with lower first vs 
      second-dose efficacy (e.g., the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine). Mass vaccination will 
      dramatically reduce the effect of COVID-19 on Europe's health and economy. Early 
      vaccination of vulnerable populations will reduce mortality, hospitalisations, 
      and public health restrictions compared to prioritisation of the most contagious 
      people. The choice of interval between doses should be based on expected vaccine 
      availability and first-dose efficacy, with 12-week intervals preferred over 
      shorter intervals in most realistic scenarios.

TI  - Primary SARS-CoV-2 Infections, Re-infections and Vaccine Effectiveness during the 
      Omicron Transmission Period in Healthcare Workers of Trieste and Gorizia 
      (Northeast Italy), 1 December 2021-31 May 2022.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the incidence of primary and recurrent COVID-19 infections 
      in healthcare workers (HCWs) routinely screened for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal 
      swabs during the Omicron wave. Design: Dynamic Cohort study of HCWs (N = 7723) of 
      the University Health Agency Giuliano Isontina (ASUGI), covering health services 
      of the provinces of Trieste and Gorizia (Northeast Italy). Cox proportional 
      hazard model was employed to estimate the risk of primary as well as recurrent 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection from 1 December 2021 through 31 May 2022, adjusting for a 
      number of confounding factors. Results: By 1 December 2021, 46.8% HCWs of ASUGI 
      had received the booster, 37.2% were immunized only with two doses of COVID-19 
      vaccines, 6.0% only with one dose and 10.0% were unvaccinated. During 1 March 
      2020-31 May 2022, 3571 primary against 406 SARS-CoV-2 recurrent infections were 
      counted among HCWs of ASUGI, 59.7% (=2130/3571) versus 95.1% (=386/406) of which 
      occurring from 1 December 2021 through 31 May 2022, respectively. All HCWs 
      infected by SARS-CoV-2 during 1 December 2021 through 31 May 2022 presented mild 
      flu-like disease. Compared to staff working in administrative services, the risk 
      of primary as well as recurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection increased in HCWs with 
      patient-facing clinical tasks (especially nurses and other categories of HCWs) 
      and in all clinical wards but COVID-19 units and community health services. 
      Regardless of the number of swab tests performed during the study period, primary 
      infections were less likely in HCWs immunized with one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. 
      By contrast, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 re-infection was significantly lower in HCWs 
      immunized with three doses (aHR = 0.58; 95%CI: 0.41; 0.80). During the study 
      period, vaccine effectiveness (VE = 1-aHR) of the booster dose declined to 42% 
      against re-infections, vanishing against primary SARS-CoV-2 infections. 
      Conclusions: Though generally mild, SARS-CoV-2 infections and re-infections 
      surged during the Omicron transmission period. Compared to unvaccinated 
      colleagues, the risk of primary SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly lower in 
      HCWs immunized just with one dose of COVID-19 vaccines. By Italian law, HCWs 
      immunized only with one dose were either suspended or re-assigned to job tasks 
      not entailing patient facing contact; hence, while sharing the same biological 
      risk of unvaccinated colleagues, they arguably had a higher level of protection 
      against COVID-19 infection. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 re-infections were less 
      likely in HCWs vaccinated with three doses, suggesting that hybrid humoral 
      immunity by vaccination combined with natural infection provided a higher level 
      of protection than vaccination only. In this stage of the pandemic, where 
      SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious yet much less pathogenic, health protection 
      measures in healthcare premises at higher biological risk seem the rational 
      approach to control the transmission of the virus.

AB  - There is considerable interest in the waning of effectiveness of coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and vaccine effectiveness (VE) of booster doses. 
      Using linked national Brazilian databases, we undertook a test-negative design 
      study involving almost 14 million people (~16 million tests) to estimate VE of 
      CoronaVac over time and VE of BNT162b2 booster vaccination against 
      RT-PCR-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes (hospitalization or death). Compared with 
      unvaccinated individuals, CoronaVac VE at 14-30 d after the second dose was 55.0% 
      (95% confidence interval (CI): 54.3-55.7) against confirmed infection and 82.1% 
      (95% CI: 81.4-82.8) against severe outcomes. VE decreased to 34.7% (95% CI: 
      33.1-36.2) against infection and 72.5% (95% CI: 70.9-74.0) against severe 
      outcomes over 180 d after the second dose. A BNT162b2 booster, 6 months after the 
      second dose of CoronaVac, improved VE against infection to 92.7% (95% CI: 
      91.0-94.0) and VE against severe outcomes to 97.3% (95% CI: 96.1-98.1) 14-30 d 
      after the booster. Compared with younger age groups, individuals 80 years of age 
      or older had lower protection after the second dose but similar protection after 
      the booster. Our findings support a BNT162b2 booster vaccine dose after two doses 
      of CoronaVac, particularly for the elderly.

AB  - To date, no information has been published on the effectiveness of inactivated 
      whole-virus COVID-19 vaccines plus heterologous booster against symptomatic 
      infection and severe outcomes (hospitalization or death) during the dominance of 
      the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant period. We evaluated the vaccine effectiveness 
      (VE) of CoronaVac plus BNT162b2 booster during the period of dominance of the 
      Omicron variant in Brazil (January to April 2022). Using a test-negative design, 
      we analysed data for 2,471,576 individuals tested during the Omicron variant's 
      dominant period using a nationally linked database from Brazil. Compared to 
      unvaccinated, vaccinees maintained protection against severe outcomes, with an 
      estimated VE of 84.1% (95% CI:83.2-84.9) at more than 120 days after BNT162b2 
      booster. Furthermore, while we detected a high level of protection against severe 
      outcomes for individuals up to 79 years old, waning was observed for individuals 
      aged ≥80 years, with VE decreasing from 81.3% (95% CI:77.9-84.2) at 31-60 days to 
      72.9% (95% CI:70.6-75.1) at 120 days or more after the booster dose. However, no 
      significant protection against symptomatic infection was observed at this time 
      period. In conclusion, except for individuals aged ≥80 years, CoronaVac plus a 
      BNT162b2 booster dose offered high and durable protection against severe outcomes 
      due to Omicron.

TI  - Coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine effectiveness among a population-based cohort of 
      people living with HIV.
PG  - F17-F26
LID - 10.1097/QAD.0000000000003405 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: People with HIV were underrepresented in coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) vaccine clinical trials. We estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) 
      against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection 
      for the BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and ChAdOx1 vaccines among a population-based cohort 
      of people with HIV in Ontario, Canada. DESIGN: Test-negative design. METHODS: We 
      identified people with HIV aged ≥19 years who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by 
      RT-PCR between December 14, 2020 (first availability of COVID-19 vaccines) and 
      November 21, 2021 (pre-Omicron circulation). Outcomes included any infection, 
      symptomatic infection, and COVID-19-related hospitalization/death. We compared 
      the odds of vaccination between test-positive cases and test-negative controls 
      using multivariable logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, region, 
      calendar time, SARS-CoV-2 test histories, influenza vaccination, comorbidities, 
      and neighborhood-level socio-economic status. VE was derived as (1 - adjusted 
      odds ratio) × 100%. RESULTS: Among 21 023 adults living with HIV, there were 801 
      (8.3%) test-positive cases and 8,879 (91.7%) test-negative controls. 20.1% cases 
      and 47.8% of controls received ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose; among two-dose 
      recipients, 93.4% received ≥1 mRNA dose. Two-dose VE ≥7 days before specimen 
      collection was 82% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 74-87%) against any infection, 
      94% (95% CI = 82-98%) against symptomatic infection, and 97% (95% CI = 85-100%) 
      against hospitalization/death. Against any infection, VE declined from 86% (95% 
      CI = 77-92%) within 7-59 days after the second dose to 66% (95% CI = -15-90%) 
      after ≥180 days; we did not observe evidence of waning protection for other 
      outcomes. CONCLUSION: Two doses of COVID-19 vaccine offered substantial 
      protection against symptomatic illness and hospitalization/death in people with 
      HIV prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant. Our findings do not support a 
      broad conclusion that COVID-19 VE is lower among people with HIV in populations 
      that, for the most part, are attending HIV care, taking antiretroviral 
      medication, and are virally suppressed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are highly effective for 
      reducing severe disease and mortality. However, vaccine effectiveness data are 
      limited from Sub-Saharan Africa. We report COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against 
      progression to in-hospital mortality in Zambia. METHODS: We conducted a 
      retrospective cohort study among admitted patients at 8 COVID-19 treatment 
      centers across Zambia during April 2021 through March 2022, when the Delta and 
      Omicron variants were circulating. Patient demographic and clinical information 
      including vaccination status and hospitalization outcome (discharged or died) 
      were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the odds of 
      in-hospital mortality by vaccination status, adjusted for age, sex, number of 
      comorbid conditions, disease severity, hospitalization month, and COVID-19 
      treatment center. Vaccine effectiveness of ≥1 vaccine dose was calculated from 
      the adjusted odds ratio. RESULTS: Among 1653 patients with data on their 
      vaccination status and hospitalization outcome, 365 (22.1%) died. Overall, 236 
      (14.3%) patients had received ≥1 vaccine dose before hospital admission. Of the 
      patients who had received ≥1 vaccine dose, 22 (9.3%) died compared with 343 
      (24.2%) among unvaccinated patients (P < .01). The median time since receipt of a 
      first vaccine dose (interquartile range) was 52.5 (28-107) days. Vaccine 
      effectiveness for progression to in-hospital mortality among hospitalized 
      patients was 64.8% (95% CI, 42.3%-79.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients admitted to 
      COVID-19 treatment centers in Zambia, COVID-19 vaccination was associated with 
      lower progression to in-hospital mortality. These data are consistent with 
      evidence from other countries demonstrating the benefit of COVID-19 vaccination 
      against severe complications. Vaccination is a critical tool for reducing the 
      consequences of COVID-19 in Zambia.

TI  - Comparing self-reported reactogenicity between adolescents and adults following 
      the use of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccine: a 
      prospective cohort study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although clinical data have shown that the BNT162b2 vaccine, which is 
      widely used in many countries, is safe and effective as a protection against the 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, extant research in adverse reactions using real-world data 
      of various sociodemographic characteristics is scant. METHODS: We conducted a 
      prospective cohort study to compare age differences in self-reported 
      reactogenicity of BNT162b2 in Hong Kong. A total of 1,516 participants were 
      intensively followed up for two weeks following both doses of BNT162b2 
      vaccination, during which their basic demographic, health conditions, and 
      medication information were collected. RESULTS: Results from the generalized 
      mixed model showed that compared with adults aged 18 to 59 years, older adults 
      aged 60 years or above had a lower risk of adverse reactions and adolescents aged 
      12 to 17 years had a moderately higher risk. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study 
      should be informative to parents considering BNT162b2 vaccination for their 
      children in that moderately increased reactogenicity compared with adults is 
      anticipated.

TI  - Impact of original, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351/P.1 SARS-CoV-2 lineages on vaccine 
      effectiveness of two doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines: Results from a nationwide 
      case-control study in France.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the effectiveness of two doses of mRNA COVID-19 
      vaccines against COVID-19 with the original virus and other lineages circulating 
      in France. METHODS: In this nationwide case-control study, cases were SARS-CoV-2 
      infected adults with onset of symptoms between 14 February and 3 May 2021. 
      Controls were non-infected adults from a national representative panel matched to 
      cases by age, sex, region, population density and calendar week. Participants 
      completed an online questionnaire on recent activity-related exposures and 
      vaccination history. Information about the infecting virus was based on a 
      screening RT-PCR for either B.1.1.7 or B.1.351/P.1 variants. FINDINGS: Included 
      in our analysis were 7 288 adults infected with the original SARS-CoV-2 virus, 31 
      313 with the B.1.1.7 lineage, 2 550 with B.1.351/P1 lineages, and 3 644 controls. 
      In multivariable analysis, the vaccine effectiveness (95% confidence interval) 
      seven days after the second dose of mRNA vaccine was estimated at 88% (81-92), 
      86% (81-90) and 77% (63-86) against COVID-19 with the original virus, the B.1.1.7 
      lineage, and the B.1.351/P.1 lineages, respectively. Recent (2 to 6 months) 
      history of virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was found to be 83% 
      (76-88), 88% (85-91) and 83% (71-90) protective against COVID-19 with the 
      original virus, the B.1.1.7 lineage, and the B.1.351/P.1 lineages, respectively; 
      and more distant (> 6 months) infections were 76% (54-87), 84% (75-90), and 74% 
      (41-89) protective against COVID-19 with the original virus, the B.1.1.7 lineage, 
      and the B.1.351/P.1 lineages, respectively. INTERPRETATION: In real-life 
      settings, two doses of mRNA vaccines proved to be effective against COVID-19 with 
      the original virus, B.1.1.7 lineage and B.1.351/P.1 lineages. FUNDING: Institut

TI  - Effectiveness of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in prevention of hospitalisations 
      and severe disease in adults with SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron 
      (B.1.1.529) variant between June 2021 and July 2022: A prospective test negative 
      case-control study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whilst other studies have reported the effectiveness of mRNA 
      vaccination against hospitalisation, including emergency department or intensive 
      care admission, few have assessed effectiveness against other more clinically 
      robust indices of COVID-19 severity. METHODS: A prospective single-centre 
      test-negative design case-control study of adults hospitalised with COVID-19 
      disease or other acute respiratory disease between 1 June 2021 and 20 July 2022. 
      We assessed VE (vaccine effectiveness) against hospitalisation, length of stay 
      [LOS] >3 days, WHO COVID Score >5 and supplementary oxygen FiO(2) (fraction 
      inspired oxygen) >28%, conducting regression analyses controlling for age, 
      gender, index of multiple deprivation, Charlson comorbidity index, time, and 
      community infection prevalence. FINDINGS: 935 controls and 546 cases were 
      hospitalised during the Delta period, with 721 controls and 372 cases 
      hospitalised during the Omicron study period. Two-dose BNT162b2 was associated 
      with VE 82.5% [95% confidence interval 76.2%-87.2%] against hospitalisation 
      following Delta infection, 63.3% [26.9-81.8%], 58.5% [24.8-77.3%], and 51.5% 
      [16.7-72.1%] against LOS >3 days, WHO COVID Score >5, and requirement for FiO2 
      >28% respectively. Three-dose BNT162b2 protection against hospitalisation with 
      Omicron infection was 30.9% [5.9-49.3%], with sensitivity analyses ranging from 
      28.8-72.6%. Protection against LOS >3 days, WHO COVID Score >5 and requirement 
      for FiO2 >28% was 56.1% [20.6-76.5%], 58.8% [31.2-75.8%], and 41.5% [-0.4-66.3%], 
      respectively. In the UK, BNT162b2 was prioritised for high-risk individuals and 
      those aged >75 years. In the latter group we found a higher estimate of VE 
      against hospitalisation of 47.2% [16.8-66.6%]. INTERPRETATION: BNT162b2 
      vaccination results in risk reductions for hospitalisation and multiple patient 
      outcomes following Delta and Omicron COVID-19 infection, particularly in older 
      adults. BNT162b2 remains effective against severe SARS-CoV-2 disease. FUNDING: 
      AvonCAP is an investigator-led project funded under a collaborative agreement by 
      Pfizer.

TI  - mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants 
      and severe COVID-19 disease in Qatar.
PG  - 1614-1621
LID - 10.1038/s41591-021-01446-y [doi]
AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to be a global health concern. The mRNA-1273 
      (Moderna) vaccine was reported to have an efficacy of 94.1% at preventing 
      symptomatic COVID-19 due to infection with 'wild-type' variants in a randomized 
      clinical trial. Here, we assess the real-world effectiveness of this vaccine 
      against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, specifically B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.351 
      (Beta), in Qatar, a population that comprises mainly working-age adults, using a 
      matched test-negative, case-control study design. We show that vaccine 
      effectiveness was negligible for 2 weeks after the first dose, but increased 
      rapidly in the third and fourth weeks immediately before administration of a 
      second dose. Effectiveness against B.1.1.7 infection was 88.1% (95% confidence 
      interval (CI): 83.7-91.5%) ≥14 days after the first dose but before the second 
      dose, and was 100% (95% CI: 91.8-100.0%) ≥14 days after the second dose. 
      Analogous effectiveness against B.1.351 infection was 61.3% after the first dose 
      (95% CI: 56.5-65.5%) and 96.4% after the second dose (95% CI: 91.9-98.7%). 
      Effectiveness against any severe, critical or fatal COVID-19 disease due to any 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection (predominantly B.1.1.7 and B.1.351) was 81.6% (95% CI: 
      71.0-88.8%) and 95.7% (95% CI: 73.4-99.9%) after the first and second dose, 
      respectively. The mRNA-1273 vaccine is highly effective against B.1.1.7 and 
      B.1.351 infections, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, and against any COVID-19 
      hospitalization and death, even after a single dose.

TI  - Waning of BNT162b2 Vaccine Protection against SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Qatar.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Waning of vaccine protection against severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or coronavirus disease 2019 
      (Covid-19) is a concern. The persistence of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine 
      effectiveness against infection and disease in Qatar, where the B.1.351 (or beta) 
      and B.1.617.2 (or delta) variants have dominated incidence and 
      polymerase-chain-reaction testing is done on a mass scale, is unclear. METHODS: 
      We used a matched test-negative, case-control study design to estimate vaccine 
      effectiveness against any SARS-CoV-2 infection and against any severe, critical, 
      or fatal case of Covid-19, from January 1 to September 5, 2021. RESULTS: 
      Estimated BNT162b2 effectiveness against any SARS-CoV-2 infection was negligible 
      in the first 2 weeks after the first dose. It increased to 36.8% (95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 33.2 to 40.2) in the third week after the first dose and reached 
      its peak at 77.5% (95% CI, 76.4 to 78.6) in the first month after the second 
      dose. Effectiveness declined gradually thereafter, with the decline accelerating 
      after the fourth month to reach approximately 20% in months 5 through 7 after the 
      second dose. Effectiveness against symptomatic infection was higher than 
      effectiveness against asymptomatic infection but waned similarly. 
      Variant-specific effectiveness waned in the same pattern. Effectiveness against 
      any severe, critical, or fatal case of Covid-19 increased rapidly to 66.1% (95% 
      CI, 56.8 to 73.5) by the third week after the first dose and reached 96% or 
      higher in the first 2 months after the second dose; effectiveness persisted at 
      approximately this level for 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: BNT162b2-induced protection 
      against SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared to wane rapidly following its peak after 
      the second dose, but protection against hospitalization and death persisted at a 
      robust level for 6 months after the second dose. (Funded by Weill Cornell 
      Medicine-Qatar and others.).

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 subvariants are genetically divergent. We 
      conducted a matched, test-negative, case-control study to estimate duration of 
      protection of the second and third/booster doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines 
      against BA.1 and BA.2 infections in Qatar. BNT162b2 effectiveness was highest at 
      46.6% (95% CI: 33.4-57.2%) against symptomatic BA.1 and at 51.7% (95% CI: 
      43.2-58.9%) against symptomatic BA.2 infections in the first three months after 
      the second dose, but declined to ~10% or below thereafter. Effectiveness 
      rebounded to 59.9% (95% CI: 51.2-67.0%) and 43.7% (95% CI: 36.5-50.0%), 
      respectively, in the first month after the booster dose, before declining again. 
      Effectiveness against COVID-19 hospitalization and death was 70-80% after the 
      second dose and >90% after the booster dose. mRNA-1273 vaccine protection showed 
      similar patterns. mRNA vaccines provide comparable, moderate, and short-lived 
      protection against symptomatic BA.1 and BA.2 Omicron infections, but strong and 
      durable protection against COVID-19 hospitalization and death.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The BNT162b2 vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has 
      been authorized for use in children 5 to 11 years of age and adolescents 12 to 17 
      years of age but in different antigen doses. METHODS: We assessed the real-world 
      effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine against infection with severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among children and adolescents in 
      Qatar. To compare the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the national cohort of 
      vaccinated participants with the incidence in the national cohort of unvaccinated 
      participants, we conducted three matched, retrospective, target-trial, cohort 
      studies - one assessing data obtained from children 5 to 11 years of age after 
      the B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant became prevalent and two assessing data from 
      adolescents 12 to 17 years of age before the emergence of the omicron variant 
      (pre-omicron study) and after the omicron variant became prevalent. Associations 
      were estimated with the use of Cox proportional-hazards regression models. 
      RESULTS: Among children, the overall effectiveness of the 10-μg primary vaccine 
      series against infection with the omicron variant was 25.7% (95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 10.0 to 38.6). Effectiveness was highest (49.6%; 95% CI, 28.5 to 
      64.5) right after receipt of the second dose but waned rapidly thereafter and was 
      negligible after 3 months. Effectiveness was 46.3% (95% CI, 21.5 to 63.3) among 
      children 5 to 7 years of age and 16.6% (95% CI, -4.2 to 33.2) among those 8 to 11 
      years of age. Among adolescents, the overall effectiveness of the 30-μg primary 
      vaccine series against infection with the omicron variant was 30.6% (95% CI, 26.9 
      to 34.1), but many adolescents had been vaccinated months earlier. Effectiveness 
      waned over time since receipt of the second dose. Effectiveness was 35.6% (95% 
      CI, 31.2 to 39.6) among adolescents 12 to 14 years of age and 20.9% (95% CI, 13.8 
      to 27.4) among those 15 to 17 years of age. In the pre-omicron study, the overall 
      effectiveness of the 30-μg primary vaccine series against SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      among adolescents was 87.6% (95% CI, 84.0 to 90.4) and waned relatively slowly 
      after receipt of the second dose. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination in children was 
      associated with modest, rapidly waning protection against omicron infection. 
      Vaccination in adolescents was associated with stronger, more durable protection, 
      perhaps because of the larger antigen dose. (Funded by Weill Cornell

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding protection conferred by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      versus COVID-19 vaccination is important for informing vaccine mandate decisions. 
      We compared protection conferred by natural infection versus that from the 
      BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines in Qatar. METHODS: We 
      conducted two matched retrospective cohort studies that emulated target trials. 
      Data were obtained from the national federated databases for COVID-19 
      vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 testing, and COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death 
      between Feb 28, 2020 (pandemic onset in Qatar) and May 12, 2022. We matched 
      individuals with a documented primary infection and no vaccination record 
      (natural infection cohort) with individuals who had received two doses (primary 
      series) of the same vaccine (BNT162b2-vaccinated or mRNA-1273-vaccinated cohorts) 
      at the start of follow-up (90 days after the primary infection). Individuals were 
      exact matched (1:1) by sex, 10-year age group, nationality, comorbidity count, 
      and timing of primary infection or first-dose vaccination. Incidence of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death in the 
      natural infection cohorts was compared with incidence in the vaccinated cohorts, 
      using Cox proportional hazards regression models with adjustment for matching 
      factors. FINDINGS: Between Jan 5, 2021 (date of second-dose vaccine roll-out) and 
      May 12, 2022, 104 500 individuals vaccinated with BNT162b2 and 61 955 individuals 
      vaccinated with mRNA-1273 were matched to unvaccinated individuals with a 
      documented primary infection. During follow-up, 7123 SARS-CoV-2 infections were 
      recorded in the BNT162b2-vaccinated cohort and 3583 reinfections were recorded in 
      the matched natural infection cohort. 4282 SARS-CoV-2 infections were recorded in 
      the mRNA-1273-vaccinated cohort and 2301 reinfections were recorded in the 
      matched natural infection cohort. The overall adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0·47 (95% CI 0·45-0·48) after previous natural infection 
      versus BNT162b2 vaccination, and 0·51 (0·49-0·54) after previous natural 
      infection versus mRNA-1273 vaccination. The overall adjusted HR for severe (acute 
      care hospitalisations), critical (intensive care unit hospitalisations), or fatal 
      COVID-19 cases was 0·24 (0·08-0·72) after previous natural infection versus 
      BNT162b2 vaccination, and 0·24 (0·05-1·19) after previous natural infection 
      versus mRNA-1273 vaccination. Severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was rare in 
      both the natural infection and vaccinated cohorts. INTERPRETATION: Previous 
      natural infection was associated with lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
      regardless of the variant, than mRNA primary-series vaccination. Vaccination 
      remains the safest and most optimal tool for protecting against infection and 
      COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death, irrespective of previous infection 
      status. FUNDING: The Biomedical Research Program and the Biostatistics,

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Highly effective vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been developed but variants of concerns are 
      worrisome, especially B.1.617.2 (Delta) which has rapidly spread across the 
      world. We aim to study if vaccination alters virological and serological kinetics 
      in breakthrough infections. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre retrospective 
      cohort study of patients in Singapore who had received a licensed mRNA vaccine 
      and been admitted to hospital with B.1.617.2 SARS-CoV-2 infection. We compared 
      clinical features, virological and serological kinetics (anti-nucleocapsid, 
      anti-spike and surrogate virus neutralization titres) between fully vaccinated 
      and unvaccinated individuals. RESULTS: Out of 218 individuals with B.1.617.2 
      infection, 84 received an mRNA vaccine of which 71 were fully vaccinated, 130 
      were unvaccinated and four received a non-mRNA vaccine. Despite significantly 
      older age in the vaccine breakthrough group, only 2.8% (2/71) developed severe 
      COVID-19 requiring oxygen supplementation compared with 53.1% (69/130) in the 
      unvaccinated group (p < 0.001). Odds of severe COVID-19 following vaccination 
      were significantly lower (adjusted odds ratio 0.07 95% CI 0.015-0.335, p 0.001). 
      PCR cycle threshold values were similar between vaccinated and unvaccinated 
      groups at diagnosis, but viral loads decreased faster in vaccinated individuals. 
      Early, robust boosting of anti-spike protein antibodies was observed in 
      vaccinated patients; however, these titres were significantly lower against 
      B.1.617.2 than the wildtype vaccine strain. DISCUSSION: The mRNA vaccines are 
      highly effective at preventing symptomatic and severe COVID-19 associated with 
      B.1.617.2 infection. Vaccination is associated with faster decline in viral RNA 
      load and a robust serological response. Vaccination remains a key strategy for 
      control of the COVID-19 pandemic.

      national cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Singapore offered the BNT162b2 vaccine (tozinameran; Pfizer-BioNTech) 
      to adolescents aged 12-17 years in May 18, 2021, and extended booster vaccines to 
      this group in Jan 21, 2022. Literature on the effectiveness of primary series and 
      booster vaccination among adolescents is scarce outside of Europe and North 
      America. We aimed to determine primary series and booster vaccine effectiveness 
      against SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalisation among adolescents in Singapore. 
      METHODS: For this national cohort study, we assessed the incidence of confirmed 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalisation among adolescents aged 12-17 years 
      vaccinated with BNT162b2 in Singapore from Sept 1 to Dec 15, 2021, during the 
      delta (B.1.617.2) variant wave, and from Jan 21 to April 28, 2022, during the 
      omicron (B.1.1.529) variant wave. Data were collected from official databases 
      maintained by the Ministry of Health of Singapore. Individuals were classified as 
      partly vaccinated (those who had received one dose and those who had received the 
      second dose no more than 7 days previously), fully vaccinated (8 days after 
      receiving a second dose), or boosted (8 days after receiving a third dose) and 
      compared with unvaccinated individuals. FINDINGS: 249 763 individuals aged 12-17 
      years were included in the study, contributing over 56·2 million person-days of 
      observation. Compared with unvaccinated individuals, two vaccine doses achieved 
      vaccine effectiveness of 66% (95% CI 63-69) against infection with the delta 
      variant and 25% (21-29) against infection with the omicron variant, and 83% 
      (74-89) against delta variant-associated hospitalisation and 75% (56-86) against 
      omicron variant-associated hospitalisation. Booster vaccination with a third dose 
      achieved vaccine effectiveness of 56% (53-58) against infection with the omicron 
      variant and 94% (86-97) against omicron-associated hospitalisation, compared with 
      unvaccinated adolescents. Vaccine effectiveness against infection for both 
      variants after two doses waned over time, whereas vaccine effectiveness against 
      hospitalisation for both variants remained stable; both were increased after 
      three doses. INTERPRETATION: Among adolescents aged 12-17 years, vaccine 
      effectiveness against confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection after two doses of BNT162b2 
      decreased over time and increased after a third dose. Boosted adolescents were 
      also the most protected from hospitalisation compared with fully vaccinated, 
      partly vaccinated, and unvaccinated adolescents. Therefore, the booster dose of 
      BNT162b2 can help to reduce the burden on the health-care system and individual 
      morbidity during an omicron wave. FUNDING: None.

AB  - B ACKGROUND: Prisons and jails are high-risk settings for Covid-19 transmission, 
      morbidity, and mortality. We evaluate protection conferred by prior infection and 
      vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant within the California state 
      prison system. M ETHODS: We employed a test-negative design to match resident and 
      staff cases during the Omicron wave (December 24, 2021-April 14, 2022) to 
      controls according to a case's test-week as well as demographic, clinical, and 
      carceral characteristics. We estimated protection against infection using 
      conditional logistic regression, with exposure status defined by vaccination, 
      stratified by number of mRNA doses received, and prior infection, stratified by 
      periods before or during Delta variant predominance. R ESULTS: We matched 15,783 
      resident and 8,539 staff cases to 180,169 resident and 90,409 staff controls. 
      Among cases, 29.7% and 2.2% were infected before or during the emergence of the 
      Delta variant, respectively; 30.6% and 36.3% were vaccinated with two or three 
      doses, respectively. Estimated protection from Omicron infection for two and 
      three doses were 14.9% (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 12.3-19.7%) and 43.2% 
      (42.2-47.4%) for those without known prior infections, 47.8% (95% CI, 46.6-52.8%) 
      and 61.3% (95% CI, 60.7-64.8%) for those infected before the emergence of Delta, 
      and 73.1% (95% CI, 69.8-80.1%) and 86.8% (95% CI, 82.1-92.7) for those infected 
      during the period of Delta predominance. C ONCLUSION: A third mRNA dose provided 
      significant, additional protection over two doses, including among individuals 
      with prior infection. Our findings suggest that vaccination should remain a 
      priority-even in settings with high levels of transmission and prior infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Information regarding the protection conferred by vaccination and 
      previous infection against infection with the B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant of 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is limited. METHODS: 
      We evaluated the protection conferred by mRNA vaccines and previous infection 
      against infection with the omicron variant in two high-risk populations: 
      residents and staff in the California state prison system. We used a 
      retrospective cohort design to analyze the risk of infection during the omicron 
      wave using data collected from December 24, 2021, through April 14, 2022. 
      Weighted Cox models were used to compare the effectiveness (measured as 1 minus 
      the hazard ratio) of vaccination and previous infection across combinations of 
      vaccination history (stratified according to the number of mRNA doses received) 
      and infection history (none or infection before or during the period of B.1.617.2 
      [delta]-variant predominance). A secondary analysis used a rolling matched-cohort 
      design to evaluate the effectiveness of three vaccine doses as compared with two 
      doses. RESULTS: Among 59,794 residents and 16,572 staff, the estimated 
      effectiveness of previous infection against omicron infection among unvaccinated 
      persons who had been infected before or during the period of delta predominance 
      ranged from 16.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.1 to 23.7) to 48.9% (95% CI, 
      41.6 to 55.3). Depending on previous infection status, the estimated 
      effectiveness of vaccination (relative to being unvaccinated and without previous 
      documented infection) ranged from 18.6% (95% CI, 7.7 to 28.1) to 83.2% (95% CI, 
      77.7 to 87.4) with two vaccine doses and from 40.9% (95% CI, 31.9 to 48.7) to 
      87.9% (95% CI, 76.0 to 93.9) with three vaccine doses. Incremental effectiveness 
      estimates of a third (booster) dose (relative to two doses) ranged from 25.0% 
      (95% CI, 16.6 to 32.5) to 57.9% (95% CI, 48.4 to 65.7) among persons who either 
      had not had previous documented infection or had been infected before the period 
      of delta predominance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings in two high-risk populations 
      suggest that mRNA vaccination and previous infection were effective against 
      omicron infection, with lower estimates among those infected before the period of 
      delta predominance. Three vaccine doses offered significantly more protection 
      than two doses, including among previously infected persons.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines 
      were shown to be highly efficacious in preventing the disease in randomized 
      controlled trials; nonetheless, evidence on the real-world effectiveness of this 
      vaccine is limited. Study objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of BNT162b2 
      vaccine in preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality. 
      METHODS: This historical cohort study included members of a large health provider 
      in Israel that were vaccinated with at least 1 dose of BNT162b2. The primary 
      outcome was incidence rate of a SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed with real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR), between 7 and 27 days after second dose 
      (protection-period), as compared to days 1-7 after the first dose, where no 
      protection by the vaccine is assumed (reference-period). RESULTS: Data of 1 178 
      597 individuals vaccinated with BNT162b2 were analyzed (mean age 47.7 years 
      [SD = 18.1], 48.4% males) of whom 872 454 (74.0%) reached the protection period. 
      Overall, 4514 infections occurred during the reference period compared to 728 
      during the protection period, yielding a weighted mean daily incidence of 54.8 
      per 100 000 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 26.1-115.0 per 100 000) and 5.4 per 
      100 000 (95% CI: 3.5-8.4 per 100 000), respectively. The vaccine effectiveness in 
      preventing infection was 90% (95% CI: 79%-95%) and 94% (95% CI: 88%-97%) against 
      COVID-19. Among immunosuppressed patients, vaccine effectiveness against 
      infection was 71% (95% CI: 37%-87%). The adjusted hazard ratios for 
      hospitalization in those infected were 0.82 (95% CI: .36-1.88), 0.45 (95% CI: 
      .23-.90), and 0.56 (95% CI: .36-.89) in the age groups 16-44, 45-64. and ≥75 
      years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine is 
      comparable to the one reported in the phase III clinical trial.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Recommendations for additional doses of COVID vaccine are restricted 
      to people with HIV who have advanced disease or unsuppressed HIV viral load. 
      Understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection risk post-vaccination among PWH is essential 
      for informing vaccination guidelines. OBJECTIVE: Estimate the risk of 
      breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated people with (PWH) and without 
      (PWoH) HIV in the US. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The 
      Corona-Infectious-Virus Epidemiology Team (CIVET)-II cohort collaboration 
      consists of 4 longitudinal cohorts from integrated health systems and academic 
      health centers. Each cohort identified individuals â‰¥18 years old, in-care, and 
      fully vaccinated for COVID-19 through 30 June 2021. PWH were matched to PWoH on 
      date fully vaccinated, age group, race/ethnicity, and sex at birth. Incidence 
      rates per 1,000 person-years and cumulative incidence of breakthrough infections 
      with 95% confidence intervals ([,]) were estimated by HIV status. Cox 
      proportional hazards models estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 
      breakthrough infections by HIV status adjusting for demographic factors, prior 
      COVID-19 illness, vaccine type (BNT162b2, [Pfizer], mRNA-1273 [Moderna], Jansen 
      Ad26.COV2.S [J&J]), calendar time, and cohort. Risk factors for breakthroughs 
      among PWH, were also investigated. EXPOSURE: HIV infection. OUTCOME: COVID-19 
      breakthrough infections, defined as laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      or COVID-19 diagnosis after an individual was fully vaccinated. RESULTS: Among 
      109,599 individuals (31,840 PWH and 77,759 PWoH), the rate of breakthrough 
      infections was higher in PWH versus PWoH: 44 [41, 48] vs. 31 [29, 33] per 1,000 
      person-years. Cumulative incidence at 210 days after date fully vaccinated was 
      low, albeit higher in PWH versus PWoH overall (2.8% versus 2.1%, log-rank 
      p<0.001, risk difference=0.7% [0.4%, 1.0%]) and within each vaccine type. 
      Breakthrough infection risk was 41% higher in PWH versus PWoH (aHR=1.41 [1.28, 
      1.56]). Among PWH, younger age (18-24 versus 45-54), history of COVID-19 prior to 
      fully vaccinated date, and J&J vaccination (versus Pfizer) were associated with 
      increased risk of breakthroughs. There was no association of breakthrough with 
      HIV viral load suppression or CD4 count among PWH. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      COVID-19 vaccination is effective against infection with SARS-CoV-2 strains 
      circulating through 30 Sept 2021. PWH have an increased risk of breakthrough 
      infections compared to PWoH. Recommendations for additional vaccine doses should 
      be expanded to all PWH.

TI  - The Effectiveness of a Diverse COVID-19 Vaccine Portfolio and Its Impact on the 
      Persistence of Positivity and Length of Hospital Stays: The Veneto Region's 
      Experience.
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10010107 [doi]
LID - 107
AB  - The vaccination campaign for the Veneto region (northeastern Italy) started on 27 
      December 2020. As of early December 2021, 75.1% of the whole Veneto population 
      has been fully vaccinated. Vaccine efficacy has been demonstrated in many 
      clinical trials, but reports on real-world contexts are still necessary. We 
      conducted a retrospective cohort study on 2,233,399 residents in the Veneto 
      region to assess the reduction in the COVID-19 burden, taking different outcomes 
      into consideration. First, we adopted a non-brand-specific approach borrowed from 
      survival analysis to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 
      in preventing infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. We used t-tests and 
      multivariate regressions to examine vaccine impact on breakthrough infections, in 
      terms of the persistence of positivity and the length of hospital stays. Evidence 
      emerging from this study suggests that unvaccinated individuals are significantly 
      more likely to become infected, need hospitalization, and are at a higher risk of 
      death from COVID-19 than those given at least one dose of vaccine. Cox models 
      indicate that the effectiveness of full vaccination is 88% against infection, 94% 
      against hospitalization, and 95% against death. Multivariate regressions suggest 
      that vaccination is significantly correlated with a shorter period of positivity 
      and shorter hospital stays, with each step toward completion of the vaccination 
      cycle coinciding with a reduction of 3.3 days in the persistence of positivity 
      and 2.3 days in the length of hospital stay.

TI  - BNT162b2 Vaccine Effectiveness against Omicron in Children 5 to 11 Years of Age.
PG  - 227-236

LID - NEJMoa2205011
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited evidence is available on the real-world effectiveness of the 
      BNT162b2 vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and specifically 
      against infection with the omicron variant among children 5 to 11 years of age. 
      METHODS: Using data from the largest health care organization in Israel, we 
      identified a cohort of children 5 to 11 years of age who were vaccinated on or 
      after November 23, 2021, and matched them with unvaccinated controls to estimate 
      the vaccine effectiveness of BNT162b2 among newly vaccinated children during the 
      omicron wave. Vaccine effectiveness against documented severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and symptomatic Covid-19 was 
      estimated after the first and second vaccine doses. The cumulative incidence of 
      each outcome in the two study groups through January 7, 2022, was estimated with 
      the use of the Kaplan-Meier estimator, and vaccine effectiveness was calculated 
      as 1 minus the risk ratio. Vaccine effectiveness was also estimated in age 
      subgroups. RESULTS: Among 136,127 eligible children who had been vaccinated 
      during the study period, 94,728 were matched with unvaccinated controls. The 
      estimated vaccine effectiveness against documented infection was 17% (95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 7 to 25) at 14 to 27 days after the first dose and 51% 
      (95% CI, 39 to 61) at 7 to 21 days after the second dose. The absolute risk 
      difference between the study groups at days 7 to 21 after the second dose was 
      1905 events per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 1294 to 2440) for documented infection 
      and 599 events per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 296 to 897) for symptomatic Covid-19. 
      The estimated vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic Covid-19 was 18% (95% CI, 
      -2 to 34) at 14 to 27 days after the first dose and 48% (95% CI, 29 to 63) at 7 
      to 21 days after the second dose. We observed a trend toward higher vaccine 
      effectiveness in the youngest age group (5 or 6 years of age) than in the oldest 
      age group (10 or 11 years of age). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that as 
      omicron was becoming the dominant variant, two doses of the BNT162b2 messenger 
      RNA vaccine provided moderate protection against documented SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      and symptomatic Covid-19 in children 5 to 11 years of age. (Funded by the 
      European Union through the VERDI project and others.).

TI  - Association of Receiving a Fourth Dose of the BNT162b Vaccine With SARS-CoV-2 
      Infection Among Health Care Workers in Israel.
PG  - e2224657

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Despite the high 3-dose vaccination rate among health care workers 
      (HCWs) in Israel, a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections in this group 
      was observed during the Omicron wave. As a result, the Israeli Ministry of Health 
      decided to recommend a fourth vaccine dose to medical staff. OBJECTIVE: To 
      evaluate the benefit of a fourth BNT162b2 vaccine dose on the breakthrough 
      infection rate among HCWs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter 
      cohort study was performed in January 2022, the first month of the 4-dose 
      vaccination campaign, during a surge of the Omicron variant wave. All health care 
      workers at 11 general hospitals in Israel who had been vaccinated with 3 doses up 
      to September 30, 2021, and had not contracted COVID-19 before the vaccination 
      campaign were included. EXPOSURES: Vaccination with a fourth dose of the BNT162b2 
      vaccine during January 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Breakthrough COVID-19 
      infections in 4-dose recipients vs 3-dose recipients measured by a polymerase 
      chain reaction test result positive for SARS-CoV-2. Health care workers were 
      tested based on symptoms or exposure. RESULTS: A total of 29 611 Israeli HCWs 
      (19 381 [65%] female; mean [SD] age, 44 [12] years) had received 3 vaccine doses 
      between August and September 2021; of these, 5331 (18%) received the fourth dose 
      in January 2022 and were not infected by the first week after vaccination. 
      Overall breakthrough infection rates were 368 of 5331 (7%) in the 4-dose group 
      and 4802 of 24280 (20%) in the 3-dose group (relative risk, 0.35; 95% CI, 
      0.32-0.39). Similar reductions were found in a matched analysis by the exact day 
      of receiving the third vaccine (relative risk, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.54-0.71) and in a 
      time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression model (adjusted hazard ratio, 
      0.56; 95% CI, 0.50-0.63). In both groups, no severe disease or death occurred. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, the fourth BNT162b2 vaccine dose 
      resulted in a reduced breakthrough infection rate among hospital staff. This 
      reduction was lower than that observed after the third dose; nevertheless, 
      considering the high infectivity of the Omicron variant, which led to critical 
      medical staff shortages, a fourth vaccine dose should be considered to mitigate 
      the infection rate among HCWs.

TI  - Association between regular physical activity and the protective effect of 
      vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in a South African case-control study.
PG  - 205-211
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2022-105734 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both vaccination and physical activity have been shown to 
      independently decrease the likelihood of severe COVID-19 infection. OBJECTIVE: To 
      assess the association between regular physical activity and vaccination against 
      COVID-19 among healthcare workers. METHODS: A test negative case-control study 
      design was used to estimate the risk of having an associated COVID-19-related 
      hospital admission, among individuals who were unvaccinated compared with those 
      who were fully vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S (>28 days after a single dose). 196 
      444 participant tests were stratified into three measured physical activity 
      subgroups with low, moderate and high activity, to test the hypothesis that 
      physical activity is an effect modifier on the relationship between vaccination 
      and hospitalisation. RESULTS: Vaccine effectiveness against a COVID-19-related 
      admission among vaccinated individuals within the low activity group was 60.0% 
      (95% CI 39.0 to 73.8), 72.1% (95% CI 55.2 to 82.6) for the moderate activity 
      group, and 85.8% (95% CI 74.1 to 92.2) for the high activity group. Compared with 
      individuals with low activity levels, vaccinated individuals with moderate and 
      high activity levels had a 1.4 (95% CI 1.36 to 1.51) and 2.8 (95% CI 2.35 to 
      3.35) times lower risk of COVID-19 admission, respectively (p value <0.001 for 
      both groups). CONCLUSIONS: Regular physical activity was associated with improved 
      vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 hospitalisation, with higher levels of 
      physical activity associated with greater vaccine effectiveness. Physical 
      activity enhances vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19 outcomes and 
      should be encouraged by greater public health messaging.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Continuous assessment of the effectiveness and safety of the US Food 
      and Drug Administration-authorized SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is critical to amplify 
      transparency, build public trust, and ultimately improve overall health outcomes. 
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the Johnson & Johnson Ad26.COV2.S 
      vaccine for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      This comparative effectiveness research study used large-scale longitudinal 
      curation of electronic health records from the multistate Mayo Clinic Health 
      System (Minnesota, Arizona, Florida, Wisconsin, and Iowa) to identify vaccinated 
      and unvaccinated adults between February 27 and July 22, 2021. The unvaccinated 
      cohort was matched on a propensity score derived from age, sex, zip code, race, 
      ethnicity, and previous number of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction tests. The 
      final study cohort consisted of 8889 patients in the vaccinated group and 88 898 
      unvaccinated matched patients. EXPOSURE: Single dose of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. 
      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The incidence rate ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 
      the vaccinated vs unvaccinated control cohorts, measured by SARS-CoV-2 polymerase 
      chain reaction testing. RESULTS: The study was composed of 8889 vaccinated 
      patients (4491 men [50.5%]; mean [SD] age, 52.4 [16.9] years) and 88 898 
      unvaccinated patients (44 748 men [50.3%]; mean [SD] age, 51.7 [16.7] years). The 
      incidence rate ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the vaccinated vs unvaccinated 
      control cohorts was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.20-0.34) (60 of 8889 vaccinated patients vs 
      2236 of 88 898 unvaccinated individuals), which corresponds to an effectiveness 
      of 73.6% (95% CI, 65.9%-79.9%) and a 3.73-fold reduction in SARS-CoV-2 
      infections. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study's findings are consistent with 
      the clinical trial-reported efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S and the first retrospective 
      analysis, suggesting that the vaccine is effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 
      infection, even with the spread of variants such as Alpha or Delta that were not 
      present in the original studies, and reaffirm the urgent need to continue mass 
      vaccination efforts globally.

TI  - Persistence of protection against SARS-CoV-2 clinical outcomes up to 9 months 
      since vaccine completion: a retrospective observational analysis in Lombardy, 
      Italy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Scarce information is available on the duration of the protective 
      effect of COVID-19 vaccination against the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its 
      severe clinical consequences. We investigated the effect of time since vaccine 
      completion on the SARS-CoV-2 infection and its severe forms. METHODS: In this 
      retrospective observational analysis using the vaccination campaign integrated 
      platform of the Italian region of Lombardy, 5 351 085 individuals aged 12 years 
      or older who received complete vaccination from Jan 17 to July 31, 2021, were 
      followed up from 14 days after vaccine completion until Oct 20, 2021. Changes 
      over time in outcome rates (ie, SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe illness among 
      vaccinated individuals) were analysed with age-period-cohort models. Trends in 
      vaccine effectiveness (ie, outcomes comparison in vaccinated and unvaccinated 
      individuals) were also measured. FINDINGS: Overall, 14 140 infections and 2450 
      severe illnesses were documented, corresponding to incidence rates of 6·7 (95% CI 
      6·6-6·8) and 1·2 (1·1-1·2) cases per 10 000 person-months, respectively. From the 
      first to the ninth month since vaccine completion, rates increased from 4·6 to 
      10·2 infections, and from 1·0 to 1·7 severe illnesses every 10 000 person-months. 
      These figures correspond to relative reduction of vaccine effectiveness of 54·9% 
      (95% CI 48·3-60·6) for infection and of 40·0% (16·2-57·0) for severe illness. The 
      increasing infection rate was greater for individuals aged 60 years or older who 
      received adenovirus-vectored vaccines (from 4·0 to 23·5 cases every 10 000 
      person-months). The increasing severe illness rates were similar for individuals 
      receiving mRNA-based vaccines (from 1·1 to 1·5 every 10 000 person-months) and 
      adenovirus-vectored vaccines (from 0·5 to 0·9 every 10 000 person-months). 
      INTERPRETATION: Although the risk of infection after vaccination, and even more 
      of severe illness, remains low, the gradual increase in clinical outcomes related 
      to SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that the booster campaign should be accelerated 
      and that social and individual protection measures against COVID-19 spread should 
      not be abandoned. FUNDING: None.

TI  - Adverse reactions to Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination of healthcare workers at Malta's 
      state hospital.
PG  - e14605
LID - 10.1111/ijcp.14605 [doi]
LID - e14605
AB  - BACKGROUND: The long-term control of COVID-19 depends on an effective global 
      vaccination strategy. Protecting healthcare workers (HCWs) from serious infection 
      is critical. Malta, a European country, initiated the vaccination roll-out using 
      Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine targeting HCWs. This study determined 
      vaccination adverse effects (AEs) in this cohort. METHOD: An online survey was 
      disseminated to all HCWs via work email (29/3/21 to 9/4/21) to gather AEs 
      regarding pain, redness and swelling at injection site, fever, chills, fatigue, 
      muscle/joint pains, headache, vomiting and diarrhoea severity following each dose 
      (Likert scale). Descriptive, comparative and multiple binary regression analyses 
      were performed. RESULTS: A response of 30.30% (n = 1480) was achieved with the 
      commonest AEs being pain at injection site (88.92% CI 95%: 87.21-90.42), mostly 
      mild (51%) and moderate (43%). Fatigue was reported by 72.97% (CI 95%: 
      70.65-75.17), 42% were mild and 41% were moderate. Females reported significantly 
      (P ≤ .05, respectively) more pain (OR: 1.90), redness (OR: 2.49), swelling at 
      injection site (OR: 1.33), fever (OR: 1.74), chills (OR: 2.32), fatigue (OR: 
      2.43), muscle (OR: 1.54) and joint pains (OR: 2.01), headache (OR: 2.07) and 
      vomiting (OR: 3.43) when adjusted for age and HCW role. Localised AEs were 
      reported following both vaccine doses unlike systemic AEs that were mostly 
      reported after second doses. CONCLUSION: Vaccination benefits outweigh the minor 
      AEs experienced, with females exhibiting a higher susceptibility. The general low 
      vaccination AEs observed within the HCW cohort is encouraging and should help in 
      allaying vaccine hesitancy among the population.

TI  - Implementation of HCV screening in the 1969-1989 birth-cohort undergoing COVID-19 
      vaccination.
PG  - 1012-1016
LID - 10.1111/liv.15216 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The World Health Organization (WHO) goal of hepatitis C virus 
      (HCV) elimination by 2030 relies on the scaling-up of both identification and 
      linkage to care of the infected population, worldwide. In Italy, the estimated 
      burden of HCV carriers who are unaware of their infection amounts to 200 000 
      persons, a projection that reinforces the need for broadening population access 
      to effective screening programmes. METHODS: A pivotal screening programme 
      targeting subjects born between 1969 and 1989 has been conducted in Lombardy, 
      Northern Italy, where point-of-care (POC) testing was offered for free 
      concomitantly to COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: Amongst 7219 subjects born 
      between 1969 and 1989 who underwent HCV screening through POC, 7 (0.10%) subjects 
      tested anti-HCV positive: 5 (0.07%) had confirmed anti-HCV positivity (Table 1) 
      and 4 of them (0.05%) were HCV-RNA positive by standard confirmation tests. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This pivotal study demonstrated the feasibility of a POC-based 
      anti-HCV screening programme in young adults undergoing COVID-19 vaccination. The 
      prevalence of HCV infection in subjects born in the 1969-1989 cohort in Italy 
      seems to be lower than previously estimated. Whether the extension of this 
      programme to subjects born before 1969 could lead to improved screening 
      effectiveness should be a matter of debate.

TI  - Association between previous infection with SARS CoV-2 and the risk of 
      self-reported symptoms after mRNA BNT162b2 vaccination: Data from 3,078 health 
      care workers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health care workers (HCWs) are at high risk of contracting an 
      infection by SARS CoV-2 and thus they are a priority for vaccination. We hereby 
      aim to investigate whether the risk of severe and moderate systemic symptoms 
      (MSS) after vaccination is higher in HCWs with a history of previous COVID-19. 
      METHODS: An online questionnaire was offered to the cohort all HCWs undergoing 
      anti-SARS CoV-2 mRNA BNT162b2 vaccination between January 4th and February 9th 
      2021 in two large tertiary hospitals (ASST Santi Paolo and Carlo) in Milan, 
      Italy. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 was recorded. Local and systemic 
      symptoms after each of the two doses were reported. MSS were those either 
      interfering with daily activities or resulting in time off-work. Factors 
      associated to MSS were identified by logistic regression. FINDINGS: 3,078 HCW 
      were included. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 occurred in 396 subjects 
      (12·9%). 59·6% suffered from ≥1 local or systemic symptom after the first and 
      73·4% after the second dose. MSS occurred in 6·3% of cases (14·4% with previous 
      vs 5·1% with no COVID-19 p<0·001) and in 28·3% (24·5% in COVID-19 vs 28·3% no 
      COVID, p = 0·074) after the first and second dose, respectively. Subjects already 
      experiencing COVID-19 had an independent 3-fold higher risk of MSS after the 
      first and a 30% lower risk after the second dose. No severe adverse events were 
      reported. INTERPRETATION: Our data confirm in a real-world setting, the lack of 
      severe adverse events and the short duration of reactogenicity in already 
      infected HCWs. Possible differences in immune reactivity are drivers of MSS among 
      this group of HCWs, as well as among females and younger individuals. FUNDING: 
      None.

AB  - To evaluate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccine in pregnant 
      women, we conducted an observational cohort study of pregnant women aged 16 years 
      or older, with no history of SARS-CoV-2, who were vaccinated between 20 December 
      2020 and 3 June 2021. A total of 10,861 vaccinated pregnant women were matched to 
      10,861 unvaccinated pregnant controls using demographic and clinical 
      characteristics. Study outcomes included documented infection with SARS-CoV-2, 
      symptomatic COVID-19, COVID-19-related hospitalization, severe illness and death. 
      Estimated vaccine effectiveness from 7 through to 56 d after the second dose was 
      96% (95% confidence interval 89-100%) for any documented infection, 97% (91-100%) 
      for infections with documented symptoms and 89% (43-100%) for COVID-19-related 
      hospitalization. Only one event of severe illness was observed in the 
      unvaccinated group and no deaths were observed in either group. In summary, the 
      BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was estimated to have high vaccine effectiveness in 
      pregnant women, which is similar to the effectiveness estimated in the general 
      population.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of the RBD-Dimer-Based Covid-19 Vaccine ZF2001 in Adults.
PG  - 2097-2111
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2202261 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ZF2001 vaccine, which contains a dimeric form of the 
      receptor-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and 
      aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant, was shown to be safe, with an acceptable 
      side-effect profile, and immunogenic in adults in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. 
      METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 
      trial to investigate the efficacy and confirm the safety of ZF2001. The trial was 
      performed at 31 clinical centers across Uzbekistan, Indonesia, Pakistan, and 
      Ecuador; an additional center in China was included in the safety analysis only. 
      Adult participants (≥18 years of age) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 
      receive a total of three 25-μg doses (30 days apart) of ZF2001 or placebo. The 
      primary end point was the occurrence of symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 
      (Covid-19), as confirmed on polymerase-chain-reaction assay, at least 7 days 
      after receipt of the third dose. A key secondary efficacy end point was the 
      occurrence of severe-to-critical Covid-19 (including Covid-19-related death) at 
      least 7 days after receipt of the third dose. RESULTS: Between December 12, 2020, 
      and December 15, 2021, a total of 28,873 participants received at least one dose 
      of ZF2001 or placebo and were included in the safety analysis; 25,193 
      participants who had completed the three-dose regimen, for whom there were 
      approximately 6 months of follow-up data, were included in the updated primary 
      efficacy analysis that was conducted at the second data cutoff date of December 
      15, 2021. In the updated analysis, primary end-point cases were reported in 158 
      of 12,625 participants in the ZF2001 group and in 580 of 12,568 participants in 
      the placebo group, for a vaccine efficacy of 75.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
      71.0 to 79.8). Severe-to-critical Covid-19 occurred in 6 participants in the 
      ZF2001 group and in 43 in the placebo group, for a vaccine efficacy of 87.6% (95% 
      CI, 70.6 to 95.7); Covid-19-related death occurred in 2 and 12 participants, 
      respectively, for a vaccine efficacy of 86.5% (95% CI, 38.9 to 98.5). The 
      incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events was balanced in the two 
      groups, and there were no vaccine-related deaths. Most adverse reactions (98.5%) 
      were of grade 1 or 2. CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort of adults, the ZF2001 
      vaccine was shown to be safe and effective against symptomatic and 
      severe-to-critical Covid-19 for at least 6 months after full vaccination. (Funded

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine during 
      pregnancy in preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) hospitalizations of infants. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective, 
      multicenter, 1:3 case-control (test-negative) study. Symptomatic hospitalized 
      infants less than 6 months of age, with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain 
      reaction test between January 3, 2021, and March 11, 2021, were matched by age 
      and time to negative controls, hospitalized with symptoms compatible with 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mothers were defined as fully vaccinated who received 2 
      doses of BNT162b2 with the second given 2 weeks to 6 months before delivery; or 
      partially vaccinated, if they received only 1 dose or 2 doses with the second 
      given more than 6 months or less than 2 weeks before delivery. Severe SARS-CoV-2 
      was defined as a need for assisted ventilation. RESULTS: We matched 116 
      SARS-CoV-2 positive infants with 348 negative controls with symptoms compatible 
      with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The effectiveness of fully vaccinated mothers was 
      61.6% (95% CI, 31.9-78.4) and the effectiveness of partially vaccinated mothers 
      was not significant. Effectiveness was higher in infants 0-2 vs 3-6 months of 
      age. The effectiveness (57.1%; 95% CI, 22.8-76.4) was similar when excluding 
      mothers who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. The OR of severe 
      infection in infants born to unvaccinated vs fully vaccinated mothers was 5.8. 
      CONCLUSIONS: At least 2 doses of BNT162b2 vaccine administered during the second 
      or third trimester of pregnancy had an effectiveness of 61.6% in decreasing 
      hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection in infants less than 6 months of age.

TI  - Prospective Evaluation of Side-Effects Following the First Dose of 
      Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine among Healthcare Workers in Saudi Arabia.
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10020223 [doi]
LID - 223
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several different types of vaccines have been developed for the 
      prevention of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Despite several local and systemic 
      side-effects to COVID-19 vaccination reported, the vaccines are still considered 
      the best intervention to tackle the spread of the virus and reduce the severity 
      of COVID-19 infection. However, the reported side-effects continue to have a 
      crucial role in public confidence in the vaccine and its acceptance. This study 
      aimed to investigate the short-term side-effects reported by the healthcare 
      workers (HCWs) in Saudi Arabia after receiving the first dose of the 
      Oxford/AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: A prospective 
      cohort study was conducted among HCWs in the Jazan region of southwestern Saudi 
      Arabia. Healthcare workers who had received the first dose of the COVID-19 
      vaccine and agreed to participate in the study were followed up for 3 weeks post 
      vaccination through a weekly online survey. Information was collected on local 
      and/or systemic side-effects reported following vaccine administration. 
      Participants' general and demographic information was also collected. RESULTS: A 
      total of 57.2% (250/437) of the HCWs who participated in this study reported at 
      least one side-effect. Injection site pain and redness (80.0%), fever (73.2%), 
      whole-body pain/fatigue (56.4%), and headache (48.8%) were the most commonly 
      reported side-effects. Moreover, 12.4% of the participants who reported 
      side-effects needed to see a physician, and only one female participant was 
      admitted to the hospital. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that 
      nationality (Saudi, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.65; 95% CI = 2.40, 5.55) and 
      residency (Jazan governorate, aOR = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.15, 0.95) were the 
      significant factors associated with reporting COVID-19 post-vaccination 
      side-effects, while the number of reported side-effects was found to be 
      significantly influenced by occupation (medical, aOR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.26, 0.66; 
      p < 0.001) and gender (female, aOR = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.38, 0.97; p = 0.038). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Findings of the present study support the safety of the 
      Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine among HCWs in Saudi Arabia. All the reported 
      side-effects were mild-to-moderate side-effects. The findings may help convince 
      vaccine-hesitant individuals and skeptics to accept the COVID-19 vaccine.

TI  - Effect of 2 vs 3 Doses of COVID-19 Vaccine in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel 
      Disease: A Population-based Propensity Matched Analysis.
LID - izac252 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ibd/izac252 [doi]
AB  - AIM: There are limited data on the impact of 2 vs 3 doses of COVID-19 vaccine in 
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The primary aim of the study was 
      to assess the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine based on number of administered doses 
      in patients with IBD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using 
      TriNetX, a multi-institutional database to compare patients with IBD who received 
      1, 2, or 3 doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 to unvaccinated IBD patients 
      (1.1.2020-7.26.2022) to assess the risk of COVID-19 after 1:1 propensity score 
      matching. We also evaluated the impact of vaccine on a composite of severe 
      COVID-19 outcomes including hospitalization, intubation, intensive care unit 
      care, acute kidney injury, or mortality. RESULTS: After propensity score 
      matching, vaccinated patients with 2 (adjusted OR [aOR], 0.8; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 0.6-0.9) and 3 doses (aOR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9) were found to 
      have a lower risk of COVID-19 compared with unvaccinated patients. Vaccinated 
      patients with IBD had a lower risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes (aOR, 0.7; 95% CI, 
      0.6-0.9) compared with unvaccinated patients. There was no difference in the risk 
      of COVID-19 in IBD patients with 2 compared with 3 doses (aOR, 0.97; 95% CI, 
      0.7-1.3). However, IBD patients with 2 doses were at an increased risk for 
      hospitalization due to COVID-19 (aOR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.02-3.11) compared with 
      those that received 3 doses. CONCLUSION: Vaccinated patients with IBD had a lower 
      risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes compared with unvaccinated patients. A third 
      dose of COVID-19 vaccine compared with 2 doses decreases the risk of 
      hospitalization but not breakthrough infection in patients with IBD.

TI  - Effectiveness of an inactivated virus-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBV152, in India: 
      a test-negative, case-control study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that has been 
      deployed in India. The results of the phase 3 trial have shown clinical efficacy 
      of BBV152. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of BBV152 against symptomatic 
      RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We conducted a test-negative, 
      case-control study among employees of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences 
      (a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India), who had symptoms suggestive of 
      COVID-19 and had an RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the peak of the second wave 
      of the COVID-19 pandemic in India between April 15 and May 15, 2021. Cases 
      (test-positives) and controls (test-negatives) were matched (1:1) on the basis of 
      age and gender. The odds of vaccination with BBV152 were compared between cases 
      and controls and adjusted for level of occupational exposure (to COVID-19), 
      previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and calendar time, using conditional logistic 
      regression. The primary outcome was effectiveness of two doses of BBV152 (with 
      the second dose received at least 14 days before testing) in reducing the odds of 
      symptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, expressed as (1 - odds 
      ratio) × 100%. FINDINGS: Between April 15 and May 15, 2021, 3732 individuals had 
      an RT-PCR test. Of these, 2714 symptomatic employees had data on vaccination 
      status, and 1068 matched case-control pairs were available for analysis. The 
      adjusted effectiveness of BBV152 against symptomatic COVID-19 after two doses 
      administered at least 14 days before testing was 50% (95% CI 33-62; p<0·0001). 
      The adjusted effectiveness of two doses administered at least 28 days before 
      testing was 46% (95% CI 22-62) and administered at least 42 days before testing 
      was 57% (21-76). After excluding participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 
      infections, the adjusted effectiveness of two doses administered at least 14 days 
      before testing was 47% (95% CI 29-61). INTERPRETATION: This study shows the 
      effectiveness of two doses of BBV152 against symptomatic COVID-19 in the context 
      of a huge surge in cases, presumably dominated by the potentially immune-evasive 
      delta (B.1.617.2) variant of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings support the ongoing 
      roll-out of this vaccine to help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, while 
      continuing the emphasis on adherence to non-pharmacological measures. FUNDING: 
      None. TRANSLATION: For the Hindi translation of the abstract see Supplementary

TI  - The Effect of Vaccination against COVID-19 in Cancer Patients: Final Results of 
      the COICA Trial.

LID - 10.1159/000525962 [doi]
AB  - Background: The COICA study is an ambispective, observational trial that was 
      conceived to assess the clinical course of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in cancer patients. A recently published, 
      population-based, case-control study reported a reduced vaccine efficacy at 3-6 
      months in cancer patients compared to individuals without cancer. Objectives: The 
      aim of the study was to describe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) outcomes in 
      cancer patients and analyze differences in SARS-CoV-2 outcomes between vaccinated 
      and unvaccinated patients. Methods: Descriptive statistics and frequency counts 
      were used to summarize characteristics of the study population. χ(2) test and the 
      log-rank test were used to compare outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated 
      patients. Results: A total of 141 cancer patients (80 males, 61 females) were 
      recruited at two participating Institutions from March 2020 until April 2022 and 
      observed from the time of positive SARS-CoV-2 test to the time of negativization 
      or death. Approximately 35% of patients had been vaccinated at the time of 
      infection with 2 (16 patients) or 3 (33 patients) vaccine doses. Vaccinated 
      patients consistently and significantly showed improved COVID-19 outcomes 
      compared to unvaccinated patients, with CT-diagnosed pneumonia, hospitalization, 
      O(2) therapy, and death reported in 0% versus 48.6%, 2.0% versus 15.2%, 0% versus 
      14.1%, and 0% versus 7.6%, respectively, of assessable patients (p &#x3c; 0.05). 
      Vaccinated versus unvaccinated patients showed a significantly shorter time to 
      negativization, with a median (95% confidence interval) time of 12 (10-14) versus 
      20 (17-23) days, respectively (p &#x3c; 0.001). Conclusions: Vaccination 
      consistently improved all COVID-19 outcomes. No death was recorded among 
      vaccinated patients. Additional research is especially warranted to establish 
      optimal timing and patient selection for administration of the fourth vaccination 
      dose.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 vaccine booster in solid organ transplant recipients previously 
      immunised with inactivated versus mRNA vaccines: A prospective cohort study.
PG  - 100371

LID - 100371
AB  - BACKGROUND: Solid-organ transplant (SOT) recipients have worse COVID-19 outcomes 
      than general population and effective immunisation in these patients is essential 
      but more difficult to reach. We aimed to determine the immunogenicity of an mRNA 
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccine booster in SOT recipients previously immunised with either 
      inactivated or homologous SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. METHODS: Prospective cohort 
      study of SOT recipients under medical care at Red de Salud UC-CHRISTUS, Chile, 
      previously vaccinated with either CoronaVac or BNT162b2. All participants 
      received a BNT162b2 vaccine booster. The primary study end point was 
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 total IgG antibodies (TAb) seropositivity at 8-12 weeks (56-84 
      days) post booster. Secondary end points included neutralising antibodies (NAb) 
      and specific T-cell responses. FINDINGS: A total of 140 (50% kidney, 38% liver, 
      6% heart) SOT recipients (mean age 54 [13.6] years; 64 [46%] women) were 
      included. Of them, 62 had homologous (three doses of BNT162b2) and 78 
      heterologous vaccine schedules (two doses of CoronaVac followed by BNT162b2 
      booster). Boosters were received at a median of 21.3 weeks after primary 
      vaccination. The proportion achieving TAb seropositivity (82.3% vs 65.4%, 
      P = 0.035) and NAb positivity (77.4% vs 55.1%, P = 0.007) were higher for the 
      homologous versus the heterologous group. On the other hand, the number of IFN-γ 
      and IL-2 secreting SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cells did not differ significantly 
      between groups. INTERPRETATION: This cohort study shows that homologous mRNA 
      vaccine priming plus boosting in SOT recipients, reaches a significantly higher 
      humoral immune response than inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine priming followed by 
      heterologous mRNA booster. FUNDING: School of Medicine, UC-Chile and

AB  - Mexico, one of the countries severely affected by COVID-19, accumulated more than 
      5. 1 all-cause excess deaths/1,000 inhabitants and 2.5 COVID-19 confirmed 
      deaths/1,000 inhabitants, in 2 years. In this scenario of high SARS-CoV-2 
      circulation, we analyzed the effectiveness of the country's vaccination strategy 
      that used 7 different vaccines from around the world, and focused on vaccinating 
      the oldest population first. We analyzed the national dataset published by 
      Mexican health authorities, as a retrospective cohort, separating cases, 
      hospitalizations, deaths and excess deaths by wave and age group. We explored if 
      the vaccination strategy was effective to limit severe COVID-19 during the active 
      outbreaks caused by Delta and Omicron variants. Vaccination of the eldest third 
      of the population reduced COVID-19 hospitalizations, deaths and excess deaths by 
      46-55% in the third wave driven by Delta SARS-CoV-2. These adverse outcomes 
      dropped 74-85% by the fourth wave driven by Omicron, when all adults had access 
      to vaccines. Vaccine access for the pregnant resulted in 85-90% decrease in 
      COVID-19 fatalities in pregnant individuals and 80% decrease in infants 0 years 
      old by the Omicron wave. In contrast, in the rest of the pediatric population 
      that did not access vaccination before the period analyzed, COVID-19 
      hospitalizations increased >40% during the Delta and Omicron waves. Our analysis 
      suggests that the vaccination strategy in Mexico has been successful to limit 
      population mortality and decrease severe COVID-19, but children in Mexico still 
      need access to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to limit severe COVID-19, in particular those 
      1-4 years old.

TI  - The BNT162b2 vaccine is associated with lower new COVID-19 cases in nursing home 
      residents and staff.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine on preventing 
      the spread of COVID-19 and deaths in nursing homes (NH) is unknown. DESIGN: We 
      used zero-inflated negative binomial mixed effects regressions to model the 
      associations of time since the vaccine clinic ending the week of December 27, 
      2020 (cohort 1), January 3, 2021 (cohort 2), or January 10, 2021 (cohort 3) 
      controlling for county rate of COVID-19, bed size, urban location, racial and 
      ethnic census, and level of registered nurses with resident cases and deaths of 
      COVID-19 and staff cases of COVID-19. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All 2501 NHs who 
      held a vaccine clinic from the first 17 states to initiate clinics as part of the 
      Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): 
      Adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) for time in 3, 4, 5, and 6 weeks after the 
      first vaccine clinic for resident cases and deaths of COVID-19 and staff cases of 
      COVID-19. RESULTS: Resident and staff cases trended downward in all three cohorts 
      following the vaccine clinics. Time following the first clinic at 5 and 6 weeks 
      was consistently associated with fewer resident cases (IRR: 0.68 [95% CI: 
      0.54-0.84], IRR: 0.64 [95% CI: 0.48-0.86], respectively); resident deaths (IRR: 
      0.59 [95% CI: 0.45-0.77], IRR: 0.45 [95% CI: 0.31-0.65], respectively); and staff 
      cases (IRR: 0.64 [95% CI: 0.56-0.73], IRR: 0.51 [95% CI: 0.42-0.62], 
      respectively). Other factors associated with fewer resident and staff cases 
      included facilities with less than 50 certified beds and high nurse staffing per 
      resident day (>0.987). Contrary to prior research, higher Hispanic non-white 
      resident census was associated with fewer resident cases (IRR: 0.42, 95% CI: 
      0.31-0.56) and deaths (IRR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.12-0.27). CONCLUSIONS: The BNT162b2 
      vaccine is associated with decreased spread of SARS-CoV-2 in both residents and 
      staff as well as decreased deaths among residents.

TI  - Effect of the 2020/21 season influenza vaccine on SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 
      cohort of Italian healthcare workers.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are a priority group for seasonal influenza 
      vaccination (SIV). The 2020/21 SIV campaign was conducted during the second wave 
      of the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccines, including SIV, may exert non-specific 
      protective effects on other infectious diseases which may be ascribable to the 
      concept of trained immunity. The aim of this study was to explore the association 
      between 2020/21 SIV and SARS-CoV-2 positivity in a cohort of Italian HCWs. 
      METHODS: In this observational study, a cohort of HCWs employed by a large (ca 
      5000 employees) referral tertiary acute-care university hospital was followed up 
      retrospectively until the start of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. The 
      independent variable of interest was the 2020/21 SIV uptake. Both egg-based and 
      cell culture-derived quadrivalent SIVs were available. The study outcome was the 
      incidence of new SARS-CoV-2 infections, as determined by RT-PCR. Multivariable 
      Cox regression was applied in order to discern the association of interest. 
      RESULTS: The final cohort consisted of 2561 HCWs who underwent ≥1 RT-PCR test and 
      accounted for a total of 94,445 person-days of observation. SIV uptake was 35.6%. 
      During the study period, a total of 290 new SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred. The 
      incidence of new SARS-CoV-2 was 1.62 (95% CI: 1.22-2.10) and 3.91 (95% CI: 
      3.43-4.45) per 1000 person-days in vaccinated and non-vaccinated HCWs, 
      respectively, with an adjusted non-proportional hazard ratio of 0.37 (95% CI: 
      0.22-0.62). E-values suggested that unmeasured confounding was unlikely to 
      explain the association. CONCLUSIONS: A lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 
      observed among SIV recipients.

TI  - Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccination with mRNA Vaccines for Patients with 
      Cirrhosis in Hungary: Multicentre Matched Cohort Study.
LID - 10.3390/vaccines11010050 [doi]
LID - 50
AB  - Patients with cirrhosis are vulnerable to hepatic decompensation events and death 
      following COVID-19 infection. Therefore, primary vaccination with COVID-19 
      vaccines is fundamental to reducing the risk of COVID-19 related deaths in 
      patients with cirrhosis. However, limited data are available about the 
      effectiveness of mRNA vaccines compared to other vaccines. The aim of our study 
      was to investigate the efficacy of mRNA vaccines versus other vaccines in 
      cirrhosis. In this retrospective study, we compared clinical characteristics and 
      vaccine effectiveness of 399 COVID-19 patients without cirrhosis (GROUP A) to 52 
      COVID-19 patients with cirrhosis (GROUP B). 54 hospitalised cirrhosis controls 
      without COVID-19 (GROUP C) were randomly sampled 1:1 and matched by gender and 
      age. Of the cirrhosis cases, we found no difference (p = 0.76) in mortality rates 
      in controls without COVID-19 (11.8%) compared to those with COVID-19 (9.6%). 
      However, COVID-19 patients with cirrhosis were associated with higher rates of 
      worsening hepatic encephalopathy, ascites and esophageal varices. Patients with 
      cirrhosis receiving mRNA vaccines had significantly better survival rates 
      compared to viral vector or inactivated vaccines. Primary vaccination with the 
      BNT162b2 vaccine was the most effective in preventing acute hepatic 
      decompensating events, COVID-19 infection requiring hospital admission and 
      in-hospital mortality.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection resulting 
      in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has afflicted tens of millions of 
      people in a worldwide pandemic. A recently developed recombinant Plant-Derived 
      Virus-Like Particle Vaccine candidate for COVID-19 (CoVLP) formulated with AS03 
      has been shown to be well-tolerated and highly immunogenic in healthy adults. 
      Since the target population for the vaccine includes women of childbearing 
      potential, the objective of the study was to evaluate any untoward prenatal and 
      postnatal effects of AS03-adjuvanted CoVLP administered intramuscularly to 
      Sprague-Dawley female rats before cohabitation for mating (22 and 8 days prior) 
      and during gestation (Gestation Days [GD] 6 and 19). The embryo-fetal development 
      (EFD) cohort was subjected to cesarean on GD 21 and the pre/post-natal (PPN) 
      cohort was allowed to naturally deliver. Effects of AS03-adjuvanted CoVLP was 
      evaluated on pregnant rats, embryo-fetal development (EFD), during parturition, 
      lactation and the development of the F1 offspring up to weaning Vaccination with 
      AS03-adjuvanted CoVLP induced an antibody response in F0 females and 
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific maternal antibodies were detected in the offspring 
      at the end of the gestation and lactation periods. Overall, there was no evidence 
      of untoward effects of AS03-adjuvanted CoVLP on the fertility or reproductive 
      performance of the vaccinated F0 females. There was no evidence of untoward 
      effects on embryo-fetal development (including teratogenicity), or early 
      (pre-weaning) development of the F1 offspring. These results support the 
      acceptable safety profile of the AS03-adjuvanted CoVLP vaccine for administration 
      to women of childbearing potential.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccine Effectiveness in Health Care Workers by Dosing Interval 
      and Time Since Vaccination: Test-Negative Design, British Columbia, Canada.
PG  - ofac178
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofac178 [doi]
LID - ofac178
AB  - BACKGROUND: One- and two-dose mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates against 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by dosing 
      interval and time since vaccination were assessed among healthcare workers (HCWs) 
      in publicly funded acute and community (nonresidential) healthcare facilities in 
      British Columbia, Canada. METHODS: A test-negative design was used with controls 
      matched to cases (6:1) on epidemiological week of SARS-CoV-2 test date. mRNA 
      vaccination was defined by receipt of the first dose ≥21 days or second dose ≥14 
      days before the test date. HCWs ≥18 years old tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 
      epi-weeks 3 and 39 (January 17-October 2, 2021) were included, when varying 
      dosing intervals and a mix of circulating variants of concern contributed, 
      including Delta dominance provincially from epi-week 31 (August 1). RESULTS: 
      Single- and two-dose analyses included 1265 and 1246 cases, respectively. The 
      median follow-up period (interquartile range) was 49 (34-69) days for single-dose 
      and 89 (61-123) days for two-dose recipients, with 12%, 31%, and 58% of second 
      doses given 3-5, 6, or ≥7 weeks after the first. Adjusted mRNA VE against 
      SARS-CoV-2 was 71% (95% CI, 66%-76%) for one dose and 90% (95% CI, 88%-92%) for 
      two doses, similar to two heterologous mRNA doses (92%; 95% CI, 86%-95%). 
      Two-dose VE remained >80% at ≥28 weeks post-second dose. Two-dose VE was 
      consistently 5%-7% higher with a ≥7-week vs 3-5-week interval between doses, but 
      with overlapping confidence intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Among HCWs, we report 
      substantial single-dose and strong and sustained two-dose mRNA vaccine 
      protection, with the latter maintained for at least 7 months. These findings 
      support a longer interval between doses, with global health and equity 
      implications.

TI  - Is there any effect of flu vaccine on the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients?
PG  - 71-76
LID - 10.1016/j.vacun.2021.09.001 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: On 11 March, WHO declared a global pandemic caused by a new virus of 
      the family Coronaviridae that has since been called SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 does not 
      have specific antiviral drug treatment currently. There are currently more than 
      one hundred research projects into vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, and 17 
      of them are already being tested on humans, according to the WHO. Until we have 
      an effective vaccine, the possible preventive effect of flu vaccine for 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection based on cross-reactivity has been postulated.Our objective 
      was to analyse the effect of vaccination against flu virus in the season prior to 
      the COVID-19 pandemic in our hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. METHODS: 
      We performed a retrospective observational cohort study of patients admitted to 
      hospital with SARS-CoV2 infection. We analysed the differences between patients 
      who had received or had not the flu vaccination for the 2019-2020 season. 
      RESULTS: We found no significant differences (p = 0.09) in patients who died (43 
      in total), of whom 23 (21.5%) were vaccinated against the flu and 20 (13.5%) were 
      not. In mortality, we obtained an adjusted OR = 0.873 (95% CI: 0.294-2.083), and 
      about the success of health care the adjusted OR was 1.447 (95% CI: 0.610-3.430). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Flu vaccination in patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection had 
      neither a beneficial nor a harmful effect on the clinical courses or outcomes of 
      patients admitted to an European hospital.

TI  - Effectiveness of 2-Dose Vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Against 
      COVID-19-Associated Hospitalizations Among Immunocompromised Adults - Nine 
      States, January-September 2021.
PG  - 1553-1559
LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm7044e3 [doi]
AB  - Immunocompromised persons, defined as those with suppressed humoral or cellular 
      immunity resulting from health conditions or medications, account for 
      approximately 3% of the U.S. adult population (1). Immunocompromised adults are 
      at increased risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes (2) and might not acquire the same 
      level of protection from COVID-19 mRNA vaccines as do immunocompetent adults 
      (3,4). To evaluate vaccine effectiveness (VE) among immunocompromised adults, 
      data from the VISION Network* on hospitalizations among persons aged ≥18 years 
      with COVID-19-like illness from 187 hospitals in nine states during January 
      17-September 5, 2021 were analyzed. Using selected discharge diagnoses,(†) VE 
      against COVID-19-associated hospitalization conferred by completing a 2-dose 
      series of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine ≥14 days before the index hospitalization 
      date(§) (i.e., being fully vaccinated) was evaluated using a test-negative design 
      comparing 20,101 immunocompromised adults (10,564 [53%] of whom were fully 
      vaccinated) and 69,116 immunocompetent adults (29,456 [43%] of whom were fully 
      vaccinated). VE of 2 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine against COVID-19-associated 
      hospitalization was lower among immunocompromised patients (77%; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] = 74%-80%) than among immunocompetent patients (90%; 95% 
      CI = 89%-91%). This difference persisted irrespective of mRNA vaccine product, 
      age group, and timing of hospitalization relative to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that 
      causes COVID-19) B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant predominance in the state of 
      hospitalization. VE varied across immunocompromising condition subgroups, ranging 
      from 59% (organ or stem cell transplant recipients) to 81% (persons with a 
      rheumatologic or inflammatory disorder). Immunocompromised persons benefit from 
      mRNA COVID-19 vaccination but are less protected from severe COVID-19 outcomes 
      than are immunocompetent persons, and VE varies among immunocompromised 
      subgroups. Immunocompromised persons receiving mRNA COVID-19 vaccines should 
      receive 3 doses and a booster, consistent with CDC recommendations (5), practice 
      nonpharmaceutical interventions, and, if infected, be monitored closely and 
      considered early for proven therapies that can prevent severe outcomes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Since its emergence, there have been huge efforts to design 
      vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to inhibit its interpersonal 
      spread. Global vaccine development is the most promising cost-effective method 
      for overcoming the epidemic. However, following reports of post-vaccination 
      thromboembolic adverse effects, there have been raising concerns about the safety 
      profile of the COVID-19 vaccine. AREAS COVERED: We aimed to review the recent 
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines and identify the organ-based 
      major complications of COVID-19 vaccines based on reliable published studies. To 
      find high-quality and large-scale observational, clinical trial, and cohort 
      studies, PubMED, Scholar, Embase, and Web of Science were searched using 
      keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, vaccine, Pfizer (BNT162b2), Johnson and Johnson 
      (Ad26.COV2), Moderna (mRNA-1273), Oxford AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1nCoV19), Coronavac 
      (Sinovac), BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm), adverse effect, and complication. To include 
      all relevant articles, backward searching was also done on similar article 
      citations. Case reports, studies including less than 10 participants, and biased 
      articles were excluded. EXPERT OPINION: Based on data from high-quality and 
      population-based studies, major adverse effects are divided into four major 
      organ-specific groups, including cardiovascular, neurologic, hematologic, and 
      immune-allergic side effects. The incidence of most of these side effects is not 
      different between vaccinated and normal populations, and currently, the benefits 
      of vaccination against COVID-19 are greater than the mortality and morbidity 
      risks of COVID-19 infection. However, further studies, specifically systematic 
      review and meta-analysis, are still indicated to investigate further unknown side 
      effects of these vaccines and the existence of causality between the vaccine and 
      reported adverse events.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunogenicity data shows blunted responses to COVID-19 vaccination 
      among people with MS (pwMS) on certain disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Still, 
      it is uncertain how this data translates into the clinic. OBJECTIVE: To assess 
      the effect of DMTs and other factors on the effectiveness of inactivated 
      vaccination in pwMS. METHODS: This cohort study was conducted in a period in 
      which Iran experienced two COVID-19 peaks caused by the Delta variant. We used 
      multivariable cox regression to compare COVID-19-free survivals, and an ordinal 
      logistic model to compare COVID-19 severity between vaccinated pwMS on different 
      DMTs. RESULTS: A total of 617 pwMS were included in the final analysis, with a 
      mean [SD] follow-up of 25.59 weeks [5.48] after their second dose. 
      Laboratory/imaging-confirmed breakthrough COVID-19 occurred in 15/277 (5.41%) of 
      injectable-treated (reference), 10/61 (16.39%) of fingolimod-treated (adjusted 
      hazard ratio (aHR) [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 2.80 [1.24, 6.29]; P = 0.01), 
      9/128 (7.03%) of other oral-treated (aHR [95%CI]: 1.16 [0.50, 2.68]; P = 0.73), 
      19/145 (13.10%) of anti-CD20-treated (aHR [95%CI]: 2.11 [1.05, 4.22]; P = 0.04), 
      and 6/56 (10.71%) of non-treated pwMS (aHR [95%CI]: 1.52 [0.57, 4.04]; P = 0.40). 
      Age (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] [95%CI]: 1.05 [1.00, 1.10], P = 0.05) number of 
      comorbidities (aOR [95%CI]: 2.05 [1.06, 3.96], P = 0.03), fingolimod therapy (aOR 
      [95%CI]: 10.39 [2.47, 43.62], P < 0.01), and anti-CD20 therapy (aOR [95%CI]: 4.44 
      [1.49, 13.23], P < 0.01) were independently associated with a more severe 
      COVID-19 course. CONCLUSION: The observed results stress the importance of 
      developing personalized vaccination schedules and reservation of COVID-19 
      treatment resources for older pwMS with comorbidities receiving fingolimod or 
      anti-CD20 therapies.

TI  - Enhanced Vaccine Effectiveness during the Delta Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic in 
      the Medicare Population Supports a Multilayered Prevention Approach.

AB  - Throughout the pandemic, individuals 65 years and older have contributed most 
      COVID-19 related deaths. To best formulate effective vaccination and other 
      prevention policies to protect older adults, large scale observational studies of 
      these higher risk individuals are needed. We conducted a Vaccine Effectiveness 
      (VE) study during the B.1.617.2 Delta variant phase of the pandemic in July and 
      August 2021 in a cohort of 17 million Medicare beneficiaries of which 5.7 million 
      were fully vaccinated. We found that individuals fully vaccinated with the 
      Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccines in January 2021 had 2.5 
      times higher breakthrough infections and hospitalizations than those fully 
      vaccinated in March 2021, consistent with waning of vaccine-induced immunity. 
      Measuring VE weekly, we found that VE against hospitalization, and even more so 
      against infection, increased from July 2021 through August 2021, suggesting that 
      in addition to the protective role of vaccination, increased masking or social 
      distancing might have contributed to the unexpected increase in VE. Ongoing 
      monitoring of Medicare beneficiaries should be a priority as new variants 
      continue to emerge, and the VE of the new bivalent vaccines remains to be 
      established. This could be accomplished with a large Medicare claims database and 
      the analytics platform used for this study.

PG  - 744-756

AB  - BACKGROUND: Before the emergence of the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), vaccination reduced transmission 
      of SARS-CoV-2 from vaccinated persons who became infected, potentially by 
      reducing viral loads. Although vaccination still lowers the risk of infection, 
      similar viral loads in vaccinated and unvaccinated persons who are infected with 
      the delta variant call into question the degree to which vaccination prevents 
      transmission. METHODS: We used contact-testing data from England to perform a 
      retrospective observational cohort study involving adult contacts of 
      SARS-CoV-2-infected adult index patients. We used multivariable Poisson 
      regression to investigate associations between transmission and the vaccination 
      status of index patients and contacts and to determine how these associations 
      varied with the B.1.1.7 (alpha) and delta variants and time since the second 
      vaccination. RESULTS: Among 146,243 tested contacts of 108,498 index patients, 
      54,667 (37%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) tests. In 
      index patients who became infected with the alpha variant, two vaccinations with 
      either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (also known as AZD1222), as compared with no 
      vaccination, were independently associated with reduced PCR positivity in 
      contacts (adjusted rate ratio with BNT162b2, 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
      0.21 to 0.48; and with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.78). 
      Vaccine-associated reductions in transmission of the delta variant were smaller 
      than those with the alpha variant, and reductions in transmission of the delta 
      variant after two BNT162b2 vaccinations were greater (adjusted rate ratio for the 
      comparison with no vaccination, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.65) than after two 
      ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinations (adjusted rate ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.82). 
      Variation in cycle-threshold (Ct) values (indicative of viral load) in index 
      patients explained 7 to 23% of vaccine-associated reductions in transmission of 
      the two variants. The reductions in transmission of the delta variant declined 
      over time after the second vaccination, reaching levels that were similar to 
      those in unvaccinated persons by 12 weeks in index patients who had received 
      ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and attenuating substantially in those who had received BNT162b2. 
      Protection in contacts also declined in the 3-month period after the second 
      vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination was associated with a smaller reduction in 
      transmission of the delta variant than of the alpha variant, and the effects of 
      vaccination decreased over time. PCR Ct values at diagnosis of the index patient 
      only partially explained decreased transmission. (Funded by the U.K. Government

AB  - Several countries started a 2nd booster COVID-19 vaccination campaign targeting 
      the elderly population, but evidence around its effectiveness is still scarce. 
      This study aims to estimate the relative effectiveness of a 2nd booster dose of 
      COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in the population aged ≥ 80 years in Italy, during 
      predominant circulation of the Omicron BA.2 and BA.5 subvariants. We linked 
      routine data from the national vaccination registry and the COVID-19 surveillance 
      system. On each day between 11 April and 6 August 2022, we matched 1:1, according 
      to several demographic and clinical characteristics, individuals who received the 
      2nd booster vaccine dose with individuals who received the 1st booster vaccine 
      dose at least 120 days earlier. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to compare the 
      risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 (hospitalisation or death) 
      between the two groups, calculating the relative vaccine effectiveness (RVE) as 
      (1 - risk ratio)X100. Based on the analysis of 831,555 matched pairs, we found 
      that a 2nd booster dose of mRNA vaccine, 14-118 days post administration, was 
      moderately effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to a 1st booster 
      dose administered at least 120 days earlier [14.3 %, 95 % confidence interval 
      (CI): 2.2-20.2]. RVE decreased from 28.5 % (95 % CI: 24.7-32.1) in the 
      time-interval 14-28 days to 7.6 % (95 % CI: -14.1 to 18.3) in the time-interval 
      56-118 days. However, RVE against severe COVID-19 was higher (34.0 %, 95 % CI: 
      23.4-42.7), decreasing from 43.2 % (95 % CI: 30.6-54.9) to 27.2 % (95 % CI: 
      8.3-42.9) over the same time span. Although RVE against SARS-CoV-2 infection was 
      much reduced 2-4 months after a 2nd booster dose, RVE against severe COVID-19 was 
      about 30 %, even during prevalent circulation of the Omicron BA.5 subvariant. The 
      cost-benefit of a 3rd booster dose for the elderly people who received the 2nd 
      booster dose at least four months earlier should be carefully evaluated.

TI  - Efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccination in People Living with HIV: A Public Health 
      Fundamental Tool for the Protection of Patients and the Correct Management of 
      Infection.
PG  - 784-793

AB  - HIV/AIDS is considered a risk factor for increased mortality due to COVID-19. For 
      this reason, it is essential to include this population in vaccination campaigns. 
      Studies found that antibodies are lower in HIV+ patients than in healthy 
      individuals. The aim of this study was to assess the immune response in a cohort 
      of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccination in 
      order to evaluate the role played by the HIV infection in the efficacy of this 
      vaccine. We carried out a cross-sectional study in the period April-September 
      2021, involving a cohort of PLWH and a cohort of HIV-uninfected people as the 
      control group. The efficacy of vaccination was high in both groups despite a 
      slight and not significant difference between them. However, important 
      differences were found according to the intensity of the immune response. 
      Specifically, while in the HIV+ group almost a quarter of people had a low 
      response, it is important to remark that the control group had only a high or 
      intermediate response after vaccination. Our results suggest the high efficacy of 
      the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in PLWH and the importance to vaccinate against 
      COVID-19 in these patients in order to increase their protection.

TI  - Association between Influenza vaccination and severity of lung involvement at CT 
      images of the patients with COVID-19 infection: an Iranian retrospective 
      case-control study.
PG  - 221-227
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frequent waves of corona virus disease (COVID-19) and lack of 
      specific drugs against that, warrant studies to reduce the morbidity and 
      mortality of this pandemic disease. In this study, we investigated the 
      association between influenza vaccination and the severity and outcome of 
      COVID-19 disease in Iranian patients living in the North. METHODS: This 
      retrospective case-control study was performed on186 patients with COVID-19 
      infection between March and April, 2020. Patients with positive PCR were divided 
      into two groups of case and control; Patients with moderate to severe and normal 
      to mild lung involvement, respectively. The lung opacities in all of the 5 lobes 
      were evaluated on chest CT images using a CT severity scoring system. The history 
      of influenza vaccination during the fall of 2019-2020 was determined by a phone 
      call. Statistical analysis was done using the chi-square test, student's t-test, 
      and logistic regression. The significance level was p<0.05. RESULTS: The mean age 
      of patients was 54.67±15.05years. Most patients had pulmonary manifestations 
      including ground-glass opacity (57%), consolidation (80%) and pleural effusion 
      (3.2%). Adjusting for age, gender, and history of underlying disease, vaccination 
      is an effective factor in the severity of pulmonary involvement (AOR=0.39; 95%CI: 
      (0.21, 0.73); P=0.003). Furthermore, the chance of ICU admission decreased via 
      influenza vaccination (OR=0.21, P=0.001). CONCLUSION: The results showed that the 
      severity of COVID-19 pulmonary involvement and outcome as ICU admission, and 
      severe symptoms in patients with history of influenza vaccination were 
      significantly lower than those without history of vaccination. This strategy can 
      be used to prevent and reduce the complications of COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of people who experience changes to 
      their menstrual cycle after COVID-19 vaccination. DESIGN: Longitudinal study. 
      PATIENT(S): We recruited a volunteer sample with and without a history of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection who enrolled in the Arizona COVID-19 Cohort (CoVHORT) study 
      and participated in a reproductive sub-cohort who were pre-menopausal, not 
      pregnant, and had received a COVID-19 vaccine in 2021 (n = 545). EXPOSURE(S): 
      Demographic and reproductive characteristics were collected via self-reports. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Information on self-reported changes in the menstrual 
      cycle after COVID-19 vaccination was collected from May 2021 to December 2021. We 
      looked at demographic and reproductive characteristics as predictors of menstrual 
      cycle change. RESULT(S): The majority of our vaccinated sample received the 
      Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (58%), and were 26-35 years old (51%), non-Hispanic 
      (84%), and White (88%). Approximately 25% of vaccinated participants reported a 
      change in their menstrual cycle after vaccination; the majority reported changes 
      after their second dose (56%) as compared with their first (18%) and third (14%) 
      doses. The most commonly reported changes were irregular menstruation (43%), 
      increased premenstrual symptoms (34%), increased menstrual pain or cramps (30%), 
      and abnormally heavy or prolonged bleeding (31%). High self-reported perceived 
      stress levels compared with low perceived stress (OR, 2.22; 95% CI 1.12-4.37) and 
      greater body mass index (OR, 1.04; 95% CI 1.00-1.07) were associated with greater 
      odds of experiencing the menstrual cycle changes after the vaccination. 
      Participants having a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were less likely to report 
      changes in their menstrual cycle after vaccination compared with the participants 
      with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR, 0.58; 95% CI 0.32-1.04). 
      CONCLUSION(S): Among vaccinated participants, approximately 25% of them reported 
      predominantly temporary changes in the menstrual cycle, however, we are unable to 
      determine whether these changes are due to normal cycle variability. The COVID-19 
      vaccines are safe and effective for everyone, including pregnant people and 
      people trying to conceive; hence, these findings should not discourage 
      vaccination.

TI  - Association of COVID-19 Vaccination in Pregnancy With Adverse Peripartum 
      Outcomes.
PG  - 1478-1487
LID - 10.1001/jama.2022.4255 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: There is limited comparative epidemiological evidence on outcomes 
      associated with COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy; monitoring pregnancy 
      outcomes in large populations is required. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate peripartum 
      outcomes following COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: Population-based retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada, 
      using a birth registry linked with the provincial COVID-19 immunization database. 
      All births between December 14, 2020, and September 30, 2021, were included. 
      EXPOSURES: COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy, COVID-19 vaccination after 
      pregnancy, and no vaccination. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Postpartum hemorrhage, 
      chorioamnionitis, cesarean delivery (overall and emergency cesarean delivery), 
      admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and low newborn 5-minute Apgar 
      score (<7). Linear and robust Poisson regression was used to generate adjusted 
      risk differences (aRDs) and risk ratios (aRRs), respectively, comparing 
      cumulative incidence of outcomes in those who received COVID-19 vaccination 
      during pregnancy with those vaccinated after pregnancy and those with no record 
      of COVID-19 vaccination at any point. Inverse probability of treatment weights 
      were used to adjust for confounding. RESULTS: Among 97 590 individuals (mean [SD] 
      age, 31.9 [4.9] years), 22 660 (23%) received at least 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine 
      during pregnancy (63.6% received dose 1 in the third trimester; 99.8% received an 
      mRNA vaccine). Comparing those vaccinated during vs after pregnancy (n = 44 815), 
      there were no significantly increased risks of postpartum hemorrhage (incidence: 
      3.0% vs 3.0%; aRD, -0.28 per 100 individuals [95% CI, -0.59 to 0.03]; aRR, 0.91 
      [95% CI, 0.82-1.02]), chorioamnionitis (0.5% vs 0.5%; aRD, -0.04 per 100 
      individuals [95% CI, -0.17 to 0.09]; aRR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.70-1.21]), cesarean 
      delivery (30.8% vs 32.2%; aRD, -2.73 per 100 individuals [95% CI, -3.59 to 
      -1.88]; aRR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.89-0.95]), NICU admission (11.0% vs 13.3%; aRD, 
      -1.89 per 100 newborns [95% CI, -2.49 to -1.30]; aRR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.80-0.90]), 
      or low Apgar score (1.8% vs 2.0%; aRD, -0.31 per 100 newborns [95% CI, -0.56 to 
      -0.06]; aRR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.73-0.97]). Findings were qualitatively similar when 
      compared with individuals who did not receive COVID-19 vaccination at any point 
      (n = 30 115). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this population-based cohort study in 
      Ontario, Canada, COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy, compared with vaccination 
      after pregnancy and with no vaccination, was not significantly associated with 
      increased risk of adverse peripartum outcomes. Study interpretation should 
      consider that the vaccinations received during pregnancy were primarily mRNA 
      vaccines administered in the second and third trimester.

TI  - Waning of vaccine effectiveness against moderate and severe covid-19 among adults 
      in the US from the VISION network: test negative, case-control study.
PG  - e072141
LID - 10.1136/bmj-2022-072141 [doi]
LID - e072141
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against moderate and 
      severe covid-19 in adults by time since second, third, or fourth doses, and by 
      age and immunocompromised status. DESIGN: Test negative case-control study. 
      SETTING: Hospitals, emergency departments, and urgent care clinics in 10 US 
      states, 17 January 2021 to 12 July 2022. PARTICIPANTS: 893 461 adults (≥18 years) 
      admitted to one of 261 hospitals or to one of 272 emergency department or 119 
      urgent care centers for covid-like illness tested for SARS-CoV-2. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: The main outcome was waning of vaccine effectiveness with BNT162b2 
      (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine during the omicron and delta 
      periods, and the period before delta was dominant using logistic regression 
      conditioned on calendar week and geographic area while adjusting for age, race, 
      ethnicity, local virus circulation, immunocompromised status, and likelihood of 
      being vaccinated. RESULTS: 45 903 people admitted to hospital with covid-19 
      (cases) were compared with 213 103 people with covid-like illness who tested 
      negative for SARS-CoV-2 (controls), and 103 287 people admitted to emergency 
      department or urgent care with covid-19 (cases) were compared with 531 168 people 
      with covid-like illness who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. In the omicron 
      period, vaccine effectiveness against covid-19 requiring admission to hospital 
      was 89% (95% confidence interval 88% to 90%) within two months after dose 3 but 
      waned to 66% (63% to 68%) by four to five months. Vaccine effectiveness of three 
      doses against emergency department or urgent care visits was 83% (82% to 84%) 
      initially but waned to 46% (44% to 49%) by four to five months. Waning was 
      evident in all subgroups, including young adults and individuals who were not 
      immunocompromised; although waning was morein people who were immunocompromised. 
      Vaccine effectiveness increased among most groups after a fourth dose in whom 
      this booster was recommended. CONCLUSIONS: Effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against 
      moderate and severe covid-19 waned with time after vaccination. The findings 
      support recommendations for a booster dose after a primary series and 
      consideration of additional booster doses.

TI  - Association of Prior BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccination With Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 
      Infection in Children and Adolescents During Omicron Predominance.
PG  - 2210-2219
LID - 10.1001/jama.2022.7493 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Efficacy of 2 doses of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine 
      (Pfizer-BioNTech) against COVID-19 was high in pediatric trials conducted before 
      the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant emerged. Among adults, estimated vaccine 
      effectiveness (VE) of 2 BNT162b2 doses against symptomatic Omicron infection was 
      reduced compared with prior variants, waned rapidly, and increased with a 
      booster. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of symptomatic infection with 
      prior vaccination with BNT162b2 to estimate VE among children and adolescents 
      during Omicron variant predominance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 
      test-negative, case-control analysis was conducted using data from 6897 
      pharmacy-based, drive-through SARS-CoV-2 testing sites across the US from a 
      single pharmacy chain in the Increasing Community Access to Testing platform. 
      This analysis included 74 208 tests from children 5 to 11 years of age and 47 744 
      tests from adolescents 12 to 15 years of age with COVID-19-like illness who 
      underwent SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification testing from December 26, 2021, 
      to February 21, 2022. EXPOSURES: Two BNT162b2 doses 2 weeks or more before 
      SARS-CoV-2 testing vs no vaccination for children; 2 or 3 doses 2 weeks or more 
      before testing vs no vaccination for adolescents (who are recommended to receive 
      a booster dose). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Symptomatic infection. The adjusted 
      odds ratio (OR) for the association of prior vaccination and symptomatic 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection was used to estimate VE: VE = (1 - OR) × 100%. RESULTS: A 
      total of 30 999 test-positive cases and 43 209 test-negative controls were 
      included from children 5 to 11 years of age, as well as 22 273 test-positive 
      cases and 25 471 test-negative controls from adolescents 12 to 15 years of age. 
      The median age among those with included tests was 10 years (IQR, 7-13); 61 189 
      (50.2%) were female, 75 758 (70.1%) were White, and 29 034 (25.7%) were 
      Hispanic/Latino. At 2 to 4 weeks after dose 2, among children, the adjusted OR 
      was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.35-0.45; estimated VE, 60.1% [95% CI, 54.7%-64.8%]) and among 
      adolescents, the OR was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.29-0.56; estimated VE, 59.5% [95% CI, 
      44.3%-70.6%]). During month 2 after dose 2, among children, the OR was 0.71 (95% 
      CI, 0.67-0.76; estimated VE, 28.9% [95% CI, 24.5%-33.1%]) and among adolescents, 
      the OR was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.92; estimated VE, 16.6% [95% CI, 8.1%-24.3%]). 
      Among adolescents, the booster dose OR 2 to 6.5 weeks after the dose was 0.29 
      (95% CI, 0.24-0.35; estimated VE, 71.1% [95% CI, 65.5%-75.7%]). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: Among children and adolescents, estimated VE for 2 doses of BNT162b2 
      against symptomatic infection was modest and decreased rapidly. Among 
      adolescents, the estimated effectiveness increased after a booster dose.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about vaccine effectiveness over time among 
      adolescents, especially against the SARS-CoV-2 omicron (B.1.1.529) variant. This 
      study assessed the associations between time since two-dose vaccination with 
      BNT162b2 and the occurrence of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe 
      COVID-19 among adolescents in Brazil and Scotland. METHODS: We did test-negative, 
      case-control studies in adolescents aged 12-17 years with COVID-19-related 
      symptoms in Brazil and Scotland. We linked records of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and 
      antigen tests to national vaccination and clinical records. We excluded tests 
      from individuals who did not have symptoms, were vaccinated before the start of 
      the national vaccination programme, received vaccines other than BNT162b2 or a 
      SARS-CoV-2 booster dose of any kind, or had an interval between their first and 
      second dose of fewer than 21 days. Additionally, we excluded negative SARS-CoV-2 
      tests recorded within 14 days of a previous negative test, negative tests 
      recorded within 7 days after a positive test, any test done within 90 days after 
      a positive test, and tests with missing sex and location information. Cases 
      (SARS-CoV-2 test-positive adolescents) and controls (test-negative adolescents) 
      were drawn from a sample of individuals in whom tests were collected within 10 
      days of symptom onset. We estimated the adjusted odds ratio and vaccine 
      effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 for both countries and against severe 
      COVID-19 (hospitalisation or death) for Brazil across fortnightly periods. 
      FINDINGS: We analysed 503 776 tests from 2 948 538 adolescents in Brazil between 
      Sept 2, 2021, and April 19, 2022, and 127 168 tests from 404 673 adolescents in 
      Scotland between Aug 6, 2021, and April 19, 2022. Vaccine effectiveness peaked at 
      14-27 days after the second dose in both countries during both waves, and was 
      significantly lower against symptomatic infection during the omicron-dominant 
      period in Brazil (64·7% [95% CI 63·0-66·3]) and in Scotland (82·6% [80·6-84·5]), 
      than it was in the delta-dominant period (80·7% [95% CI 77·8-83·3] in Brazil and 
      92·8% [85·7-96·4] in Scotland). Vaccine efficacy started to decline from 27 days 
      after the second dose for both countries, reducing to 5·9% (95% CI 2·2-9·4) in 
      Brazil and 50·6% (42·7-57·4) in Scotland at 98 days or more during the 
      omicron-dominant period. In Brazil, protection against severe disease remained 
      above 80% from 28 days after the second dose and was 82·7% (95% CI 68·8-90·4) at 
      98 days or more after receiving the second dose. INTERPRETATION: We found waning 
      vaccine protection of BNT162b2 against symptomatic COVID-19 infection among 
      adolescents in Brazil and Scotland from 27 days after the second dose. However, 
      protection against severe COVID-19 outcomes remained high at 98 days or more 
      after the second dose in the omicron-dominant period. Booster doses for 
      adolescents need to be considered. FUNDING: UK Research and Innovation (Medical

AB  - Although severe COVID-19 in children is rare, they may develop multisystem 
      inflammatory syndrome, long-COVID and downstream effects of COVID-19, including 
      social isolation and disruption of education. Data on the effectiveness of the 
      CoronaVac vaccine is scarce during the Omicron period. In Brazil, children 
      between 6 to 11 years are eligible to receive the CoronaVac vaccine. We conducted 
      a test-negative design to estimate vaccine effectiveness using 197,958 tests from 
      January 21, 2022, to April 15, 2022, during the Omicron dominant period in Brazil 
      among children aged 6 to 11 years. The estimated vaccine effectiveness for 
      symptomatic infection was 39.8% (95% CI 33.7-45.4) at ≥14 days post-second dose. 
      For hospital admission vaccine effectiveness was 59.2% (95% CI 11.3-84.5) at ≥14 
      days. Two doses of CoronaVac in children during the Omicron period showed low 
      levels of protection against symptomatic infection, and modest levels against 
      severe illness.

      SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Children Aged 5-11 Years and Adolescents Aged 12-15 
      Years - PROTECT Cohort, July 2021-February 2022.
PG  - 422-428
LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm7111e1 [doi]
AB  - The BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was recommended by CDC's 
      Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for persons aged 12-15 years 
      (referred to as adolescents in this report) on May 12, 2021, and for children 
      aged 5-11 years on November 2, 2021 (1-4). Real-world data on vaccine 
      effectiveness (VE) in these age groups are needed, especially because when the 
      B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant became predominant in the United States in December 
      2021, early investigations of VE demonstrated a decline in protection against 
      symptomatic infection for adolescents aged 12-15 years and adults* (5). The 
      PROTECT(†) prospective cohort of 1,364 children and adolescents aged 5-15 years 
      was tested weekly for SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of symptoms, and upon 
      COVID-19-associated illness during July 25, 2021-February 12, 2022. Among 
      unvaccinated participants (i.e., those who had received no COVID-19 vaccine 
      doses) with any laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, those with B.1.617.2 
      (Delta) variant infections were more likely to report COVID-19 symptoms (66%) 
      than were those with Omicron infections (49%). Among fully vaccinated children 
      aged 5-11 years, VE against any symptomatic and asymptomatic Omicron infection 
      14-82 days (the longest interval after dose 2 in this age group) after receipt of 
      dose 2 of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 31% (95% CI = 9%-48%), adjusted for 
      sociodemographic characteristics, health information, frequency of social 
      contact, mask use, location, and local virus circulation. Among adolescents aged 
      12-15 years, adjusted VE 14-149 days after dose 2 was 87% (95% CI = 49%-97%) 
      against symptomatic and asymptomatic Delta infection and 59% (95% CI = 22%-79%) 
      against Omicron infection. Fully vaccinated participants with Omicron infection 
      spent an average of one half day less sick in bed than did unvaccinated 
      participants with Omicron infection. All eligible children and adolescents should 
      remain up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations.

TI  - The Effects of an mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine Booster on Immune Responses in 
      Cancer-Bearing Veterans.
LID - 10.18103/mra.v10i7.2932 [doi]
AB  - Immunocompromised cancer patients are at significant risk of severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. A method to identify 
      those patients at highest risk is needed so that prophylactic measures may be 
      employed. Serum antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are important markers of 
      protection against COVID-19 disease. We evaluated total and neutralizing antibody 
      levels pre and post third booster vaccine and compared responses among different 
      cancer-bearing and healthy veterans. This as a prospective, single site, 
      comparative cohort observational trial. The setting was the West Palm Beach VA 
      Medical Center cancer center. All veterans received a third SARS-CoV-2 mRNA 
      booster. The main outcomes were anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG and neutralizing 
      antibodies to wild-type, and B.1.617, BA1, BA2, and BA4/5 variants were measured. 
      Disease type and therapy, COVID-19 infection, and anti-CD20 antibody treatments 
      were documented. The third mRNA vaccine booster increased the mean blood 
      anti-spike IgG five-fold. The second anti-spike level was equal or greater than 
      the first in 129/140 veterans. All the groups except the myeloma group, had 
      post-booster antibody levels significantly higher than pre-booster with 4-fold, 
      12-fold, 4-fold, 6-fold and 3.5-fold increases for the control, solid tumor, CLL, 
      B cell lymphoma and all B cell malignancy cohorts. The myeloma set showed only a 
      non-significant 1.7-fold increase. Recently anti-CD20 antibody-treated patients 
      were shown to have approximately 200-fold less anti-S IgG production after 
      vaccine booster than other patients. There was a 2.5-fold enhancement of 
      wild-type virus mean neutralizing antibodies after a third mRNA booster and mean 
      neutralization of Delta and Omicron variants increased 2.2, 6.5, 7.7, and 
      6.2-fold versus pre-boost levels. B cell malignancies failed to show increased 
      post-booster neutralization. The third SARS CoV-2 booster increased total 
      anti-spike IgG and neutralizing antibodies for most subjects. Veterans with B 
      cell malignancies particularly myeloma and those receiving anti-CD20 monoclonal 
      antibodies had the weakest humoral responses. Neutralizing antibody responses to 
      Omicron variants were less than for wild-type virus. A subset of patients without 
      humoral immunity post-booster should be considered for prophylactic antibody or 
      close monitoring.

TI  - Patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Have a Very High Risk of Ineffective 
      Response to the BNT162b2 Vaccine.
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10071162 [doi]
LID - 1162
AB  - Patients with CLL have high rates of either severe disease or death from COVID-19 
      and a low response rate after COVID-19 vaccination has been reported. We 
      conducted a single-center study with the main objective to evaluate the 
      immunogenicity of the BNT1162b2 mRNA vaccines in 42 patients affected by CLL with 
      the assessment of antibody response after the second and the third dose. After 
      the second dose of vaccine, 13 patients (30%) showed an antibody response. The 
      presence of hypogammaglobulinemia and the use of steroids or IVIG were the main 
      factors associated with poor response. After the third dose, 5/27 (18%) patients 
      showed an antibody response while in non-responders to the second dose, only 1 
      patient (4%) showed an elicitation of the immune response by the third dose, with 
      no statistically significant difference. Our data, despite the small size of our 
      cohort, demonstrate that patients with CLL have a low rate of effective response 
      to the BNT162b2 vaccine. However, the effective role of a subsequent dose is 
      still unclear, highlighting the need for alternative methods of immunization in 
      this particularly fragile group of patients.

TI  - BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine Effectiveness Given Confirmed Exposure: Analysis of 
      Household Members of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients.
PG  - e734-e740
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciab973 [doi]
LID - ciab973
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although BNT162b2 vaccine-efficacy analyses have been published, the 
      effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing coronavirus disease 2019 given 
      confirmed exposure has not been previously demonstrated, even though it has 
      policy implications, such as the need for self-quarantine when exposure has 
      occurred. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, we used data collected 
      between 20 December 2020 and 17 March 2021 from the second largest healthcare 
      provider in Israel to analyze the probability of an additional household 
      infection occurring within 10 days after an index infection. In model 1, vaccine 
      effectiveness was described for Fully Vaccinated individuals (7 or more days from 
      second dose) vs either Unvaccinated individuals or those Recently Vaccinated Once 
      (0-7 days from the first dose, presumably still unprotected). Secondary analyses 
      included correction for differing testing rates. In model 2, we conducted a 
      separate analysis of households comprised of only adults with the same 
      vaccination status. RESULTS: A total of 173 569 households were included, of 
      which 6351 had an index infection (mean [standard deviation] age, 58.9 [13.5] 
      years); 50% were women. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness of Fully Vaccinated 
      compared with Unvaccinated participants was 80.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
      73.5-85.4) and 82.0% (95% CI, 75.6-86.8) compared with those Recently Vaccinated 
      Once. CONCLUSIONS: The BNT162b2 vaccine is effective in high-risk real-life 
      exposure scenarios, but the protection afforded in these settings is lower than 
      that previously described. Individuals with a confirmed significant exposure to 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome are still at risk of being infected even if 
      fully vaccinated.

      an omicron dominant period in Israel. PARTICIPANTS: 97 499 Maccabi Healthcare 
      Services members aged 60 years and older, who were eligible to receive a fourth 
      vaccine dose and obtained at least one polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test 
      during the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
      defined as a positive PCR test performed seven or more days after inoculation 
      with the BNT162b2 vaccine; and breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in 
      severe covid-19 disease, defined as hospital admission or death related to 
      covid-19. RESULTS: 27 876 participants received the fourth BNT162b2 vaccine dose 
      and 69 623 received three doses only. Of 106 participants who died during the 
      follow-up period, 77 had had their third doses only and 23 had had their fourth 
      doses during the first three weeks after inoculation. In the first three weeks, a 
      fourth dose provided additional protection against both SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
      severe disease relative to three doses of the vaccine. However, relative vaccine 
      effectiveness against infection quickly decreased over time, peaking during the 
      third week at 65.1% (95% confidence interval 63.0% to 67.1%) and falling to 22.0% 
      (4.9% to 36.1%) by the end of the 10 week follow-up period. Unlike relative 
      effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection, the relative effectiveness of a 
      fourth dose against severe covid-19 was maintained at a high level (>72%) 
      throughout follow-up. However, severe disease was a relatively rare event, 
      occurring in <1% of study participants who received four doses or three doses 
      only. CONCLUSIONS: A fourth dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine appears to have provided 
      additional protection against both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe covid-19 
      disease relative to three vaccine doses. However, relative effectiveness of the 
      fourth dose against infection appears to wane sooner than that of the third dose.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Randomized controlled trials have shown that mRNA vaccines 
      are highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV2 infection. We conducted a study to 
      assess the real-world effectiveness of mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) 
      in preventing all and symptomatic SARS-CoV2 infections and COVID-19 related 
      hospitalizations in the staff of the Bologna Health Trust (HT), Italy Methods: We 
      followed up retrospectively 9839 staff of the Bologna HT from December 27, 2020 
      to April 3, 2020 and calculated the effectiveness in partially and fully 
      vaccinated subjects by applying a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model. 
      RESULTS: Vaccine effectiveness in preventing SARS-CoV2 infections is 85.5% 
      (95%CI: 75.9-91.3) in the partially vaccinated and 84.8% (95%CI: 73.2-91.4) in 
      the fully vaccinated. In preventing symptomatic infection effectiveness is 81.7% 
      (95%CI: 62.7-91.0) in the partially and 87.1% (95%CI: 69.3-94.6) in the fully 
      vaccinated. There were no COVID-19-related hospitalizations in the partially or 
      fully vaccinated vs 15 hospitalization in the unvaccinated cohort. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our results confirm the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines in a real-world setting in 
      Northern Italy.

TI  - Who is protected? Determinants of hepatitis B infant vaccination completion among 
      a prospective cohort of migrant workers in Thailand during the COVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - 190
LID - 10.1186/s12939-022-01802-5 [doi]
LID - 190
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B causes significant disease and death globally, despite 
      the availability of effective vaccination. Migration likewise affects hundreds of 
      millions of people annually, many of whom are women and children, and increases 
      risks for poor vaccine completion and mother to child transmission of hepatitis 
      B. In the neighbouring countries of Thailand and Myanmar, vaccine campaigns have 
      made progress but little is known about the reach of these programs into migrant 
      worker communities from Myanmar living in Thailand. METHODS: A cohort of 253 
      postpartum women (53 urban migrants in Chiang Mai and 200 rural migrants in Tak 
      Province) were surveyed about their Hepatitis B knowledge and willingness to 
      vaccinate their children between September 10, 2019 and March 30, 2019. They were 
      subsequently followed to determine vaccine completion. When records of 
      vaccination were unavailable at the birth facility, or visits were late, families 
      were contacted and interviewed about vaccination elsewhere, and reasons for late 
      or missed vaccines. RESULTS: Though women in Tak province displayed better 
      knowledge of Hepatitis B and equal intention to vaccinate, they were 14 times 
      less likely to complete Hepatitis B vaccination for their children compared to 
      migrants in Chiang Mai. Tak women were largely undocumented, had private 
      (non-profit) insurance and had more transient residence. In Chiang Mai migrant 
      women were mostly documented and had full access to the Thai national health 
      services. Though minor individual and facility-level differences may have 
      contributed, the major driver of the disparity seems to be the place of migrants 
      within local socio-political-economic systems. The COVID-19 pandemic further 
      disproportionately affected Tak province migrants who faced severe travel 
      restrictions hampering vaccination. Sixty percent of families who were lost to 
      vaccine follow-up in Tak province could not be contacted by phone or home visit. 
      Chiang Mai migrants, with 86.8% vaccine completion, nearly reached the target of 
      90%. CONCLUSIONS: Achievement of high levels of hepatitis B vaccination in 
      migrant communities is important and feasible, and requires inclusive policies 
      that integrate migrants into national health and social services. This is more 
      urgent than ever during the COVID-19 era.

TI  - Reduction in COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 Variants in Seoul 
      according to Age, Sex, and Symptoms: A Test-Negative Case-Control Study.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph192416958 [doi]
LID - 16958
AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infections with 
      SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in Seoul, the capital of the Republic of Korea, 
      having the highest population density in the country, under real-world 
      conditions. METHODS: We evaluated the reduction in the effectiveness of mRNA and 
      viral-vector COVID-19 vaccines against infection by the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant 
      in a subpopulation from April 2021 to July 2021 who visited screening clinics in 
      Seoul using a test-negative case-control study design. Moreover, we conducted a 
      case-control study matching the ten-year-old age group, sex, healthcare workers, 
      and five districts of Seoul, which are considered confounding factors. RESULTS: 
      The full VE in the pre-delta-dominant period was 95.0% (95% confidence interval 
      [CI]: 91.2-97.2); however, it decreased to 61.1% (95% CI: 53.2-67.6) during the 
      delta-dominant period. Notably, we found that COVID-19 VE was significantly 
      decreased in individuals aged ≥80 years (52.9%, 95% CI: -9.9-79.8), men (50.6 %, 
      95% CI: 39.4-59.8), and asymptomatic individuals (49.8%, 95% CI: 36.5-60.3) 
      during the widespread SARS-CoV-2 delta variant circulation. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Vaccine-mediated protection drastically declined during the delta-dominant period 
      and in vulnerable groups. This study suggests the requirement for additional 
      countermeasures, such as the administration of a booster vaccine, in vulnerable 
      groups based on age, sex, and symptomatic manifestation.

TI  - Assessing COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake and Effectiveness Through the North West London 
      Vaccination Program: Retrospective Cohort Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared SARS-CoV-2, 
      causing COVID-19, as a pandemic. The UK mass vaccination program commenced on 
      December 8, 2020, vaccinating groups of the population deemed to be most 
      vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infection. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the 
      early vaccine administration coverage and outcome data across an integrated care 
      system in North West London, leveraging a unique population-level care data set. 
      Vaccine effectiveness of a single dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca and 
      Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines were compared. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study 
      identified 2,183,939 individuals eligible for COVID-19 vaccination between 
      December 8, 2020, and February 24, 2021, within a primary, secondary, and 
      community care integrated care data set. These data were used to assess 
      vaccination hesitancy across ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic deprivation 
      measures (Pearson product-moment correlations); investigate COVID-19 transmission 
      related to vaccination hubs; and assess the early effectiveness of COVID-19 
      vaccination (after a single dose) using time-to-event analyses with multivariable 
      Cox regression analysis to investigate if vaccination independently predicted 
      positive SARS-CoV-2 in those vaccinated compared to those unvaccinated. RESULTS: 
      In this study, 5.88% (24,332/413,919) of individuals declined and did not receive 
      a vaccination. Black or Black British individuals had the highest rate of 
      declining a vaccine at 16.14% (4337/26,870). There was a strong negative 
      association between socioeconomic deprivation and rate of declining vaccination 
      (r=-0.94; P=.002) with 13.5% (1980/14,571) of individuals declining vaccination 
      in the most deprived areas compared to 0.98% (869/9609) in the least. In the 
      first 6 days after vaccination, 344 of 389,587 (0.09%) individuals tested 
      positive for SARS-CoV-2. The rate increased to 0.13% (525/389,243) between days 7 
      and 13, before then gradually falling week on week. At 28 days post vaccination, 
      there was a 74% (hazard ratio 0.26, 95% CI 0.19-0.35) and 78% (hazard ratio 0.22, 
      95% CI 0.18-0.27) reduction in risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 for 
      individuals that received the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, 
      respectively, when compared with unvaccinated individuals. A very low proportion 
      of hospital admissions were seen in vaccinated individuals who tested positive 
      for SARS-CoV-2 (288/389,587, 0.07% of all patients vaccinated) providing evidence 
      for vaccination effectiveness after a single dose. CONCLUSIONS: There was no 
      definitive evidence to suggest COVID-19 was transmitted as a result of 
      vaccination hubs during the vaccine administration rollout in North West London, 
      and the risk of contracting COVID-19 or becoming hospitalized after vaccination 
      has been demonstrated to be low in the vaccinated population. This study provides 
      further evidence that a single dose of either the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine or the 
      Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is effective at reducing the risk of testing positive 
      for COVID-19 up to 60 days across all age groups, ethnic groups, and risk 
      categories in an urban UK population.

TI  - Testing behaviour may bias observational studies of vaccine effectiveness.
PG  - 242-246
LID - 10.3138/jammi-2022-0002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent observational studies suggest that vaccines may have little 
      effect in preventing infection with the Omicron variant of severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. However, the observed effects may be 
      confounded by patient factors, preventive behaviours, or differences in testing 
      behaviour. To assess potential confounding, we examined differences in testing 
      behaviour between unvaccinated and vaccinated populations. METHODS: We recruited 
      1,526 Australian adults for an online randomized study about coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) testing in late 2021, collecting self-reported vaccination status 
      and three measures of COVID-19 testing behaviour: testing in past month or ever 
      and test intention if they woke with a sore throat. We examined the association 
      between testing intentions and vaccination status in the trial's baseline data. 
      RESULTS: Of the 1,526 participants (mean age 31 y), 22% had a COVID-19 test in 
      the past month and 61% ever; 17% were unvaccinated, 11% were partially vaccinated 
      (one dose), and 71% were fully vaccinated (two or more doses). Fully vaccinated 
      participants were twice as likely as those who were unvaccinated (relative risk 
      [RR] 2.2, 95% CI 1.8 to 2.8, p < 0.001) to report positive COVID testing 
      intentions. Partially vaccinated participants had less positive intentions than 
      fully vaccinated participants (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.89, p < 0.001) but 
      higher intentions than unvaccinated participants (RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.4 to 1.6, p = 
      0.002). DISCUSSION: Vaccination predicted greater COVID-19 testing intentions and 
      would substantially bias observed vaccine effectiveness. To account for 
      differential testing behaviours, test-negative designs are currently the 
      preferred option, but their assumptions need more thorough examination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The rapid vaccination campaign against COVID-19 in Israel relied on 
      the BNT162b2 vaccine. We performed a longitudinal analysis of multiple cohorts, 
      using individual data, to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine against new 
      and breakthrough cases. METHODS: We estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) for 27 
      consecutive cohorts, each comprised of individuals vaccinated on specific days. 
      VE against new COVID-19 cases was evaluated for five SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes: 
      infection, symptomatic disease, hospitalisation, severe/critical disease and 
      death. For breakthrough cases, rate reduction was evaluated for hospitalisation, 
      severe/critical disease and death. Outcomes were evaluated at predetermined 
      time-periods after vaccination, the last one dedicated to individuals who became 
      SARS-CoV-2-positive 22-28 days after the second dose. FINDINGS: The highest VE 
      estimates against new cases in ≥16 year old individuals, for all outcomes, were 
      reached at the 15-21 day period after the second dose, ranging between 97.7% (95% 
      CI: 95.9-98.7%) for deaths and 98.6% (95% CI: 97.8-99.1%) for severe/critical 
      disease. VE estimates of the 14-20 day period after the first dose ranged between 
      54.3% (95% CI: 50.6-57.8%) for infection and 77.3% (95% CI: 71.2-82.1%) for 
      severe/critical disease. VE rose more slowly among ≥80 year old individuals. Rate 
      reductions of breakthrough complications were highest at the 22-28 day period 
      after the second dose, ranging between 47.4% (95% CI: 4.3-71.2%) for death and 
      66.2% (95% CI: 44.2-79.6%) for severe/critical disease. INTERPRETATION: The 
      BNT162 vaccine is highly effective in preventing new SARS-CoV-2 cases. Among ≥80 
      year old individuals, high effectiveness develops more slowly. In breakthrough 
      cases, vaccination reduces complications and death. FUNDING: None.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In early 2020, the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began to spread around 
      the world and claim victims. Initially, in the Western world, COVID-19-related 
      mortality was due to illness in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). To manage the 
      COVID-19 crisis in LTCFs in Israel, the Ministry of Health established a task 
      force named "Senior Shield." The task force executed a screening program of 
      weekly polymerase chain reaction (PCR) SARS-CoV-2 tests for LTCF residents and 
      caregivers, and at a later stage, the task force led the Ministry of Health 
      vaccination program at LTCFs. This study aimed to estimate the effectiveness of 
      the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 (Comirnaty) vaccine in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and 
      mortality in LTCF residents. METHODS: We designed a nationwide cohort study 
      utilizing data from the Senior Shield task force. Residents had received the 
      vaccines starting December 2020. The study follow-up period was 5 months (ending 
      May 2021). We defined four outcomes: (a) documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined 
      by a positive PCR test, (b) COVID-19 death, defined by a positive PCR test 
      followed by death, (c) all-cause mortality, defined as death regardless of the 
      result of a PCR test, and (d) a composite endpoint which included documented 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection or death, the earliest of both. We used Kaplan-Meier curves 
      with a log-rank comparison and Cox regression with a time-dependent covariate 
      model to estimate adjusted hazard ratios for vaccine effectiveness (VE). The 
      index date was the date of the first vaccine dose. In unvaccinated residents, the 
      index date was the first date of vaccination in their LTCF. RESULTS: A total of 
      43,596 residents with a mean age of 83 years living in 454 LTCFs were found 
      eligible for this study. Ninety-one percent of the study population received the 
      first vaccine dose (39,482) and 86% received the second vaccine dose (37,656). 
      Estimated VE 28 days after the first vaccine dose (approximately 7 days after the 
      second vaccine dose) was 81.2% for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 85.3% for COVID-related 
      death, 63.7% for all-cause mortality, and 71.1% for the composite endpoint 
      (SARS-CoV-2 infection or death). CONCLUSION: This study shows that the BNT162b2 
      mRNA COVID-19 vaccine effectively prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related 
      death, and all-cause mortality in LTCF residents. Further research is warranted 
      on the effect of the third vaccine (booster) in this population.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Data on BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) 
      effectiveness and safety in pregnancy are currently lacking because pregnant 
      women were excluded from the phase 3 trial. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association 
      between receipt of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among 
      pregnant women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a retrospective 
      cohort study within the pregnancy registry of a large state-mandated health care 
      organization in Israel. Pregnant women vaccinated with a first dose from December 
      19, 2020, through February 28, 2021, were 1:1 matched to unvaccinated women by 
      age, gestational age, residential area, population subgroup, parity, and 
      influenza immunization status. Follow-up ended on April 11, 2021. EXPOSURES: 
      Exposure was defined by receipt of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. To maintain 
      comparability, nonexposed women who were subsequently vaccinated were censored 10 
      days after their exposure, along with their matched pair. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: The primary outcome was polymerase chain reaction-validated SARS-CoV-2 
      infection at 28 days or more after the first vaccine dose. RESULTS: The cohort 
      included 7530 vaccinated and 7530 matched unvaccinated women, 46% and 33% in the 
      second and third trimester, respectively, with a mean age of 31.1 years (SD, 4.9 
      years). The median follow-up for the primary outcome was 37 days (interquartile 
      range, 21-54 days; range, 0-70). There were 118 SARS-CoV-2 infections in the 
      vaccinated group and 202 in the unvaccinated group. Among infected women, 88 of 
      105 (83.8%) were symptomatic in the vaccinated group vs 149 of 179 (83.2%) in the 
      unvaccinated group (P ≥ .99). During 28 to 70 days of follow-up, there were 10 
      infections in the vaccinated group and 46 in the unvaccinated group. The hazards 
      of infection were 0.33% vs 1.64% in the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, 
      respectively, representing an absolute difference of 1.31% (95% CI, 0.89%-1.74%), 
      with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.22 (95% CI, 0.11-0.43). Vaccine-related 
      adverse events were reported by 68 patients; none was severe. The most commonly 
      reported symptoms were headache (n = 10, 0.1%), general weakness (n = 8, 0.1%), 
      nonspecified pain (n = 6, <0.1%), and stomachache (n = 5, <0.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: In this retrospective cohort study of pregnant women, BNT162b2 mRNA 
      vaccination compared with no vaccination was associated with a significantly 
      lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interpretation of study findings is limited 
      by the observational design.

      Early Infant Outcomes.
PG  - 470-477

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Pregnant women were excluded from the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) 
      COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) preauthorization trial. Therefore, 
      observational data on vaccine safety for prenatally exposed newborns are critical 
      to inform recommendations on maternal immunization. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether 
      BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination during pregnancy is associated with adverse neonatal 
      and early infant outcomes among the newborns. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      Population-based cohort study comprising all singleton live births in March 
      through September 2021, within a large state-mandated health care organization in 
      Israel, followed up until October 31, 2021. EXPOSURE: Maternal BNT162b2 mRNA 
      vaccination during pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk ratios (RR) of 
      preterm birth, small birth weight for gestational age (SGA), congenital 
      malformations, all-cause hospitalizations, and infant death. Stabilized inverse 
      probability weighting was used to adjust for maternal age, timing of conception, 
      parity, socioeconomic status, population subgroup, and maternal influenza 
      immunization status. RESULTS: The cohort included 24 288 eligible newborns (49% 
      female, 96% born at ≥37 weeks' gestation), of whom 16 697 were exposed (n = 2134 
      and n = 9364 in the first and second trimesters, respectively) to maternal 
      vaccination in utero. Median (IQR) follow-up after birth was 126 days (76-179) 
      among exposed and 152 days (88-209) among unexposed newborns. No substantial 
      differences were observed in preterm birth rates between exposed and unexposed 
      newborns (RR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.83-1.10) or SGA (RR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87-1.08). No 
      significant differences were observed in the incidence of all-cause neonatal 
      hospitalizations (RR = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.88-1.12), postneonatal hospitalizations 
      after birth (RR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.84-1.07), congenital anomalies (RR = 0.69; 95% 
      CI, 0.44-1.04), or infant mortality over the study period (RR = 0.84; 95% CI, 
      0.43-1.72). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This large population-based study found no 
      evident differences between newborns of women who received BNT162b2 mRNA 
      vaccination during pregnancy, vs those of women who were not vaccinated, and 
      contributes to current evidence in establishing the safety of prenatal vaccine 
      exposure to the newborns. Interpretation of study findings is limited by the 
      observational design.

LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2022.6815 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Patients with cancer are known to have increased risk of COVID-19 
      complications, including death. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of 
      COVID-19 vaccination with breakthrough infections and complications in patients 
      with cancer compared to noncancer controls. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      Retrospective population-based cohort study using linked administrative databases 
      in Ontario, Canada, in residents 18 years and older who received COVID-19 
      vaccination. Three matched groups were identified (based on age, sex, type of 
      vaccine, date of vaccine): 1:4 match for patients with hematologic and solid 
      cancer to noncancer controls (hematologic and solid cancers separately analyzed), 
      1:1 match between patients with hematologic and patients with solid cancer. 
      EXPOSURES: Cancer diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes occurring 14 
      days after receipt of second COVID-19 vaccination dose: primary outcome was 
      SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection; secondary outcomes were emergency department 
      visit, hospitalization, and death within 4 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection (end of 
      follow-up March 31, 2022). Multivariable cumulative incidence function models 
      were used to obtain adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: A total of 
      289 400 vaccinated patients with cancer (39 880 hematologic; 249 520 solid) with 
      1 157 600 matched noncancer controls were identified; the cohort was 65.4% 
      female, and mean (SD) age was 66 (14.0) years. SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection 
      was higher in patients with hematologic cancer (aHR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.20-1.46; 
      P < .001) but not in patients with solid cancer (aHR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.96-1.05; 
      P = .87). COVID-19 severe outcomes (composite of hospitalization and death) were 
      significantly higher in patients with cancer compared to patients without cancer 
      (aHR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.42-1.63; P < .001). Risk of severe outcomes was higher 
      among patients with hematologic cancer (aHR, 2.51; 95% CI, 2.21-2.85; P < .001) 
      than patients with solid cancer (aHR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.24-1.64; P < .001). 
      Patients receiving active treatment had a further heightened risk for COVID-19 
      severe outcomes, particularly those who received anti-CD20 therapy. Third 
      vaccination dose was associated with lower infection and COVID-19 complications, 
      except for patients receiving anti-CD20 therapy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In 
      this large population-based cohort study, patients with cancer had greater risk 
      of SARS-CoV-2 infection and worse outcomes than patients without cancer, and the 
      risk was highest for patients with hematologic cancer and any patients with 
      cancer receiving active treatment. Triple vaccination was associated with lower 
      risk of poor outcomes.

TI  - Collaboration between the Fab and Fc contribute to maximal protection against 
      SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates following NVX-CoV2373 subunit vaccine with 
      Matrix-M™ vaccination.

AB  - Recently approved vaccines have already shown remarkable protection in limiting 
      SARS-CoV-2 associated disease. However, immunologic mechanism(s) of protection, 
      as well as how boosting alters immunity to wildtype and newly emerging strains, 
      remain incompletely understood. Here we deeply profiled the humoral immune 
      response in a cohort of non-human primates immunized with a stable recombinant 
      full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein (NVX-CoV2373) at two dose levels, 
      administered as a single or two-dose regimen with a saponin-based adjuvant 
      Matrix-M™. While antigen dose had some effect on Fc-effector profiles, both 
      antigen dose and boosting significantly altered overall titers, neutralization 
      and Fc-effector profiles, driving unique vaccine-induced antibody fingerprints. 
      Combined differences in antibody effector functions and neutralization were 
      strongly associated with distinct levels of protection in the upper and lower 
      respiratory tract, pointing to the presence of combined, but distinct, 
      compartment-specific neutralization and Fc-mechanisms as key determinants of 
      protective immunity against infection. Moreover, NVX-CoV2373 elicited antibodies 
      functionally target emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, collectively pointing to the 
      critical collaborative role for Fab and Fc in driving maximal protection against 
      SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, the data presented here suggest that a single dose may 
      prevent disease, but that two doses may be essential to block further 
      transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants. HIGHLIGHTS: NVX-CoV2373 subunit 
      vaccine elicits receptor blocking, virus neutralizing antibodies, and Fc-effector 
      functional antibodies.The vaccine protects against respiratory tract infection 
      and virus shedding in non-human primates (NHPs).Both neutralizing and Fc-effector 
      functions contribute to protection, potentially through different mechanisms in 
      the upper and lower respiratory tract.Both macaque and human vaccine-induced 
      antibodies exhibit altered Fc-receptor binding to emerging mutants.

TI  - Serologic Status and Toxic Effects of the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 Vaccine in Patients 
      Undergoing Treatment for Cancer.
PG  - 1507-1513
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2021.2675 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The efficacy and safety profile of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been 
      acquired from phase 3 studies; however, patients with cancer were not represented 
      in these trials. Owing to the recommendation to prioritize high-risk populations 
      for vaccination, further data are warranted. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use and 
      safety of the BNT162b2 vaccine in patients undergoing treatment for cancer. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In January 2021, mass SARS-CoV-2 vaccination 
      of high-risk populations, including patients with cancer, was initiated in 
      Israel. This cohort study prospectively enrolled and followed up patients with 
      cancer and healthy participants between January 15 and March 14, 2021. The study 
      was conducted at the Division of Oncology of Rambam Health Care Campus, the major 
      tertiary (referral) medical center of northern Israel. Participants included 232 
      patients with cancer who were receiving active treatment after the first and 
      second doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine and 261 healthy, age-matched health care 
      workers who served as controls. EXPOSURES: Serum samples were collected after 
      each vaccine dose and in cases of seronegativity. Questionnaires regarding 
      sociodemographic characteristics and adverse reactions were administered at serum 
      collection. A regulatory agencies-approved assay was used to assess IgG at all 
      time points. Patients' electronic medical records were reviewed for documentation 
      of COVID-19 infection and results of blood cell counts, liver enzyme levels, and 
      imaging studies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Seroconversion rate after the first 
      and second doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine and documented COVID-19 infection. 
      RESULTS: Of the 232 patients undergoing treatment for cancer, 132 were men (57%); 
      mean (SD) age was 66 (12.09) years. After the first dose of BNT162b2 vaccine, 29% 
      (n = 25) patients were seropositive compared with 84% (n = 220) of the controls 
      (P < .001). After the second dose, the seropositive rate reached 86% (n = 187) in 
      the patients. Testing rate ratios per 1000 person-days after the first dose were 
      12.5 (95% CI, 3.4-45.7) for the patients and 48.5 (95% CI, 37.2-63.2) for the 
      controls. Patients undergoing chemotherapy showed reduced immunogenicity (odds 
      ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17-0.98). In seronegative patients, the rate of documented 
      absolute leukopenia reached 39%. No COVID-19 cases were documented throughout the 
      study period; however, 2 cases in the patient cohort were noted immediately after 
      the first dose. Reported adverse events were similar to data in former trials 
      comprising mostly healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort 
      study, the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine appeared to be safe and achieve 
      satisfactory serologic status in patients with cancer. There was a pronounced lag 
      in antibody production compared with the rate in noncancer controls; however, 
      seroconversion occurred in most patients after the second dose. Future real-world 
      data are warranted to determine the long-term efficacy of the vaccine with regard 
      to type of anticancer treatment.

TI  - Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and death 
      when combining a first dose ChAdOx1 vaccine with a subsequent mRNA vaccine in 
      Denmark: A nationwide population-based cohort study.
PG  - e1003874
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1003874 [doi]
LID - e1003874
AB  - BACKGROUND: The recommendations in several countries to stop using the ChAdOx1 
      vaccine has led to vaccine programs combining different Coronavirus Disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) vaccine types, which necessitates knowledge on vaccine effectiveness 
      (VE) of heterologous vaccine schedules. The aim of this Danish nationwide 
      population-based cohort study was therefore to estimate the VE against Severe 
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and 
      COVID-19-related hospitalization and death following the first dose of the 
      ChAdOx1 vaccine and the combination of the ChAdOx1/mRNA vaccines. METHODS AND 
      FINDINGS: All individuals alive in or immigrating to Denmark from 9 February 2021 
      to 23 June 2021 were identified in the Danish Civil Registration System. 
      Information on exposure, outcomes, and covariates was obtained from Danish 
      national registries. Poisson and Cox regression models were used to calculate 
      crude and adjusted VE, respectively, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
      against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization or death 
      comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals. The VE estimates were 
      adjusted for calendar time as underlying time and for sex, age, comorbidity, 
      country of origin, and hospital admission. The analyses included 5,542,079 
      individuals (97.6% of the total Danish population). A total of 144,360 
      individuals were vaccinated with the ChAdOx1 vaccine as the first dose, and of 
      these, 136,551 individuals received an mRNA vaccine as the second dose. A total 
      of 1,691,464 person-years and 83,034 SARS-CoV-2 infections were included. The 
      individuals vaccinated with the first dose of the ChAdOx1 vaccine dose had a 
      median age of 45 years. The study population was characterized by an equal 
      distribution of males and females; 6.7% and 9.2% originated from high-income and 
      other countries, respectively. The VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection when combining 
      the ChAdOx1 and an mRNA vaccine was 88% (95% CI: 83; 92) 14 days after the second 
      dose and onwards. There were no COVID-19-related hospitalizations or deaths among 
      the individuals vaccinated with the combined vaccine schedule during the study 
      period. Study limitations including unmeasured confounders such as risk behavior 
      and increasing overall vaccine coverage in the general population creating herd 
      immunity are important to take into consideration when interpreting the results. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed a large reduction in the risk of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection when combining the ChAdOx1 and an mRNA vaccine, compared 
      with unvaccinated individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The continued occurrence of more contagious Severe Acute Respiratory 
      Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants and waning immunity over time 
      require ongoing reevaluation of the vaccine effectiveness (VE). This study aimed 
      to estimate the effectiveness in 2 age groups (12 to 59 and 60 years or above) of 
      2 or 3 vaccine doses (BNT162b2 mRNA or mRNA-1273) by time since vaccination 
      against SARS-CoV-2 infection and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      hospitalization in an Alpha-, Delta-, or Omicron-dominated period. METHODS AND 
      FINDINGS: A Danish nationwide cohort study design was used to estimate VE against 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization with the Alpha, Delta, or 
      Omicron variant. Information was obtained from nationwide registries and linked 
      using a unique personal identification number. The study included all previously 
      uninfected residents in Denmark aged 12 years or above (18 years or above for the 
      analysis of 3 doses) in the Alpha (February 20 to June 15, 2021), Delta (July 4 
      to November 20, 2021), and Omicron (December 21, 2021 to January 31, 2022) 
      dominated periods. VE estimates including 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 
      calculated (1-hazard ratio∙100) using Cox proportional hazard regression models 
      with underlying calendar time and adjustments for age, sex, comorbidity, and 
      geographical region. Vaccination status was included as a time-varying exposure. 
      In the oldest age group, VE against infection after 2 doses was 90.7% (95% CI: 
      88.2; 92.7) for the Alpha variant, 82.3% (95% CI: 75.5; 87.2) for the Delta 
      variant, and 39.9% (95% CI: 26.3; 50.9) for the Omicron variant 14 to 30 days 
      since vaccination. The VE waned over time and was 73.2% (Alpha, 95% CI: 57.1; 
      83.3), 50.0% (Delta, 95% CI: 46.7; 53.0), and 4.4% (Omicron, 95% CI: -0.1; 8.7) 
      >120 days since vaccination. Higher estimates were observed after the third dose 
      with VE estimates against infection of 86.1% (Delta, 95% CI: 83.3; 88.4) and 
      57.7% (Omicron, 95% CI: 55.9; 59.5) 14 to 30 days since vaccination. Among both 
      age groups, VE against COVID-19 hospitalization 14 to 30 days since vaccination 
      with 2 or 3 doses was 98.1% or above for the Alpha and Delta variants. Among both 
      age groups, VE against COVID-19 hospitalization 14 to 30 days since vaccination 
      with 2 or 3 doses was 95.5% or above for the Omicron variant. The main limitation 
      of this study is the nonrandomized study design including potential differences 
      between the unvaccinated (reference group) and vaccinated individuals. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Two vaccine doses provided high protection against SARS-CoV-2 
      infection and COVID-19 hospitalization with the Alpha and Delta variants with 
      protection, notably against infection, waning over time. Two vaccine doses 
      provided only limited and short-lived protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      with Omicron. However, the protection against COVID-19 hospitalization following 
      Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher. The third vaccine dose substantially 
      increased the level and duration of protection against infection with the Omicron 
      variant and provided a high level of sustained protection against COVID-19 
      hospitalization among the +60-year-olds.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the settings and activities associated with 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant circulation in 
      France, as well as the protection against symptomatic Delta infection. METHODS: 
      In this nationwide case-control study, cases were SARS-CoV-2 infected adults 
      recruited between 23 May and 13 August 2021. Controls were non-infected adults 
      from a national representative panel matched to cases by age, sex, region, 
      population density and calendar week. Participants completed an online 
      questionnaire and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to 
      determine the association between acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and recent 
      activity-related exposures, past history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and COVID-19 
      vaccination. FINDINGS: We did not find any differences in the settings and 
      activities associated with Delta versus non-Delta infections and grouped them for 
      subsequent analyses. In multivariable analysis involving 12634 cases (8644 Delta 
      and 3990 non-Delta) and 5560 controls, we found individuals under 40 years and 
      attending bars (aOR:1.9; 95%CI:1.6-2.2) or parties (aOR:3.4; 95%CI:2.8-4.2) to be 
      at increased risk of infection. In those aged 40 years and older, having children 
      attend daycare (aOR:1.9; 95%CI:1.1-3.3), kindergarten (aOR:1.6; 95%CI:1.2-2.1), 
      primary school (aOR:1.4; 95%CI:1.2-1.6) or middle school (aOR:1.3; 95%CI:1.2-1.6) 
      were associated with increased risk of infection. We found strong protection 
      against symptomatic Delta infection for those with prior infection whether it was 
      recent (2-6 months) (95%; 95%CI:90-97) or associated with one dose (85%; 
      95%CI:78-90) or two doses of mRNA vaccine (96%; 95%CI:87-99). For those without 
      past infection, protection was lower with two doses of mRNA vaccine (67%; 
      95%CI:63-71). INTERPRETATION: In line with other observational studies, we find 
      reduced vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic Delta infections. The settings 
      and activities at increased risk of infection indicate where efforts to reinforce 
      individual and public health measures need to be concentrated.

TI  - Association Between Vaccination Status and Mortality Among Intubated Patients 
      With COVID-19-Related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.
PG  - e2235219
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.35219 [doi]
LID - e2235219
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Although vaccination substantially reduces the risk of severe 
      COVID-19, it is yet unknown whether vaccinated patients who develop COVID-19 and 
      require invasive mechanical ventilation have lower mortality than controls. 
      OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between COVID-19 vaccination status and 
      mortality among critically ill patients who require invasive mechanical 
      ventilation owing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to 
      COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cohort study was 
      performed between June 7, 2021, and February 1, 2022, among 265 consecutive adult 
      patients with COVID-19 in academic intensive care units who underwent invasive 
      mechanical ventilation owing to ARDS. EXPOSURES: Patients in the full vaccination 
      group had completed the primary COVID-19 vaccination series more than 14 days but 
      less than 5 months prior to intubation. This time threshold was chosen because 
      guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend a 
      booster dose beyond that time. The remaining patients (ie, those who were 
      unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, or fully vaccinated <14 days or >5 months 
      before intubation) comprised the control group. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The 
      primary outcome was time from intubation to all-cause intensive care unit 
      mortality. A Cox proportional hazards regression model including vaccination 
      status, age, comorbid conditions, and baseline Sequential Organ Failure 
      Assessment score on the day of intubation was used. RESULTS: A total of 265 
      intubated patients (170 men [64.2%]; median age, 66.0 years [IQR, 58.0-76.0 
      years]; 26 [9.8%] in the full vaccination group) were included in the study. A 
      total of 20 patients (76.9%) in the full vaccination group received the BNT162b2 
      vaccine, and the remaining 6 (23.1%) received the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. 
      Patients in the full vaccination group were older (median age, 72.5 years [IQR, 
      62.8-80.0 years] vs 66.0 years [IQR, 57.0-75.0 years]) and more likely to have 
      comorbid conditions (24 of 26 [92.3%] vs 160 of 239 [66.9%]), including malignant 
      neoplasm (6 of 26 [23.1%] vs 18 of 239 [7.5%]), than those in the control group. 
      Full vaccination status was significantly associated with lower mortality 
      compared with controls (16 of 26 patients [61.5%] died in the full vaccination 
      group vs 163 of 239 [68.2%] in the control group; hazard ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 
      0.32-0.94]; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, full 
      vaccination status was associated with lower mortality compared with controls, 
      which suggests that vaccination might be beneficial even among patients who were 
      intubated owing to COVID-19-related ARDS. These results may inform discussions 
      with families about prognosis.

TI  - [Effectiveness of the first dose of BNT162b2 vaccine to preventing covid-19 in 
      healthcare personnel.].
LID - e202104070 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A first protective dose of vaccine may allow delaying the second dose 
      in a context of low supply. The objective is to assess the effectiveness of a 
      single dose of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (BNT162b2) after twelve days of its 
      administration in healthcare personnel (HCP) of a Health Department. METHODS: A 
      case-control study was made. HCP with suspected COVID-19 and HCP close contacts 
      of COVID-19 cases were included between January 27 and February 7, 2021. They 
      were PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2; those with positive PCR were considered cases and 
      those with negative PCR were considered controls. The crude (VE) and adjusted 
      (VEa) vaccine effectiveness to prevent COVID-19 cases and their 95% confidence 
      interval were calculated using the formula VE = (1-Odds ratio) x 100. RESULTS: 
      268 HCP were included, of which 70 (26.1%) were considered cases and 198 (73.9%) 
      controls. The frequency of vaccine exposure in cases was 55.7% vs. 69.7% in 
      controls (p=0.035). The VEa of the first vaccine dose was 52.6% (95%CI: 
      1.1-77.3). The VEa in the subgroup of HCP studied for suspected disease was 74.6% 
      (CI95%: 38.4-89.5). CONCLUSIONS: One dose of BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 
      offers early protection after twelve days of administration. These data could be 
      considered to adapt strategies and consider postponing the second dose in 
      situations of limited vaccine supply in order to achieve the maximum number of 
      people covered with a first dose.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To inform public health policy, it is critical to monitor coronavirus 
      disease 2019 vaccine effectiveness (VE), including against acquiring infection. 
      METHODS: We estimated VE using self-reported vaccination in a retrospective 
      cohort of repeat blood donors who donated during the first half of 2021, and we 
      demonstrated a viable approach for monitoring VE via serological surveillance. 
      RESULTS: Using Poisson regression, we estimated an overall VE of 88.8% (95% 
      confidence interval, 86.2-91.1), adjusted for demographic covariates and variable 
      baseline risk. CONCLUSIONS: The time since first reporting vaccination, age, race 
      and/or ethnicity, region, and calendar time were statistically significant 
      predictors of incident infection.

TI  - Describing the population experiencing COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough following 
      second vaccination in England: a cohort study from OpenSAFELY.
PG  - 243
LID - 10.1186/s12916-022-02422-0 [doi]
LID - 243
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the vaccines against COVID-19 are highly effective, COVID-19 
      vaccine breakthrough is possible despite being fully vaccinated. With SARS-CoV-2 
      variants still circulating, describing the characteristics of individuals who 
      have experienced COVID-19 vaccine breakthroughs could be hugely important in 
      helping to determine who may be at greatest risk. METHODS: With the approval of 
      NHS England, we conducted a retrospective cohort study using routine clinical 
      data from the OpenSAFELY-TPP database of fully vaccinated individuals, linked to 
      secondary care and death registry data and described the characteristics of those 
      experiencing COVID-19 vaccine breakthroughs. RESULTS: As of 1st November 2021, a 
      total of 15,501,550 individuals were identified as being fully vaccinated against 
      COVID-19, with a median follow-up time of 149 days (IQR: ​107-179). From within 
      this population, a total of 579,780 (<4%) individuals reported a positive 
      SARS-CoV-2 test. For every 1000 years of patient follow-up time, the 
      corresponding incidence rate (IR) was 98.06 (95% CI 97.93-98.19). There were 
      28,580 COVID-19-related hospital admissions, 1980 COVID-19-related critical care 
      admissions and 6435 COVID-19-related deaths; corresponding IRs 4.77 (95% CI 
      4.74-4.80), 0.33 (95% CI 0.32-0.34) and 1.07 (95% CI 1.06-1.09), respectively. 
      The highest rates of breakthrough COVID-19 were seen in those in care homes and 
      in patients with chronic kidney disease, dialysis, transplant, haematological 
      malignancy or who were immunocompromised. CONCLUSIONS: While the majority of 
      COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough cases in England were mild, some differences in 
      rates of breakthrough cases have been identified in several clinical groups. 
      While it is important to note that these findings are simply descriptive and 
      cannot be used to answer why certain groups have higher rates of COVID-19 
      breakthrough than others, the emergence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 
      coupled with the number of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests still occurring is 
      concerning and as numbers of fully vaccinated (and boosted) individuals increases 
      and as follow-up time lengthens, so too will the number of COVID-19 breakthrough 
      cases. Additional analyses, to assess vaccine waning and rates of breakthrough 
      COVID-19 between different variants, aimed at identifying individuals at higher 
      risk, are needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the marginal effectiveness of a fourth versus third dose 
      and the vaccine effectiveness of mRNA covid-19 vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 
      against any infection, symptomatic infection, and severe outcomes (hospital 
      admission or death) related to the omicron variant. DESIGN: Test negative design. 
      SETTING: Long term care facilities in Ontario, Canada, 30 December 2021 to 27 
      April 2022. PARTICIPANTS: After exclusions, 61 344 residents aged 60 years or 
      older across 626 long term care facilities in Ontario, Canada who were tested for 
      SARS-CoV-2 were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Laboratory confirmed omicron 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection (any and symptomatic) by reverse transcription polymerase 
      chain reaction (RT-PCR), and hospital admission or death. Multivariable logistic 
      regression was used to estimate marginal effectiveness (four versus three doses) 
      and vaccine effectiveness (two, three, or four doses versus no doses) while 
      adjusting for personal characteristics, comorbidities, week of test, and previous 
      positive SARS-CoV-2 test result more than 90 days previously. RESULTS: 13 654 
      residents who tested positive for omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection and 205 862 test 
      negative controls were included. The marginal effectiveness of a fourth dose (95% 
      of vaccine recipients received mRNA-1273 as the fourth dose) seven days or more 
      after vaccination versus a third dose received 84 or more days previously was 19% 
      (95% confidence interval 12% to 26%) against infection, 31% (20% to 41%) against 
      symptomatic infection, and 40% (24% to 52%) against severe outcomes. Vaccine 
      effectiveness in vaccine recipients (compared with unvaccinated) increased with 
      each additional dose, and for a fourth dose was 49% (95% confidence interval 43% 
      to 54%) against infection, 69% (61% to 76%) against symptomatic infection, and 
      86% (81% to 90%) against severe outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that 
      compared with a third dose of mRNA covid-19 vaccine, a fourth dose improved 
      protection against infection, symptomatic infection, and severe outcomes among 
      long term care residents during an omicron dominant period. A fourth vaccine dose 
      was associated with strong protection against severe outcomes in vaccinated 
      residents compared with unvaccinated residents, although the duration of 
      protection remains unknown.

AB  - The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine 
      for pregnant women, although data regarding effectiveness during pregnancy are 
      lacking. This national, population-based, historical cohort study of pregnant 
      women in Israel, delivering between August 1, 2021 and March 22, 2022, aims to 
      analyze and compare the third and second doses' vaccine effectiveness in 
      preventing COVID-19-related hospitalizations during pregnancy during two COVID-19 
      waves (Delta variant in the summer of 2021 and Omicron, BA.1, variant in the 
      winter of 2022). Time-dependent Cox proportional-hazards regression models 
      estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for 
      COVID-related outcomes according to vaccine dose, and vaccine effectiveness as 
      1-HR. Study includes 82,659 and 33,303 pregnant women from the Delta and Omicron 
      waves, respectively. Compared with the second dose, the third dose effectively 
      prevents overall hospitalizations with SARS-CoV-2 infections, with estimated 
      effectiveness of 92% (95% CI 83-96%) during Delta, and enhances protection 
      against significant disease during Omicron, with effectiveness of 92% (95% CI 
      26-99%), and 48% (95% CI 37-57%) effectiveness against hospitalization overall. A 
      third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy, given at least 
      5 months after the second vaccine dose, enhances protection against adverse 
      COVID-19-related outcomes.

TI  - Effectiveness of Maternal Vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine During Pregnancy 
      Against COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization in Infants Aged <6 Months - 17 
      States, July 2021-January 2022.

AB  - COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for persons who are pregnant, breastfeeding, 
      trying to get pregnant now, or who might become pregnant in the future, to 
      protect them from COVID-19.(§) Infants are at risk for life-threatening 
      complications from COVID-19, including acute respiratory failure (1). Evidence 
      from other vaccine-preventable diseases suggests that maternal immunization can 
      provide protection to infants, especially during the high-risk first 6 months of 
      life, through passive transplacental antibody transfer (2). Recent studies of 
      COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy suggest the possibility of transplacental 
      transfer of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies that might provide protection to 
      infants (3-5); however, no epidemiologic evidence currently exists for the 
      protective benefits of maternal immunization during pregnancy against COVID-19 in 
      infants. The Overcoming COVID-19 network conducted a test-negative, case-control 
      study at 20 pediatric hospitals in 17 states during July 1, 2021-January 17, 
      2022, to assess effectiveness of maternal completion of a 2-dose primary mRNA 
      COVID-19 vaccination series during pregnancy against COVID-19 hospitalization in 
      infants. Among 379 hospitalized infants aged <6 months (176 with COVID-19 
      [case-infants] and 203 without COVID-19 [control-infants]), the median age was 2 
      months, 21% had at least one underlying medical condition, and 22% of case- and 
      control-infants were born premature (<37 weeks gestation). Effectiveness of 
      maternal vaccination during pregnancy against COVID-19 hospitalization in infants 
      aged <6 months was 61% (95% CI = 31%-78%). Completion of a 2-dose mRNA COVID-19 
      vaccination series during pregnancy might help prevent COVID-19 hospitalization 
      among infants aged <6 months.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infants younger than 6 months of age are at high risk for 
      complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and are not eligible for 
      vaccination. Transplacental transfer of antibodies against severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) after maternal Covid-19 
      vaccination may confer protection against Covid-19 in infants. METHODS: We used a 
      case-control test-negative design to assess the effectiveness of maternal 
      vaccination during pregnancy against hospitalization for Covid-19 among infants 
      younger than 6 months of age. Between July 1, 2021, and March 8, 2022, we 
      enrolled infants hospitalized for Covid-19 (case infants) and infants 
      hospitalized without Covid-19 (control infants) at 30 hospitals in 22 states. We 
      estimated vaccine effectiveness by comparing the odds of full maternal 
      vaccination (two doses of mRNA vaccine) among case infants and control infants 
      during circulation of the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant (July 1, 2021, to December 
      18, 2021) and the B.1.1.259 (omicron) variant (December 19, 2021, to March 8, 
      2022). RESULTS: A total of 537 case infants (181 of whom had been admitted to a 
      hospital during the delta period and 356 during the omicron period; median age, 2 
      months) and 512 control infants were enrolled and included in the analyses; 16% 
      of the case infants and 29% of the control infants had been born to mothers who 
      had been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 during pregnancy. Among the case 
      infants, 113 (21%) received intensive care (64 [12%] received mechanical 
      ventilation or vasoactive infusions). Two case infants died from Covid-19; 
      neither infant's mother had been vaccinated during pregnancy. The effectiveness 
      of maternal vaccination against hospitalization for Covid-19 among infants was 
      52% (95% confidence interval [CI], 33 to 65) overall, 80% (95% CI, 60 to 90) 
      during the delta period, and 38% (95% CI, 8 to 58) during the omicron period. 
      Effectiveness was 69% (95% CI, 50 to 80) when maternal vaccination occurred after 
      20 weeks of pregnancy and 38% (95% CI, 3 to 60) during the first 20 weeks of 
      pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal vaccination with two doses of mRNA vaccine was 
      associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization for Covid-19, including for 
      critical illness, among infants younger than 6 months of age. (Funded by the

TI  - COVID-19 vaccine coverage in health-care workers in England and effectiveness of 
      BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine against infection (SIREN): a prospective, multicentre, 
      cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: BNT162b2 mRNA and ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 adenoviral vector vaccines have 
      been rapidly rolled out in the UK from December, 2020. We aimed to determine the 
      factors associated with vaccine coverage for both vaccines and documented the 
      vaccine effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in a cohort of health-care 
      workers undergoing regular asymptomatic testing. METHODS: The SIREN study is a 
      prospective cohort study among staff (aged ≥18 years) working in publicly-funded 
      hospitals in the UK. Participants were assigned into either the positive cohort 
      (antibody positive or history of infection [indicated by previous positivity of 
      antibody or PCR tests]) or the negative cohort (antibody negative with no 
      previous positive test) at the beginning of the follow-up period. Baseline risk 
      factors were collected at enrolment, symptom status was collected every 2 weeks, 
      and vaccination status was collected through linkage to the National 
      Immunisations Management System and questionnaires. Participants had fortnightly 
      asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and monthly antibody testing, and all tests 
      (including symptomatic testing) outside SIREN were captured. Data cutoff for this 
      analysis was Feb 5, 2021. The follow-up period was Dec 7, 2020, to Feb 5, 2021. 
      The primary outcomes were vaccinated participants (binary ever vacinated 
      variable; indicated by at least one vaccine dose recorded by at least one of the 
      two vaccination data sources) for the vaccine coverage analysis and SARS-CoV-2 
      infection confirmed by a PCR test for the vaccine effectiveness analysis. We did 
      a mixed-effect logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with 
      vaccine coverage. We used a piecewise exponential hazard mixed-effects model 
      (shared frailty-type model) using a Poisson distribution to calculate hazard 
      ratios to compare time-to-infection in unvaccinated and vaccinated participants 
      and estimate the impact of the BNT162b2 vaccine on all PCR-positive infections 
      (asymptomatic and symptomatic). This study is registered with ISRCTN, number 
      ISRCTN11041050, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: 23 324 participants from 104 sites (all 
      in England) met the inclusion criteria for this analysis and were enrolled. 
      Included participants had a median age of 46·1 years (IQR 36·0-54·1) and 19 692 
      (84%) were female; 8203 (35%) were assigned to the positive cohort at the start 
      of the analysis period, and 15 121 (65%) assigned to the negative cohort. Total 
      follow-up time was 2 calendar months and 1 106 905 person-days (396 318 
      vaccinated and 710 587 unvaccinated). Vaccine coverage was 89% on Feb 5, 2021, 
      94% of whom had BNT162b2 vaccine. Significantly lower coverage was associated 
      with previous infection, gender, age, ethnicity, job role, and Index of Multiple 
      Deprivation score. During follow-up, there were 977 new infections in the 
      unvaccinated cohort, an incidence density of 14 infections per 10 000 
      person-days; the vaccinated cohort had 71 new infections 21 days or more after 
      their first dose (incidence density of eight infections per 10 000 person-days) 
      and nine infections 7 days after the second dose (incidence density four 
      infections per 10 000 person-days). In the unvaccinated cohort, 543 (56%) 
      participants had typical COVID-19 symptoms and 140 (14%) were asymptomatic on or 
      14 days before their PCR positive test date, compared with 29 (36%) with typical 
      COVID-19 symptoms and 15 (19%) asymptomatic in the vaccinated cohort. A single 
      dose of BNT162b2 vaccine showed vaccine effectiveness of 70% (95% CI 55-85) 21 
      days after first dose and 85% (74-96) 7 days after two doses in the study 
      population. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that the BNT162b2 vaccine can 
      prevent both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection in working-age adults. This 
      cohort was vaccinated when the dominant variant in circulation was B1.1.7 and 
      shows effectiveness against this variant. FUNDING: Public Health England, UK

AB  - BACKGROUND: The duration and effectiveness of immunity from infection with and 
      vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      are relevant to pandemic policy interventions, including the timing of vaccine 
      boosters. METHODS: We investigated the duration and effectiveness of immunity in 
      a prospective cohort of asymptomatic health care workers in the United Kingdom 
      who underwent routine polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing. Vaccine 
      effectiveness (≤10 months after the first dose of vaccine) and infection-acquired 
      immunity were assessed by comparing the time to PCR-confirmed infection in 
      vaccinated persons with that in unvaccinated persons, stratified according to 
      previous infection status. We used a Cox regression model with adjustment for 
      previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status, vaccine type and dosing interval, 
      demographic characteristics, and workplace exposure to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Of 
      35,768 participants, 27% (9488) had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccine 
      coverage was high: 95% of the participants had received two doses (78% had 
      received BNT162b2 vaccine [Pfizer-BioNTech] with a long interval between doses, 
      9% BNT162b2 vaccine with a short interval between doses, and 8% ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 
      vaccine [AstraZeneca]). Between December 7, 2020, and September 21, 2021, a total 
      of 2747 primary infections and 210 reinfections were observed. Among previously 
      uninfected participants who received long-interval BNT162b2 vaccine, adjusted 
      vaccine effectiveness decreased from 85% (95% confidence interval [CI], 72 to 92) 
      14 to 73 days after the second dose to 51% (95% CI, 22 to 69) at a median of 201 
      days (interquartile range, 197 to 205) after the second dose; this effectiveness 
      did not differ significantly between the long-interval and short-interval 
      BNT162b2 vaccine recipients. At 14 to 73 days after the second dose, adjusted 
      vaccine effectiveness among ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine recipients was 58% (95% CI, 
      23 to 77) - considerably lower than that among BNT162b2 vaccine recipients. 
      Infection-acquired immunity waned after 1 year in unvaccinated participants but 
      remained consistently higher than 90% in those who were subsequently vaccinated, 
      even in persons infected more than 18 months previously. CONCLUSIONS: Two doses 
      of BNT162b2 vaccine were associated with high short-term protection against 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection; this protection waned considerably after 6 months. 
      Infection-acquired immunity boosted with vaccination remained high more than 1 
      year after infection. (Funded by the U.K. Health Security Agency and others;

AB  - BACKGROUND: The risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) decreases substantially among patients who have 
      recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). However, it is unknown how 
      long protective immunity lasts. Current guidelines recommend vaccination of 
      recovered patients even though data regarding vaccine effectiveness in such cases 
      are still limited. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed 
      electronic medical records from a large health care organization in Israel to 
      assess reinfection rates in patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      before any vaccination against Covid-19. We compared reinfection rates among 
      patients who had subsequently received the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) and 
      those who had not been vaccinated between March 1 and November 26, 2021. We used 
      a Cox proportional-hazards regression model with time-dependent covariates to 
      estimate the association between vaccination and reinfection after adjustment for 
      demographic factors and coexisting illnesses. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated 
      as 1 minus the hazard ratio. In a secondary analysis, we evaluated the vaccine 
      effectiveness of one dose as compared with two doses. RESULTS: A total of 149,032 
      patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection met the eligibility 
      criteria. Of these patients, 83,356 (56%) received subsequent vaccination during 
      the 270-day study period. Reinfection occurred in 354 of the vaccinated patients 
      (2.46 cases per 100,000 persons per day) and in 2168 of 65,676 unvaccinated 
      patients (10.21 cases per 100,000 persons per day). Vaccine effectiveness was 
      estimated at 82% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80 to 84) among patients who were 
      16 to 64 years of age and 60% (95% CI, 36 to 76) among those 65 years of age or 
      older. No significant difference in vaccine effectiveness was found for one dose 
      as compared with two doses. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who had recovered from 
      Covid-19, the receipt of at least one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine was associated 
      with a significantly lower risk of recurrent infection.

TI  - Risk of reinfection, vaccine protection, and severity of infection with the BA.5 
      omicron subvariant: a nation-wide population-based study in Denmark.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Estimates of immunity and severity for the SARS-CoV-2 omicron 
      subvariant BA.5 are important to assess the public health impact associated with 
      its rapid global spread despite vaccination. We estimated natural and vaccine 
      immunity and severity of BA.5 relative to BA.2 in Denmark, a country with high 
      mRNA-vaccination coverage and free-of-charge RT-PCR testing. METHODS: This 
      nation-wide population-based study in Denmark included residents aged 18 years or 
      older who had taken an RT-PCR test between 10 April and 30 June, 2022 (ie, the 
      outcome period), and who the national COVID-19 surveillance system identified as 
      having information since February 2020 on RT-PCR tests, whole-genome sequencing, 
      vaccinations, and hospitalisation with a positive RT-PCR test and COVID-19 as the 
      main diagnosis. First, we used a case-control design, in which cases were people 
      infected with BA.5 or BA.2 during the outcome period and controls were people who 
      tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection during the outcome period. We calculated 
      the protection provided by a previous PCR-confirmed omicron infection against 
      BA.5 and BA.2 infection and hospitalisation among triple-vaccinated individuals. 
      Second, we compared vaccination status in people infected with BA.5 versus BA.2 
      and estimated relative vaccine protection against each subvariant. Third, we 
      compared rates of hospitalisation for COVID-19 among people infected with BA.5 
      versus BA.2. We estimated effects using logistic regression with adjustment for 
      sex, age, region, PCR-test date, comorbidity and, as appropriate, vaccination and 
      previous infection status. FINDINGS: A total of 210 (2·4%) of 8678 of BA.5 cases, 
      192 (0·7%) of 29 292 of BA.2 cases, and 33 972 (19·0%) of 178 669 PCR-negative 
      controls previously had an omicron infection, which was estimated in the adjusted 
      analyses to offer 92·7% (95% CI 91·6-93·7) protection against BA.5 infection and 
      97·1% (96·6-97·5) protection against BA.2 infection. We found similarly high 
      amounts of protection against hospitalisation owing to infection with BA.5 (96·4% 
      [95% CI 74·2-99·5]) and BA.2 (91·2% [76·3-96·7]). Vaccine coverage (three mRNA 
      doses vs none) was 9307 (94·2%) of 9878 among BA.5 cases and 30 581 (94·8%) of 
      32 272 among BA.2 cases, although in the adjusted analysis, there was a trend 
      towards slightly higher vaccination coverage among BA.5 cases than BA.2 cases (OR 
      1·18 [95% CI 0·99-1·42]; p=0·064), possibly suggesting marginally poorer vaccine 
      protection against BA.5. The rate of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 was higher 
      among the BA.5 cases (210 [1·9%] of 11 314) than among the BA.2 cases (514 [1·4%] 
      of 36 805), with an OR of 1·34 (95% CI 1·14-1·57) and an adjusted OR of 1·69 (95% 
      CI 1·22-2·33), despite low and stable COVID-19 hospitalisation numbers during the 
      study period. INTERPRETATION: The study provides evidence that a previous omicron 
      infection in triple-vaccinated individuals provides high amounts of protection 
      against BA.5 and BA.2 infections. However, protection estimates greater than 90% 
      might be too high if individuals with a previous infection were more likely than 
      those without one to come forward for a test for reasons other than suspicion of 
      COVID-19. Our analysis also showed that vaccine protection against BA.5 infection 
      was similar to, or slightly weaker than, protection against BA.2 infection. 
      Finally, there was evidence that BA.5 infections were associated with an 
      increased risk of hospitalisation compared with BA.2 infections. FUNDING: There 
      was no funding source for this study.

TI  - Effectiveness of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Vaccination Against Severe 
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection Among Residents 
      of US Nursing Homes Before and During the Delta Variant Predominance, December 
      2020-November 2021.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Residents of nursing homes experience disproportionate morbidity and 
      mortality related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and were prioritized for 
      vaccine introduction. We evaluated COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) in 
      preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      infections among nursing home residents. METHODS: We used a retrospective cohort 
      of 4315 nursing home residents during 14 December 2020-9 November 2021. A Cox 
      proportional hazards model was used to estimate hazard ratios comparing residents 
      with a completed vaccination series with unvaccinated among those with and 
      without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, by vaccine product, and by time period. 
      RESULTS: Overall adjusted VE was 58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44% to 69%) 
      among residents without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the pre-Delta 
      period, the VE within 150 days of receipt of the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech 
      (67%; 95% CI, 40% to 82%) and Moderna (75%; 95% CI, 32% to 91%) was similar. 
      During the Delta period, VE measured >150 days after the second dose was 33% (95% 
      CI, -2% to 56%) for Pfizer-BioNTech and 77% (95% CI, 48% to 91%) for Moderna. 
      Rates of infection were 78% lower (95% CI, 67% to 85%) among residents with prior 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and completed vaccination series compared with unvaccinated 
      residents without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 
      vaccines were effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections among nursing home 
      residents, and history of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection provided additional 
      protection. Maintaining high coverage of recommended doses of COVID-19 vaccines 
      remains a critical tool for preventing infections in nursing homes.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination elicits broad and potent Fc effector functions to 
      VOCs in vulnerable populations.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 variants have continuously emerged even as highly effective vaccines 
      have been widely deployed. Reduced neutralization observed against variants of 
      concern (VOC) raises the question as to whether other antiviral antibody 
      activities are similarly compromised, or if they might compensate for lost 
      neutralization activity. In this study, the breadth and potency of antibody 
      recognition and effector function was surveyed in both healthy individuals as 
      well as immunologically vulnerable subjects following either natural infection or 
      receipt of an mRNA vaccine. Considering pregnant women as a model cohort with 
      higher risk of severe illness and death, we observed similar binding and 
      functional breadth for healthy and immunologically vulnerable populations. In 
      contrast, considerably greater functional antibody breadth and potency across VOC 
      was associated with vaccination than prior infection. However, greater antibody 
      functional activity targeting the endemic coronavirus OC43 was noted among 
      convalescent individuals, illustrating a dichotomy in recognition between close 
      and distant human coronavirus strains that was associated with exposure history. 
      Probing the full-length spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) revealed that 
      antibody-mediated Fc effector functions were better maintained against 
      full-length spike as compared to RBD. This analysis of antibody functions in 
      healthy and vulnerable populations across a panel of SARS-CoV-2 VOC and extending 
      through endemic alphacoronavirus strains suggests the differential potential for 
      antibody effector functions to contribute to protecting vaccinated and 
      convalescent subjects as the pandemic progresses and novel variants continue to 
      evolve. ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY: As compared to natural infection with SARS-CoV-2, 
      vaccination drives superior functional antibody breadth raising hopes for 
      candidate universal CoV vaccines.

TI  - Differences in COVID-19 vaccination uptake in the first 12 months of vaccine 
      availability in Switzerland - a prospective cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Widespread vaccination uptake has been shown to be crucial in 
      controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences on healthcare 
      infrastructures. Infection numbers, hospitalisation rates and mortality can be 
      mitigated if large parts of the population are being vaccinated. However, one 
      year after the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, a substantial share of the 
      Swiss population still refrains from being vaccinated. OBJECTIVES: We analysed 
      COVID-19 vaccination uptake during the first 12 months of vaccine availability. 
      We compared vaccination rates of different socioeconomic subgroups (e.g., 
      education, income, migration background) and regions (urban vs rural, language 
      region) and investigated associations between uptake and individual traits such 
      as health literacy, adherence to COVID-19 prevention measures and trust in 
      government or science. METHODS: Our analysis was based on self-reported 
      vaccination uptake of a longitudinal online panel of Swiss adults aged 18 to 79 
      (the "COVID-19 Social Monitor", analysis sample n = 2448). The panel is 
      representative for Switzerland with regard to age, gender, and language regions. 
      Participants have been periodically surveyed about various public health issues 
      from 30 March 2020, to 16 December 2021. We report uptake rates and 
      age-stratified hazard ratios (HRs) by population subgroups without and with 
      additional covariate adjustment using Cox regression survival analysis. RESULTS: 
      Higher uptake rates were found for individuals with more than just compulsory 
      schooling (secondary: unadjusted HR 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.76; 
      tertiary: HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.52-2.47), household income above CHF 4999 (5000-9999: 
      unadj. HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.25-1.61; ≥10,000 HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.72-2.30), those 
      suffering from a chronic condition (unadj. HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.25-1.53), and for 
      individuals with a sufficient or excellent level of health literacy (sufficient: 
      unadj. HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.98-1.29; excellent: HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10-1.34). We found 
      lower rates for residents of rural regions (unadj. HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70-0.88), 
      those showing less adherence to COVID-19 prevention measures, and those with less 
      trust in government or science. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination uptake is multifactorial 
      and influenced by sociodemographic status, health literacy, trust in institutions 
      and expected risk of severe COVID-19 illness. Fears of unwanted vaccine effects 
      and doubts regarding vaccine effectiveness appear to drive uptake hesitancy and 
      demand special attention in future vaccination campaigns.

AB  - A two-dose regimen of the Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1) Covid-19 vaccine with an 
      inter-dose interval of three months has been implemented in many countries with 
      restricted vaccine supply. However, there is limited evidence for the 
      effectiveness of ChAdOx1 by dose in elderly populations in countries with high 
      prevalence of the Gamma variant of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we estimate ChAdOx1 
      effectiveness by dose against the primary endpoint of RT-PCR-confirmed Covid-19, 
      and secondary endpoints of Covid-19 hospitalization and Covid-19-related death, 
      in adults aged ≥60 years during an epidemic with high Gamma variant prevalence in 
      São Paulo state, Brazil using a matched, test-negative case-control study. 
      Starting 28 days after the first dose, effectiveness of a single dose of ChAdOx1 
      is 33.4% (95% CI, 26.4-39.7) against Covid-19, 55.1% (95% CI, 46.6-62.2) against 
      hospitalization, and 61.8% (95% CI, 48.9-71.4) against death. Starting 14 days 
      after the second dose, effectiveness of the two-dose schedule is 77.9% (95% CI, 
      69.2-84.2) against Covid-19, 87.6% (95% CI, 78.2-92.9) against hospitalization, 
      and 93.6% (95% CI, 81.9-97.7) against death. Completion of the ChAdOx1 vaccine 
      schedule affords significantly increased protection over a single dose against 
      mild and severe Covid-19 outcomes in elderly individuals during widespread Gamma 
      variant circulation.

AB  - Studies reporting vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 outcomes concentrate 
      mainly on estimates of one single type of vaccine and variant, seldom considering 
      waning effects. We aimed to estimate the effectiveness of the overall COVID-19 
      vaccination programme implemented in the Apulia region of Italy at preventing 
      SARS-CoV-2 infections, COVID-19-related hospital admissions and deaths during 
      alpha and delta variant dominant periods. We conducted a retrospective cohort 
      study using electronic health records of persons 16 years and older resident in 
      the Apulia region, assessing the effectiveness of the combined use of BNT162b2, 
      mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1-S and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines against confirmed COVID-19 
      infections, hospitalisations and deaths, for fully and partially vaccinated 
      persons as well as by time since vaccination and variants. Cox regression models 
      yielding hazard ratios were used to calculate the overall vaccination programme 
      effectiveness. From 1 January to 1 December 2021, we included 3,530,967 eligible 
      persons in the cohort, of whom 2,770,299 were fully vaccinated and 158,313 were 
      COVID-19 positive at the end of the study period. The effectiveness of the 
      programme over the entire study period for fully vaccinated persons against 
      COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation and death were 87.69% (CI95% 87.73-88.18), 
      94.08% (93.58-94.54) and 95.95% (CI95% 95.26-96.54), respectively. The 
      effectiveness against COVID-19 infection of fully vaccinated subjects during the 
      alpha and delta period was respectively 88.20% (CI95% 87.60-99.78) and 59.31% 
      (CI95% 57.91-60.67), against hospitalisation 93.89% (CI95% 92.67-94.90) and 
      88.32% (CI95% 86.50-89.90) and against death 93.83% (CI95% 91.65-95.45) and 85.91 
      (CI95% 79.98-90.09). The waning effects of the programme regarding COVID-19 
      infection during the delta period were stronger than for alpha, with 75.85% 
      (CI95% 74.38-77.24) effectiveness after 1-2 months and 8.35% (CI95% 3.45-13.01) 
      after 5-6 months after full vaccination. The effectiveness against 
      hospitalisation and death during the delta period waned rapidly and at 7-8-months 
      after the full vaccination respectively decreased to 27.67% (CI95% 7.48-43.45) 
      and 48.47 (CI95% 53.97-34.82). Our study suggests that the COVID-19 vaccination 
      program in Apulia was strongly protective against COVID-19 infection, 
      hospitalisation, and death due to alpha as well as delta variants, although its 
      effectiveness is reduced over time.

TI  - Comparison of Homologous and Heterologous Booster SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in 
      Autoimmune Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Patients.
LID - 10.3390/ijms231911411 [doi]
LID - 11411
AB  - Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 to prevent COVID-19 is highly recommended for 
      immunocompromised patients with autoimmune rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases 
      (aiRMDs). Little is known about the effect of booster vaccination or infection 
      followed by previously completed two-dose vaccination in aiRMDs. We determined 
      neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and applied flow cytometric 
      immunophenotyping to quantify the SARS-CoV-2 reactive B- and T-cell mediated 
      immunity in aiRMDs receiving homologous or heterologous boosters or acquired 
      infection following vaccination. Patients receiving a heterologous booster had a 
      higher proportion of IgM+ SARS-CoV-2 S+ CD19+CD27+ peripheral memory B-cells in 
      comparison to those who acquired infection. Biologic therapy decreased the number 
      of S+CD19+; S+CD19+CD27+IgG+; and S+CD19+CD27+IgM+ B-cells. The response rate to 
      a booster event in cellular immunity was the highest in the S-, M-, and 
      N-reactive CD4+CD40L+ T-cell subset. Patients with a disease duration of more 
      than 10 years had higher proportions of CD8+TNF-α+ and CD8+IFN-γ+ T-cells in 
      comparison to patients who were diagnosed less than 10 years ago. We detected 
      neutralizing antibodies, S+ reactive peripheral memory B-cells, and five S-, M-, 
      and N-reactive T-cells subsets in our patient cohort showing the importance of 
      booster events. Biologic therapy and &lt;10 years disease duration may confound 
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific immunity in aiRMDs.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Vaccine effectiveness studies have rarely implemented strategies to 
      reduce the healthy vaccinee bias arising from differences in health care-seeking 
      behavior between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Although previous 
      observational studies suggest that influenza vaccination is associated with a 
      reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2-associated outcomes, the healthy vaccinee bias may 
      have led to overestimating the vaccination effect. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the 
      association between influenza vaccination and SARS-CoV-2-associated outcomes. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted over 2 
      consecutive influenza vaccination campaigns (2019-2020 and 2020-2021), owing to 
      the substantial COVID-19 burden and the greater validity of influenza vaccination 
      data in the studied age group. The study population included community-dwelling 
      adults aged 66 years or older in Ontario, Canada. EXPOSURE: Influenza vaccination 
      for a given season. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The outcomes of interest included 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2-associated hospitalization, 
      SARS-CoV-2-associated death, and a composite of SARS-CoV-2-associated 
      hospitalization or death. Cox proportional hazards models were used to measure 
      the association between influenza vaccination and SARS-CoV-2-associated outcomes, 
      censoring individuals who moved into long-term care, received COVID-19 vaccines, 
      or died before the observation period end date. Primary care periodic health 
      examinations (PHEs) were explored as a negative tracer exposure (ie, no 
      association expected with SARS-CoV-2 outcomes) and as an effect modifier of the 
      association between influenza vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 outcomes. RESULTS: Of 
      2 922 449 individuals aged 66 years or older (54.2% female) living in Ontario, 2 
      279 805 were included in the study. Among these, 1 234 647 (54.2%) were female 
      and 1 045 158 (45.8%) were male; their mean (SD) age was 75.08 (7.21) years. 
      Those who had received influenza vaccination exhibited a lower incidence of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection than unvaccinated individuals for the 2019-2020 cohort 
      (adjusted hazards ratio [aHR], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.73-0.84) and the 2020-2021 cohort 
      (aHR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.74-0.78). This association was also observed for 
      SARS-CoV-2-associated hospitalization or death (2019-2020: aHR, 0.83; 95% CI, 
      0.74-0.92; 2020-2021: aHR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.63-0.70). Similarly, undergoing a PHE 
      was also associated with a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (aHR, 0.85; 
      95% CI, 0.78-0.91) and SARS-CoV-2-associated hospitalization or death (aHR, 0.80; 
      95% CI, 0.70-0.90), and modified the association between influenza vaccination 
      and SARS-CoV-2 infection for vaccinated individuals who underwent PHE (aHR, 0.62; 
      95% CI, 0.52-0.74) and for vaccinated individuals who did not undergo PHE 
      (aHR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.76-0.87), and also SARS-CoV-2-associated hospitalization or 
      death in vaccinated individuals who underwent PHE (aHR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49-0.88) 
      and vaccinated individuals who did not undergo PHE (aHR, 0.85, 95% CI, 
      0.76-0.95). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this cohort study suggest 
      that undergoing a PHE may at least partially modify the association between 
      influenza vaccination and SARS-CoV-2-associated outcomes in individuals aged 66 
      years or older, providing evidence of the healthy vaccinee bias that may affect 
      vaccine effectiveness studies.

TI  - Risk of venous thromboembolism after COVID-19 vaccination.
PG  - 1638-1644
LID - 10.1111/jth.15725 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States are effective in 
      preventing illness and hospitalization yet concern over post-vaccination venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE) risk has led to vaccine hesitancy. METHODS: The aim of this 
      study was to compare VTE rates before and after COVID-19 vaccination. COVID-19 
      vaccinated patients ≥18 years between November 1, 2020 through November 1, 2021 
      were analyzed using electronic medical records across the Mayo Clinic enterprise. 
      The primary outcome was imaging confirmed acute VTE (upper or lower deep vein 
      thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) occurring 90 days before and after the date of 
      first vaccine dose. RESULTS: A total of 792 010 patients with at least one 
      COVID-19 vaccination were identified (Pfizer, n = 452 950, Moderna, n = 290 607, 
      and Janssen [Johnson & Johnson], n = 48 453). A total of 1565 VTE events occurred 
      in the 90 days before (n = 772) and after (n = 793) COVID-19 vaccination. VTE 
      post-vaccination occurred in 326 patients receiving Moderna (0.11%, incidence 
      rate [IR] 4.58 per 1000p-years), 425 patients receiving Pfizer (0.09%, IR 3.84 
      per 1000p-years), and 42 receiving Janssen (0.09%, IR 3.56 per 1000p-years). 
      Compared to the pre-vaccination timeframe, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for 
      VTE after the Janssen vaccination was 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
      0.63-1.50), aHR 1.02 (95% CI 0.87-1.19) for Moderna, and aHR 1.00 (95% CI 
      0.87-1.15) for Pfizer. CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of COVID-19 vaccinated 
      patients, no increased risk for acute VTE post-vaccination was identified for the 
      authorized vaccines in the United States.

TI  - Predictive capacity of COVID-19-related risk beliefs on weight management 
      behaviors on a commercial weight loss program and speed of COVID-19 vaccination 
      uptake: prospective cohort study.
PG  - 2334

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent work has shown that obesity may be a risk factor for severe 
      COVID-19. However, it is unclear to what extent individuals have heard or believe 
      this risk factor information, and how these beliefs may predict their preventive 
      behaviors (e.g., weight management behaviors or COVID-19 preventive behaviors). 
      Previous work has primarily looked at overall risk likelihood perceptions (i.e., 
      not about obesity as a risk factor) within general populations of varying weight 
      and concentrated on COVID-19-related preventive behaviors. Therefore, this 
      prospective cohort study explored whether beliefs about obesity as a risk factor 
      and overall risk likelihood perceptions predicted weight management and COVID-19 
      preventive behaviors over the next 16 weeks in individuals with obesity or 
      overweight. METHODS: Participants were 393 individuals in the US who joined a 
      commercial weight management program in January, 2021. We leveraged the mobile 
      program's automatic measurement of real-time engagement in weight management 
      behaviors (e.g., steps taken), while surveys measured risk beliefs at baseline as 
      well as when individuals received COVID-19 vaccination doses (asked monthly) over 
      the next 16 weeks. Mixed effects models predicted engagement and weight loss each 
      week for 16 weeks, while ordinal logistic regression models predicted the month 
      that individuals got vaccinated against COVID-19. RESULTS: We found that belief 
      in obesity as a risk factor at baseline significantly predicted greater 
      engagement (e.g., steps taken, foods logged) in program-measured weight 
      management behaviors over the next 16 weeks in models adjusted for baseline BMI, 
      age, gender, and local vaccination rates (minimally adjusted) and in models 
      additionally adjusted for demographic factors. Belief in obesity as a risk factor 
      at baseline also significantly predicted speed of COVID-19 vaccination uptake in 
      minimally adjusted models but not when demographic factors were taken into 
      account. Exposure to obesity risk factor information at baseline predicted 
      greater engagement over 16 weeks in minimally adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      results highlight the potential utility of effective education to increase 
      individuals' belief in obesity risk factor information and ultimately promote 
      engagement or faster vaccination. Future research should investigate to what 
      extent the results generalize to other populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about long-term effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine in 
      reducing severity and deaths associated with Omicron VOC not perturbed by prior 
      infection and independent of oral anti-viral therapy and non-pharmaceutical 
      (NPI). METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was applied to Taiwan 
      community during the unprecedent large-scale outbreaks of Omicron BA.2 between 
      April and August, 2022. Primary vaccination since March, 2021 and booster 
      vaccination since January, 2022 were offered on population level. Oral Anti-viral 
      therapy was also offered as of mid-May 2022. The population-based effectiveness 
      of vaccination in reducing the risk of moderate and severe cases of and death 
      from Omicron BA.2 with the consideration of NPI and oral anti-viral therapy were 
      assessed by using Bayesian hierarchical models. RESULTS: The risks of three 
      clinical outcomes associated with Omicron VOC infection were lowest for booster 
      vaccination, followed by primary vaccination, and highest for incomplete 
      vaccination with the consistent trends of being at increased risk for three 
      outcomes from the young people aged 12 years or below until the elderly people 
      aged 75 years or older with 7 age groups. Before the period using oral anti-viral 
      therapy, complete primary vaccination with the duration more than 9 months before 
      outbreaks conferred the statistically significant 47 % (23-64 %) reduction of 
      death, 48 % (30-61 %) of severe disease, and 46 % (95 % CI: 37-54 %) of moderate 
      disease after adjusting for 10-20 % independent effect of NPI. The benefits of 
      booster vaccination within three months were further enhanced to 76 % (95 % CI: 
      67-86 %), 74 % (95 % CI: 67-80 %), and 61 % (95 % CI: 56-65 %) for three 
      corresponding outcomes. The additional effectiveness of oral anti-viral therapy 
      in reducing moderate disease was 13 % for the booster group and 5.8 % for primary 
      vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: We corroborated population effectiveness of primary 
      vaccination and its booster vaccination, independent of oral anti-viral therapy 
      and NPI, in reducing severe clinical outcomes associated with Omicron BA.2 naïve 
      infection population.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that has created a global 
      health crisis and upended conventional methodologies, both in the governance and 
      clinical structures of Health Care Systems. The spread of COVID-19 has 
      necessitated a coordinated public health response in an effective, extensive and 
      expedited vaccination rollout strategy with the ultimate aim of limiting all nidi 
      of infection for the pathogen. For this goal to be realised, pregnant women, as a 
      cohort, cannot reasonably be excluded from this initiative, despite the initial 
      reluctance to include them in clinical trials for various ethical and legal 
      reasons. Weighing the detrimental complications of COVID-19 on maternal and 
      perinatal outcomes against the hypothetical risk of vaccination in the context of 
      promising, albeit indirect, safety and efficacy data, this report argues that all 
      pregnant women should be offered the choice of whether or not to receive the 
      COVID-19 vaccine based on the available evidence and their individualised 
      risk-benefit ratio.

TI  - Heterologous vaccination interventions to reduce pandemic morbidity and 
      mortality: Modeling the US winter 2020 COVID-19 wave.
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2025448119 [doi]
LID - e2025448119
AB  - COVID-19 remains a stark health threat worldwide, in part because of minimal 
      levels of targeted vaccination outside high-income countries and highly 
      transmissible variants causing infection in vaccinated individuals. Decades of 
      theoretical and experimental data suggest that nonspecific effects of 
      non-COVID-19 vaccines may help bolster population immunological resilience to new 
      pathogens. These routine vaccinations can stimulate heterologous cross-protective 
      effects, which modulate nontargeted infections. For example, immunization with 
      Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, inactivated influenza vaccine, oral polio vaccine, and 
      other vaccines have been associated with some protection from SARS-CoV-2 
      infection and amelioration of COVID-19 disease. If heterologous vaccine 
      interventions (HVIs) are to be seriously considered by policy makers as bridging 
      or boosting interventions in pandemic settings to augment nonpharmaceutical 
      interventions and specific vaccination efforts, evidence is needed to determine 
      their optimal implementation. Using the COVID-19 International Modeling 
      Consortium mathematical model, we show that logistically realistic HVIs with low 
      (5 to 15%) effectiveness could have reduced COVID-19 cases, hospitalization, and 
      mortality in the United States fall/winter 2020 wave. Similar to other mass drug 
      administration campaigns (e.g., for malaria), HVI impact is highly dependent on 
      both age targeting and intervention timing in relation to incidence, with maximal 
      benefit accruing from implementation across the widest age cohort when the 
      pandemic reproduction number is >1.0. Optimal HVI logistics therefore differ from 
      optimal rollout parameters for specific COVID-19 immunizations. These results may 
      be generalizable beyond COVID-19 and the US to indicate how even minimally 
      effective heterologous immunization campaigns could reduce the burden of future 
      viral pandemics.

TI  - Association of AZD1222 and BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccination With Thromboembolic and 
      Thrombocytopenic Events in Frontline Personnel : A Retrospective Cohort Study.
PG  - 541-546
LID - 10.7326/M21-2452 [doi]
LID - M21-2452
AB  - BACKGROUND: In March 2021, several European countries suspended the use of the 
      AZD1222 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) COVID-19 vaccine because of thromboembolic safety 
      concerns. Reports from Norway and Germany subsequently described patients with 
      venous thrombosis and thrombocytopenia within 5 to 16 days of vaccination. 
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk for outcomes related to thrombosis and 
      thrombocytopenia after AZD1222 or BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 
      vaccination. DESIGN: Nationwide exploratory retrospective cohort study. SETTING: 
      Danish linkable registers on vaccinations, hospitalizations, occupation, and 
      other covariates. PARTICIPANTS: 355 209 Danish frontline personnel designated for 
      priority COVID-19 vaccination followed from 27 December 2020 (the day of the 
      first COVID-19 vaccination in Denmark) to 13 April 2021. MEASUREMENTS: Study 
      outcomes were cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, splanchnic vein thrombosis, 
      pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, 
      thrombocytopenia, and death. Cumulative incidences of study outcomes within 28 
      days of vaccination and unvaccinated risk time were compared using adjusted 
      survival curves resulting in risk differences (RDs) at day 28 after vaccination. 
      Adjustment for birth cohort, sex, calendar period, occupation, comorbid 
      conditions, and prescription drug use was included. RESULTS: Vaccination with 
      AZD1222 versus no vaccination was associated with a significant RD at day 28 for 
      deep venous thrombosis (RD, 8.35 [95% CI, 0.21 to 16.49] per 100 000 
      vaccinations). The RDs for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (RD, 1.68 [CI, -0.64 
      to 4.00] per 100 000 vaccinations) and thrombocytopenia (RD, 2.39 [CI, -1.09 to 
      5.87] per 100 000 vaccinations) were not significant. No adverse associations 
      were seen for BNT162b2 vaccination. LIMITATION: No medical record review; 
      surveillance bias. CONCLUSION: In this exploratory retrospective cohort study 
      among frontline personnel in Denmark, receipt of the AZD1222 vaccine was 
      associated with a small excess risk for deep venous thrombosis. Although the 
      corresponding risks for the more rare and severe thrombotic outcomes (such as 
      cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) were not statistically significantly increased, 
      statistical precision was low, and clinically relevant risks could not be 
      excluded with certainty. There was no statistically significant association of 
      BNT162b2 vaccination with thrombotic or thrombocytopenic events. PRIMARY FUNDING

      hospitalisations in people aged at least 80 years: a test-negative, case-control 
      study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: On Dec 8, 2020, deployment of the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination 
      authorised for UK use (BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine) began, followed by an adenoviral 
      vector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 on Jan 4, 2021. Care home residents and staff, 
      frontline health-care workers, and adults aged 80 years and older were vaccinated 
      first. However, few data exist regarding the effectiveness of these vaccines in 
      older people with many comorbidities. In this post-implementation evaluation of 
      two COVID-19 vaccines, we aimed to determine the effectiveness of one dose in 
      reducing COVID-19-related admissions to hospital in people of advanced age. 
      METHODS: This prospective test-negative case-control study included adults aged 
      at least 80 years who were admitted to hospital in two NHS trusts in Bristol, UK 
      with signs and symptoms of respiratory disease. Patients who developed symptoms 
      before receiving their vaccine or those who received their vaccine after 
      admission to hospital were excluded, as were those with symptoms that started 
      more than 10 days before hospital admission. We did logistic regression analysis, 
      controlling for time (week), sex, index of multiple deprivations, and care 
      residency status, and sensitivity analyses matched for time and sex using a 
      conditional logistic model adjusting for index of multiple deprivations and care 
      residency status. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number 39557. FINDINGS: 
      Between Dec 18, 2020, and Feb 26, 2021, 466 adults were eligible (144 
      test-positive and 322 test-negative). 18 (13%) of 135 people with SARS-CoV-2 
      infection and 90 (34%) of 269 controls received one dose of BNT162b2. The 
      adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 71·4% (95% CI 46·5-90·6). Nine (25%) of 36 
      people with COVID-19 infection and 53 (59%) of 90 controls received one dose of 
      ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. The adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 80·4% (95% CI 36·4-94·5). 
      When BNT162b2 effectiveness analysis was restricted to the period covered by 
      ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the estimate was 79·3% (95% CI 47·0-92·5). INTERPRETATION: One 
      dose of either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 resulted in substantial risk 
      reductions of COVID-19-related hospitalisation in people aged at least 80 years.

TI  - Effectiveness of heterologous third and fourth dose COVID-19 vaccine schedules

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has evolved quickly, 
      with numerous waves of different variants of concern resulting in the need for 
      countries to offer continued protection through booster vaccination. To ensure 
      adequate vaccination coverage, Thailand has proactively adopted heterologous 
      vaccination schedules. While randomised controlled trials have assessed 
      homologous schedules in detail, limited data has been reported for heterologous 
      vaccine effectiveness (VE). METHODS: Utilising a unique active surveillance 
      network established in Chiang Mai, Northern Thailand, we conducted a 
      test-negative case control study to assess the VE of heterologous third and 
      fourth dose schedules against SARS-CoV-2 infection among suspect-cases during Oct 
      1-Dec 31, 2021 (delta-predominant) and Feb 1-Apr 10, 2022 (omicron-predominant) 
      periods. FINDINGS: After a third dose, effectiveness against delta infection was 
      high (adjusted VE 97%, 95% CI 94-99%) in comparison to moderate protection 
      against omicron (adjusted VE 31%, 95% CI 26-36%). Good protection was observed 
      after a fourth dose (adjusted VE 75%, 95% CI 71-80%). VE was consistent across 
      age groups for both delta and omicron infection. The VE of third or fourth doses 
      against omicron infection were equivalent for the three main vaccines used for 
      boosting in Thailand, suggesting coverage, rather than vaccine type is a much 
      stronger predictor of protection. INTERPRETATION: Appropriately timed booster 
      doses have a high probability of preventing COVID-19 infection with both delta 
      and omicron variants. Our evidence supports the need for ongoing national efforts 
      to increase population coverage of booster doses. FUNDING: This research was 
      supported by the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT) under The Smart 
      Emergency Care Services Integration (SECSI) project to Faculty of Public Health 
      Chiang Mai University.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: A strategy that prioritizes individuals for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination 
      according to their risk of SARS-CoV-2-related mortality would help minimize 
      deaths during vaccine rollout. OBJECTIVE: To develop a model that estimates the 
      risk of SARS-CoV-2-related mortality among all enrollees of the US Department of 
      Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 
      prognostic study used data from 7 635 064 individuals enrolled in the VA health 
      care system as of May 21, 2020, to develop and internally validate a logistic 
      regression model (COVIDVax) that predicted SARS-CoV-2-related death (n = 2422) 
      during the observation period (May 21 to November 2, 2020) using baseline 
      characteristics known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2-related mortality, 
      extracted from the VA electronic health records (EHRs). The cohort was split into 
      a training period (May 21 to September 30) and testing period (October 1 to 
      November 2). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: SARS-CoV-2-related death, defined as 
      death within 30 days of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. VA EHR data streams were 
      imported on a data integration platform to demonstrate that the model could be 
      executed in real-time to produce dashboards with risk scores for all current VA 
      enrollees. RESULTS: Of 7 635 064 individuals, the mean (SD) age was 66.2 (13.8) 
      years, and most were men (7 051 912 [92.4%]) and White individuals (4 887 338 
      [64.0%]), with 1 116 435 (14.6%) Black individuals and 399 634 (5.2%) Hispanic 
      individuals. From a starting pool of 16 potential predictors, 10 were included in 
      the final COVIDVax model, as follows: sex, age, race, ethnicity, body mass index, 
      Charlson Comorbidity Index, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart 
      failure, and Care Assessment Need score. The model exhibited excellent 
      discrimination with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
      (AUROC) of 85.3% (95% CI, 84.6%-86.1%), superior to the AUROC of using age alone 
      to stratify risk (72.6%; 95% CI, 71.6%-73.6%). Assuming vaccination is 90% 
      effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2-related death, using this model to prioritize 
      vaccination was estimated to prevent 63.5% of deaths that would occur by the time 
      50% of VA enrollees are vaccinated, significantly higher than the estimate for 
      prioritizing vaccination based on age (45.6%) or the US Centers for Disease 
      Control and Prevention phases of vaccine allocation (41.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: In this prognostic study of all VA enrollees, prioritizing vaccination 
      based on the COVIDVax model was estimated to prevent a large proportion of deaths 
      expected to occur during vaccine rollout before sufficient herd immunity is 
      achieved.

TI  - Effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine Boosters Against Infection, 
      Hospitalization, and Death: A Target Trial Emulation in the Omicron (B.1.1.529) 
      Variant Era.
PG  - 1693-1706
LID - 10.7326/M22-1856 [doi]
LID - M22-1856
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of a third mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose (booster 
      dose) against the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant is uncertain, especially in older, 
      high-risk populations. OBJECTIVE: To determine mRNA booster vaccine effectiveness 
      (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and death in the Omicron era 
      by booster type, primary vaccine type, time since primary vaccination, age, and 
      comorbidity burden. DESIGN: Retrospective matched cohort study designed to 
      emulate a target trial of booster vaccination versus no booster, conducted from 1 
      December 2021 to 31 March 2022. SETTING: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs 
      health care system. PARTICIPANTS: Persons who had received 2 mRNA COVID-19 
      vaccine doses at least 5 months earlier. INTERVENTION: Booster monovalent mRNA 
      vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech's BNT162b2 or Moderna's mRNA-1273) versus no 
      booster. MEASUREMENTS: Booster VE. RESULTS: Each group included 490 838 
      well-matched persons, who were predominantly male (88%), had a mean age of 63.0 
      years (SD, 14.0), and were followed for up to 121 days (mean, 79.8 days). Booster 
      VE more than 10 days after a booster dose was 42.3% (95% CI, 40.6% to 43.9%) 
      against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 53.3% (CI, 48.1% to 58.0%) against 
      SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization, and 79.1% (CI, 71.2% to 84.9%) against 
      SARS-CoV-2-related death. Booster VE was similar for different booster types 
      (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273), age groups, and primary vaccination regimens but was 
      significantly higher with longer time since primary vaccination and higher 
      comorbidity burden. LIMITATION: Predominantly male population. CONCLUSION: 
      Booster mRNA vaccination was highly effective in preventing death and moderately 
      effective in preventing infection and hospitalization for up to 4 months after 
      administration in the Omicron era. Increased uptake of booster vaccination, which 
      is currently suboptimal, should be pursued to limit the morbidity and mortality 
      of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in persons with high comorbidity burden.

AB  - Real-world analysis of the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection post vaccination is 
      important in determining the comparative effectiveness of the available vaccines. 
      In this retrospective cohort study using deidentified administrative claims for 
      Medicare Advantage and commercially insured individuals in a research database we 
      examine over 3.5 million fully vaccinated individuals, including 8,848 
      individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a follow-up period between 14 and 151 
      days after their second dose. Our primary outcome was the rate of Covid-19 
      infection occurring at 30, 60, and 90 days at least 14 days after the second dose 
      of either the mRNA-1273 vaccine or the BNT162b2 vaccine. Sub-analyses included 
      the incidence of hospitalization, ICU admission, and death/hospice transfer. 
      Separate analysis was conducted for individuals above and below age 65 and those 
      without a prior diagnosis of Covid-19. We show that immunization with mRNA-1273, 
      compared to BNT162b2, provides slightly more protection against SARS-CoV-2 
      infection that reaches statistical significance at 90 days with a number needed 
      to vaccinate of >290. There are no differences in vaccine effectiveness for 
      protection against hospitalization, ICU admission, or death/hospice transfer (aOR 
      1.23, 95% CI (0.67, 2.25)).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with Glycogen Storage Disease type II (GSDII), an 
      inheritable metabolic myopathy also known as Pompe disease, are considered to be 
      at risk for severe COVID-19 due to a reduced respiratory function and a tendency 
      to be overweight. However, so far little is known about the course of SARS-CoV-2 
      infection and side effects of COVID-19 vaccinations in patients with GSDII. 
      METHODS: 169 Dutch Pompe patients are followed at the Erasmus MC Rotterdam. 
      During the COVID-19 pandemic patients were requested to directly inform their 
      physicians about SARS-CoV-2 infection. Infected patients were interviewed 
      regularly by telephone until their symptoms subsided. Furthermore, all patients 
      eligible for vaccination on 16-7-2021 (≥ 17 years, n = 122) were asked to 
      complete a questionnaire. RESULTS: To date, fifteen patients (8.9% of our cohort) 
      reported a SARS-CoV-2 infection (classic infantile Pompe disease n = 5, late 
      onset n = 10). No patients were admitted to hospital or needed intensivation of 
      ventilatory support. All patients made a recovery within 19 days. 41.8% of 
      patients filled in our questionnaire regarding vaccination, of whom 98% were 
      vaccinated. Besides one case of perimyocarditis, only mild side effects were 
      reported. CONCLUSION: Overall, patients with Pompe disease showed mild symptoms 
      from infection with SARS-CoV-2. All patients made a full recovery. Side effects 
      after vaccination were mostly mild.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with cirrhosis.
PG  - 1470-1479

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical efficacy and safety of vaccination against novel 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with cirrhosis have not been 
      evaluated yet. AIM: To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of vaccination 
      against COVID-19 in patients with cirrhosis. METHODS: This was a retrospective 
      cohort study of patients with cirrhosis. The first cohort included patients 
      vaccinated with Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V); the second one consisted of 
      unvaccinated controls. RESULTS: The study included 89 vaccinated patients and 148 
      unvaccinated ones. There were 4 cases of COVID-19 in the vaccinated group and 24 
      cases in the unvaccinated group (P = 0.035). No severe cases of COVID-19 were 
      revealed in the vaccinated group, while there were 12 ones in the unvaccinated 
      group (P = 0.012) with 10 deaths detected (P = 0.012). The vaccine efficacy was 
      69.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 18.5%-94.4%) against symptomatic cases of 
      COVID-19, 100% (95%CI: 25.1%-100.0%) against severe cases, and 100% (95%CI: 
      1.6%-100.0%) against death associated with COVID-19. The efficacy of full 
      vaccination with revaccination against symptomatic cases of COVID-19 was 88.3% 
      (95%CI: 48.0%-99.6%). The overall mortality rate was higher in the unvaccinated 
      group than in the vaccinated group (17.1% vs 3.0%; P = 0.001). Higher 
      Child-Turcotte-Pugh class cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.13, 95%CI: 1.82-9.35) 
      and higher age (HR = 1.08, 95%CI: 1.04-1.15) were independent predictors of 
      overall mortality, while vaccination had a protective effect (HR = 0.09, 95%CI: 
      0.01-0.76). There was no significant difference in liver-related mortality (P = 
      0.135) or the incidence of liver decompensation (P = 0.077), bleeding esophageal 
      varices (P = 0.397), and vascular events (P = 0.651) between the two groups of 
      patients. CONCLUSION: Vaccination against COVID-19 in patients with cirrhosis is 
      effective and safe.

TI  - Safety and dose-sparing effect of Japanese encephalitis vaccine administered by 
      microneedle patch in uninfected, healthy adults (MNA-J): a randomised, partly 
      blinded, active-controlled, phase 1 trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether microneedle vaccinations of Japanese 
      encephalitis virus can induce sufficient neutralising antibodies and reduce the 
      amount of vaccine needed. We aimed to assess the safety and dose-sparing effect 
      of a microneedle vaccine patch against Japanese encephalitis in healthy 
      individuals who are naive to both the vaccine and natural infection. METHODS: The 
      MNA-J study was a randomised, partly blinded, active-controlled, phase 1 clinical 
      trial at Hokkaido University (Sapporo, Japan) that enrolled healthy adults aged 
      20-34 years with no history of Japanese encephalitis vaccination nor of infection 
      as confirmed by seronegativity. We excluded individuals who had been infected 
      with or vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis. Eligible participants were 
      randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three groups to receive inactivated Japanese 
      encephalitis vaccine administered twice, 3 weeks apart, by either 2·5 μg per 
      injection by subcutaneous injection, 0·63 μg per patch by high-dose microneedle 
      array (MNA-25%), or 0·25 μg per patch by low-dose microneedle array (MNA-10%). 
      The randomisation sequence, using stratification by cohort and blocks of six, was 
      computer-generated by a statistician who was unaware of group assignment. After 
      administration, the remaining amount of unadministered vaccine was measured by 
      ELISA and calculated as the delivered amount of vaccine. The primary outcome was 
      the neutralising antibody titre at day 42 after first immunisation. Successful 
      seroconversion was defined as post-vaccination titres of 1·3 (log(10)) or higher 
      in individuals whose pre-vaccination titres had been less than 1 (log(10)). This 
      study is registered with the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (s011190004). 
      FINDINGS: Between Aug 31 and Sept 2, 2019, 39 participants were enrolled and each 
      was randomly assigned to a group (n=13 per group). No serious adverse events were 
      observed. All participants in the microneedle array groups had a localised 
      erythematous reaction. The amount of vaccine delivered by microneedle array to 
      each participant was 0·63-1·15 μg (50-92%) of the full 1·26 μg for the MNA-25% 
      group and 0·25-0·41 μg (51-84%) of the full 0·50 μg for the MNA-10% group. All 
      participants demonstrated seroconversion at day 42, and the mean titres (log(10)) 
      were 2·55 for MNA-25%, 2·04 for MNA-10%, and 2·08 for subcutaneous injection. 
      INTERPRETATION: A microneedle patch of the Japanese encephalitis vaccine is safe, 
      well tolerated, and immunogenically effective. The dose-sparing effect suggests a 
      significant potential to reduce the amount of immunogens needed. However, 
      improved delivery is needed to make it more tolerable and user friendly. FUNDING:

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mass vaccination campaigns to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 
      (Covid-19) are occurring in many countries; estimates of vaccine effectiveness 
      are urgently needed to support decision making. A countrywide mass vaccination 
      campaign with the use of an inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine (CoronaVac) was conducted in Chile starting on 
      February 2, 2021. METHODS: We used a prospective national cohort, including 
      participants 16 years of age or older who were affiliated with the public 
      national health care system, to assess the effectiveness of the inactivated 
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccine with regard to preventing Covid-19 and related 
      hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and death. We 
      estimated hazard ratios using the extension of the Cox proportional-hazards 
      model, accounting for time-varying vaccination status. We estimated the change in 
      the hazard ratio associated with partial immunization (≥14 days after receipt of 
      the first dose and before receipt of the second dose) and full immunization (≥14 
      days after receipt of the second dose). Vaccine effectiveness was estimated with 
      adjustment for individual demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: The 
      study was conducted from February 2 through May 1, 2021, and the cohort included 
      approximately 10.2 million persons. Among persons who were fully immunized, the 
      adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 65.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.2 to 
      66.6) for the prevention of Covid-19 and 87.5% (95% CI, 86.7 to 88.2) for the 
      prevention of hospitalization, 90.3% (95% CI, 89.1 to 91.4) for the prevention of 
      ICU admission, and 86.3% (95% CI, 84.5 to 87.9) for the prevention of 
      Covid-19-related death. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the inactivated 
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectively prevented Covid-19, including severe disease and 
      death, a finding that is consistent with results of phase 2 trials of the 
      vaccine. (Funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo and others.).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several countries have authorised or begun using a booster vaccine 
      dose against COVID-19. Policy makers urgently need evidence of the effectiveness 
      of additional vaccine doses and its clinical spectrum for individuals with 
      complete primary immunisation schedules, particularly in countries where the 
      primary schedule used inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. METHODS: Using 
      individual-level data, we evaluated a prospective, observational, national-level 
      cohort of individuals (aged ≥16 years) affiliated with the Fondo Nacional de 
      Salud insurance programme in Chile, to assess the effectiveness of CoronaVac 
      (Sinovac Biotech), AZD1222 (Oxford-AstraZeneca), or BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) 
      vaccine boosters in individuals who had completed a primary immunisation schedule 
      with CoronaVac, compared with unvaccinated individuals. Individuals administered 
      vaccines from Feb 2, 2021, to the prespecified study end date of Nov 10, 2021, 
      were evaluated; we excluded individuals with a probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 
      infection (RT-PCR or antigen test) on or before Feb 2, 2021, and individuals who 
      had received at least one dose of any COVID-19 vaccine before Feb 2, 2021. We 
      estimated the vaccine effectiveness of booster doses against laboratory-confirmed 
      symptomatic COVID-19 (symptomatic COVID-19) cases and COVID-19 outcomes 
      (hospitalisation, admission to the intensive care unit [ICU], and death We used 
      inverse probability-weighted and stratified survival regression models to 
      estimate hazard ratios, accounting for time-varying vaccination status and 
      adjusting for relevant demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical confounders. We 
      estimated the change in hazard from unvaccinated status to vaccinated status 
      associated with the primary immunisation series and a booster vaccine. FINDINGS: 
      11 174 257 individuals were eligible for this study, among whom 4 127 546 
      completed a primary immunisation schedule (two doses) with CoronaVac and received 
      a booster dose during the study period. 1 921 340 (46·5%) participants received 
      an AZD1222 booster, 2 019 260 (48·9%) received a BNT162b2 booster, and 186 946 
      (4·5%) received a homologous booster with CoronaVac. We calculated an adjusted 
      vaccine effectiveness (weighted stratified Cox model) in preventing symptomatic 
      COVID-19 of 78·8% (95% CI 76·8-80·6) for a three-dose schedule with CoronaVac, 
      96·5% (96·2-96·7) for a BNT162b2 booster, and 93·2% (92·9-93·6) for an AZD1222 
      booster. The adjusted vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-related 
      hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death was 86·3% (83·7-88·5), 92·2% 
      (88·7-94·6), and 86·7% (80·5-91·0) for a homologous CoronaVac booster, 96·1% 
      (95·3-96·9), 96·2% (94·6-97·3), and 96·8% (93·9-98·3) for a BNT162b2 booster, and 
      97·7% (97·3-98·0), 98·9% (98·5-99·2), and 98·1% (97·3-98·6) for an AZD1222 
      booster. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that a homologous or heterologous 
      booster dose for individuals with a complete primary vaccination schedule with 
      CoronaVac provides a high level of protection against COVID-19, including severe 
      disease and death. Heterologous boosters showed higher vaccine effectiveness than 
      a homologous booster for all outcomes, providing additional support for a 
      mix-and-match approach. FUNDING: Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo

TI  - The Waning of BNT162b2 Vaccine Effectiveness for SARS-CoV-2 Infection Prevention 
      over Time: A Test-Negative Study in Health Care Professionals of a Health 
      Department from January 2021 to December 2021.

AB  - The duration of protection of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection has been 
      evaluated in previous studies, but uncertainty remains about the persistence of 
      effectiveness over time and the ideal timing for booster doses. Therefore, the 
      aim of this study was to evaluate BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness against 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers (HCWs) at a tertiary hospital 
      depending on time elapsed since the completion of a two-dose vaccination regimen. 
      We conducted a case-control with negative test study between 25 January and 12 
      December 2021 that included 1404 HCWs who underwent an active infection 
      diagnostic test (AIDT) to rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection due to COVID-19 suspicion 
      or prior close contact with patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The adjusted 
      vaccine effectiveness (aVE) for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection 12 to 120 
      days after completing the full two-dose vaccination regimen was 91.9%. Then, aVE 
      decreased to 63.7% between 121 to 240 days after completing the full two-dose 
      regimen and to 37.2% after 241 days since the second dose. Vaccination against 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs remains highly effective after 12 to 120 days have 
      elapsed since the administration of two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine; however, 
      effectiveness decreases as time elapses since its administration.

TI  - Comparison of infection-induced and vaccine-induced immunity against COVID-19 in 
      patients with cirrhosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 can be infection or vaccine-induced. 
      Cirrhosis is associated with vaccine hyporesponsiveness, but whether there is 
      decreased immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection in unvaccinated patients with 
      cirrhosis is unknown.The objective of our study was to compare infection-induced 
      and vaccine-induced immunity against COVID-19 among patients with cirrhosis. 
      METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study among US Veterans with cirrhosis 
      between November 27, 2020, and November 16, 2021, comparing a vaccine-induced 
      immunity group, defined as participants without a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      but fully vaccinated with two doses of an mRNA vaccine, and infection-associated 
      immunity group, defined as unvaccinated participants who had a positive 
      SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Both groups were propensity score 
      matched for observed characteristics, including location, and the date of the 
      immunity acquiring event, to control for the community prevalence of COVID-19 
      variants. The outcome was a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR more than 60 days after 
      previous infection in the infection-induced, or after full vaccination in the 
      vaccine-induced immunity group. RESULTS: We compared 634 participants in the 
      infection-induced immunity group with 27,131 participants in the vaccine-induced 
      immunity group using inverse propensity of treatment weighting. Vaccine-induced 
      immunity was associated with a reduced odds of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.20, p 
      < 0.0001). On multivariable logistic regression, vaccine-induced immunity was 
      associated with reduced odds of developing symptomatic (adjusted odds ratio 
      [aOR], 0.36; 95% CI, 0.33-0.41, p < 0.0001), moderate/severe/critical (aOR, 0.27; 
      95% CI, 0.22-0.31, p < 0.0001), and severe or critical COVID-19 (aOR, 0.20; 95% 
      CI, 0.16-0.26, p < 0.001), compared with infection-induced immunity. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In participants with cirrhosis, vaccine-induced immunity is associated with 
      reduced risk of developing COVID-19, compared with infection-induced immunity.

TI  - Vaccine effectiveness to protect against moderate or severe disease in COVID 
      cases: A prospective cohort study.
LID - 10.1016/j.mjafi.2022.02.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of partial 
      and full vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (COVISHIELD) to prevent the development 
      of moderate or severe illness among COVID-positive cases. METHODS: This 
      prospective cohort study was conducted among Armed Forces personnel deployed in 
      Northern India who were found COVID positive during the study period between 
      January and June 2021. Information about the vaccination status, age 
      and comorbidities was collected at the time of diagnosis. Classification of COVID 
      cases as moderate or severe was performed as per criteria given by the Government 
      of India. Individuals were considered partially vaccinated three weeks after one 
      dose and fully vaccinated two weeks after the second dose. Risk ratio and vaccine 
      effectiveness (VE) to prevent moderate or severe disease among COVID cases were 
      calculated. RESULTS: A total of 2005 COVID-19 patients were included in our 
      study. Partial vaccination and full vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 offered 13% 
      (95% credible interval (CI): -56.8%, 52.8%) and 66.6% (95% CI: 34.9%, 84.6%) 
      protection against progression to moderate/severe illness among COVID-positive 
      individuals. The risk of moderate-severe disease among COVID-positive cases 
      occurring 4-11 weeks after the first dose was also lesser among those who had 
      taken the second dose of vaccine than individuals who have been vaccinated with 
      only one dose. CONCLUSION: Interval between the first and second doses of ChAdOx1 
      nCoV-19 vaccine should be reduced to 4-6 weeks, as partial vaccination offers 
      lower protection against the development of moderate-severe illness after COVID 
      infection.

AB  - In South Korea, all 12th grade students (highs school seniors) were offered 
      BNT162b2 vaccine starting July 19, 2021; while 10(th)-11th grade students were 
      not eligible. We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study by to 
      determine the safety and effectiveness of BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in 
      adolescents against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among 444,313 persons who received the 
      first dose of vaccine, reporting rate for myocarditis and/or pericarditis was 1.8 
      per 100,000 (95% C.I. 0.8-3.5) among first-dose recipients and 4.3 per 100,000 
      (95% C.I. 2.6-6.7) in second-dose recipients. Vaccine effectiveness against 
      symptomatic/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection 14 days post-first dose vaccination 
      was 91.1% (95% C.I. 89.6-92.5), and 14 days post-second dose was 99.1% (95% C.I. 
      98.5-99.5). In this retrospective cohort study, BNT162b2 vaccination was safe and 
      was associated with a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
      suggesting that vaccination in adolescent may reduce the burden of Covid-19.

AB  - RESEARCH QUESTION: Do elective oocyte cryopreservation outcomes in women 1-13 
      months after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination alter compared with unvaccinated women and do 
      different time intervals between vaccination and ovarian stimulation impact these 
      outcomes? DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study, conducted in a 
      university-affiliated IVF centre, included 232 elective oocyte cryopreservation 
      cycles of vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, without previous infection with 
      the SARS-CoV-2 virus, between December 2020 and January 2022. Two control groups 
      - pre-pandemic (January 2019 to February 2020) and intra-pandemic (December 2020 
      to January 2022) unvaccinated groups - were compared with the vaccinated group, 
      further divided into four subgroups (under 3, 3-6, 6-9 and 9-13 months). The 
      primary outcome was the elective oocyte cryopreservation cycle outcomes - number 
      of retrieved and number of mature oocytes. RESULTS: The vaccinated group 
      demonstrated comparable outcomes with regards to number of retrieved and mature 
      oocytes compared with the pre-pandemic and intra-pandemic unvaccinated groups 
      (12.6 ± 8.0 versus 13.0 ± 8.2 and 12.5 ± 7.4 retrieved and 10.1 ± 6.9 versus 
      9.5 ± 6.4 and 10.1 ± 6.3 mature oocytes, respectively; not significant for both). 
      Similar results were noted in a comparison between the intra-pandemic 
      unvaccinated group and the four vaccinated subgroups. No correlation was found 
      between the parameter of days from vaccination and cycle outcomes. Similarly, 
      analysis of covariance showed no association between vaccination status and 
      timing and number of mature oocytes. CONCLUSIONS: The SARS-CoV-2 vaccination does 
      not alter the outcomes of elective oocyte cryopreservation procedures. This is 
      true even in a relatively long time interval of 9 to 13 months from vaccination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reports suggest that COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness is decreasing, 
      but whether this reflects waning or new SARS-CoV-2 variants-especially delta 
      (B.1.617.2)-is unclear. We investigated the association between time since two 
      doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in Scotland 
      (where delta was dominant), with comparative analyses in Brazil (where delta was 
      uncommon). METHODS: In this retrospective, population-based cohort study in 
      Brazil and Scotland, we linked national databases from the EAVE II study in 
      Scotland; and the COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign, Acute Respiratory Infection 
      Suspected Cases, and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection/Illness datasets in 
      Brazil) for vaccination, laboratory testing, clinical, and mortality data. We 
      defined cohorts of adults (aged ≥18 years) who received two doses of ChAdOx1 
      nCoV-19 and compared rates of severe COVID-19 outcomes (ie, COVID-19 hospital 
      admission or death) across fortnightly periods, relative to 2-3 weeks after the 
      second dose. Entry to the Scotland cohort started from May 19, 2021, and entry to 
      the Brazil cohort started from Jan 18, 2021. Follow-up in both cohorts was until 
      Oct 25, 2021. Poisson regression was used to estimate rate ratios (RRs) and 
      vaccine effectiveness, with 95% CIs. FINDINGS: 1 972 454 adults received two 
      doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in Scotland and 42 558 839 in Brazil, with longer 
      follow-up in Scotland because two-dose vaccination began earlier in Scotland than 
      in Brazil. In Scotland, RRs for severe COVID-19 increased to 2·01 (95% CI 
      1·54-2·62) at 10-11 weeks, 3·01 (2·26-3·99) at 14-15 weeks, and 5·43 (4·00-7·38) 
      at 18-19 weeks after the second dose. The pattern of results was similar in 
      Brazil, with RRs of 2·29 (2·01-2·61) at 10-11 weeks, 3·10 (2·63-3·64) at 14-15 
      weeks, and 4·71 (3·83-5·78) at 18-19 weeks after the second dose. In Scotland, 
      vaccine effectiveness decreased from 83·7% (95% CI 79·7-87·0) at 2-3 weeks, to 
      75·9% (72·9-78·6) at 14-15 weeks, and 63·7% (59·6-67·4) at 18-19 weeks after the 
      second dose. In Brazil, vaccine effectiveness decreased from 86·4% (85·4-87·3) at 
      2-3 weeks, to 59·7% (54·6-64·2) at 14-15 weeks, and 42·2% (32·4-50·6) at 18-19 
      weeks. INTERPRETATION: We found waning vaccine protection of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 
      against COVID-19 hospital admissions and deaths in both Scotland and Brazil, this 
      becoming evident within three months of the second vaccine dose. Consideration 
      needs to be given to providing booster vaccine doses for people who have received 
      ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. FUNDING: UK Research and Innovation (Medical Research Council),

TI  - COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
      severe COVID-19 outcomes from Delta AY.4.2: Cohort and test-negative study of 5.4 
      million individuals in Scotland.
PG  - 05025

AB  - BACKGROUND: In July 2021, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2) in the Delta lineage was detected in the United Kingdom 
      (UK), named AY.4.2 or "Delta plus". By October 2021, the AY.4.2 variant accounted 
      for approximately 10-11% of cases in the UK. AY.4.2 was designated as a variant 
      under investigation by the UK Health and Security Agency on 20 October 2021. This 
      study aimed to investigate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic 
      COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) infection and COVID-19 hospitalisation/death 
      for the AY.4.2 variant. METHODS: We used the Scotland-wide Early Pandemic 
      Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance (EAVE-II) platform to estimate the VE of the 
      ChAdOx1, BNT162b2, and mRNA-1273 vaccines against symptomatic infection and 
      severe COVID-19 outcomes in adults. The study was conducted from June 8 to 
      October 25, 2021. We used a test-negative design (TND) to estimate VE against 
      reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed symptomatic 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection while adjusting for sex, socioeconomic status, number of 
      coexisting conditions, and splines in time and age. We also performed a cohort 
      study using a Cox proportional hazards model to estimate VE against a composite 
      outcome of COVID-19 hospital admission or death, with the same adjustments. 
      RESULTS: We found an overall VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection due to 
      AY.4.2 of 73% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 62-81) for >14 days post-second 
      vaccine dose. Good protection against AY.4.2 symptomatic infection was observed 
      for BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, and mRNA-1273. In unvaccinated individuals, the hazard 
      ratio (HR) for COVID-19 hospital admission or death from AY.4.2 among community 
      detected cases was 1.77 (95% CI = 1.02-3.07) relative to unvaccinated individuals 
      who were infected with Delta, after adjusting for multiple potential confounders. 
      VE against AY.4.2 COVID-19 admissions or deaths was 87% (95% CI = 74-93) >28 days 
      post-second vaccination relative to unvaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: We found that 
      AY.4.2 was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalisations or 
      deaths in unvaccinated individuals compared with Delta and that vaccination 
      provided substantial protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 and severe 
      COVID-19 outcomes following Delta AY.4.2 infection. High levels of vaccine uptake 
      and protection offered by existing vaccines, as well as the rapid emergence of 
      the Omicron variant may have contributed to the AY.4.2 variant never progressing 
      to a variant of concern.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cirrhosis has been reported as an important risk factor for death in 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease. In this study, we aimed to 
      investigate the effects of COVID-19 on the natural course of cirrhosis before and 
      after starting vaccination. METHODS: The cirrhosis patients in our cohort (n: 
      140; median age:56; 71 female) were included in this study. The median MELD 
      (Model For End-stage Liver Disease) score was 11 (6-25) and CCI (Charlson 
      Comorbidity Index) score was 4 (1-11). In total, 85 had CTP 
      (Child-Turcotte-Pugh)-A, 44 had CTP-B and 11 had CTP-C cirrhosis. The course of 
      COVID-19 in this patient group was evaluated before and after COVID-19 
      vaccination. RESULTS: Between March 2020 and January 2021, 36 of the 140 
      cirrhosis patients had developed COVID-19. Cirrhosis (+)/COVID-19 (+) and 
      Cirrhosis (+)/COVID-19 (-) groups did not differ in terms of age, CCI and MELD-Na 
      scores, or gender. There were six deaths in the Cirrhosis (+)/COVID-19 (+) group 
      and five in the Cirrhosis (+)/COVID-19 (-) group [6/36 (16.6%) vs. 5/104 (4.8%); 
      p: 0.03]. Patients who died were older, had higher CCI and MELD-Na scores, and 
      lower albumin levels. Having had COVID-19 [6.45 (1.43-29.4); p: 0.015], higher 
      MELD-Na score [1.35 (1.18-1.60); p: 0.001] and higher CCI score [1.65 
      (1.14-2.39); p: 0.008] were found to be independent predictors of mortality. 
      After effective vaccination started in Turkey, only 11 of the remaining 129 
      patients developed COVID-19, and only one patient died, who was unvaccinated. 
      DISCUSSION: In our cirrhotic cohort, COVID-19 disease was associated with 16% 
      mortality in the pre-vaccination period. COVID-19 vaccination prevents serious 
      illness and death due to COVID-19 in cirrhotic patients.

TI  - Estimated BNT162b2 Vaccine Effectiveness Against Infection With Delta and Omicron 
      Variants Among US Children 5 to 11 Years of Age.
PG  - e2246915
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.46915 [doi]
LID - e2246915
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Data describing the vaccine effectiveness (VE) and durability of 
      BNT162b2 among children 5 to 11 years of age are needed. OBJECTIVE: To estimate 
      BNT162b2 VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection among children aged 5 to 11 years during 
      Delta and Omicron variant-predominant periods and to further assess VE according 
      to prior SARS-CoV-2 infection status and by sublineage during the Omicron 
      variant-predominant period. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This test-negative 
      case-control study was conducted from November 2 to December 9, 2021 (Delta 
      variant), and from January 16 to September 30, 2022 (Omicron variant), among 
      160 002 children tested at a large national US retail pharmacy chain, for 
      SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase chain reaction (PCR); 62 719 children were tested 
      during the Delta period, and 97 283 were tested during the Omicron period. 
      EXPOSURE: Vaccination with BNT162b2 before SARS-CoV-2 testing vs no vaccination. 
      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      confirmed by PCR (regardless of the presence of symptoms), and the secondary 
      outcome was confirmed symptomatic infection. Adjusted estimated VE was calculated 
      from multilevel logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 39 117 children 
      tested positive and 131 686 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (total, 170 803; 
      84 487 [49%] were boys; mean [SD] age was 9 [2] years; 74 236 [43%] were White 
      non-Hispanic or non-Latino; and 37 318 [22%] were Hispanic or Latino). Final VE 
      analyses included 160 002 children without SARS-CoV-2 infection less than 90 days 
      prior. The VE of 2 doses of BNT162b2 against Delta was 85% (95% CI, 80%-89%; 
      median follow-up, 1 month) compared with the Omicron period (20% [95% CI, 
      17%-23%]; median follow-up, 4 months). The adjusted VE of 2 doses against Omicron 
      at less than 3 months was 39% (95% CI, 36%-42%), and at 3 months or more, it was 
      -1% (95% CI, -6% to 3%). Protection against Omicron was higher among children 
      with vs without infection 90 days or more prior but decreased in all children 
      approximately 3 months after the second dose (58% [95% CI, 49%-66%] with 
      infection vs 37% [95% CI, 34%-41%] without infection at <3 months; 27% [95% CI, 
      17%-35%] with infection vs -7% [95% CI, -12% to -1%] at ≥3 months without 
      infection). The VE of 2 doses of BNT162b2 at less than 3 months by Omicron 
      sublineage was 40% (95% CI, 36%-43%) for BA.1, 32% (95% CI, 21%-41%) for 
      BA.2/BA.2.12.1, and 50% (95% CI, 37%-60%) for BA.4/BA.5. After 3 months or more, 
      VE was nonsignificant for BA.2/BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5. The VE of a booster dose 
      was 55% (95% CI, 50%-60%) against Omicron, with no evidence of waning at 3 months 
      or more. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that, among children aged 
      5 to 11 years, 2 doses of BNT162b2 provided modest short-term protection against 
      Omicron infection that was higher for those with prior infection; however, VE 
      waned after approximately 3 months in all children. A booster dose restored 
      protection against Omicron and was maintained for at least 3 months. These 
      findings highlight the continued importance of booster vaccination regardless of 
      history of prior COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly expanded; however, clinical trials 
      excluded patients taking immunosuppressive medications such as those with 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therefore, we explored real-world effectiveness 
      of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination on subsequent infection in 
      patients with IBD with diverse exposure to immunosuppressive medications. 
      METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients in the Veterans Health 
      Administration with IBD diagnosed before December 18, 2020, the start date of the 
      Veterans Health Administration patient vaccination program. IBD medication 
      exposures included mesalamine, thiopurines, anti-tumor necrosis factor biologic 
      agents, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, tofacitinib, methotrexate, and corticosteroid 
      use. We used inverse probability weighting and Cox's regression with vaccination 
      status as a time-updating exposure and computed vaccine effectiveness from 
      incidence rates. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 14,697 patients, 7321 of whom 
      received at least 1 vaccine dose (45.2% Pfizer, 54.8% Moderna). The cohort had 
      median age 68 years, 92.2% were men, 80.4% were White, and 61.8% had ulcerative 
      colitis. In follow-up data through April 20, 2021, unvaccinated individuals had 
      the highest raw proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection (197 [1.34%] vs 7 [0.11%] 
      fully vaccinated). Full vaccination status, but not partial vaccination status, 
      was associated with a 69% reduced hazard of infection relative to an unvaccinated 
      status (hazard ratio, 0.31, 95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.56; P < .001), 
      corresponding to an 80.4% effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Full vaccination (> 7 days 
      after the second dose) against SARS-CoV-2 infection has an ∼80.4% effectiveness 
      in a broad IBD cohort with diverse exposure to immunosuppressive medications. 
      These results may serve to increase patient and provider willingness to pursue 
      vaccination in these settings.

TI  - COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness Against the Omicron Variant in a Veterans Affairs 
      Cohort of Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
LID - 10.14309/ajg.0000000000002071 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: With the advent of the Omicron variant, there are concerns about 
      the efficacy of current vaccinations, especially among 
      immunocompromised/immunosuppressed patients. Our aim was to determine the 
      efficacy of the first booster dose against Omicron. METHODS: This was a 
      retrospective cohort study using a well-established inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD) cohort in the Veterans Health Administration. We followed patients on 
      baseline IBD medications through the month of January 2022 during the Omicron 
      COVID-19 wave and created adjusted models for vaccination and boosting 
      effectiveness in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and all-cause 
      mortality. RESULTS: A total of 22,756 patients with IBD were included, of whom 
      34.9% had received a booster dose. During follow-up, 622 patients (2.7%) were 
      diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In adjusted models, booster status was 
      associated with a 30% reduced hazard of SARS-CoV-2 infection (hazard ratio 0.70 
      vs unvaccinated status, 95% confidence interval 0.56-0.88, P = 0.002), 
      translating to 25.05% effectiveness. Boosted status was also significantly 
      associated with reduced COVID-19 hospitalization (hazard ratio 0.35, 95% 
      confidence interval 0.16-0.74, P = 0.006), demonstrating a 65.06% effectiveness 
      in adjusted models. There was no significant association between vaccination 
      status and all-cause mortality in adjusted models. DISCUSSION: The boosted state 
      was associated with a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related 
      hospitalization. Efficacy was lower than what has been seen against previous 
      variants and decreased with prolonged duration from the booster. These findings 
      suggest that patients with IBD, especially those who are immunosuppressed, should 
      consider getting a second booster as per Centers for Disease Control and 
      Prevention recommendations.

TI  - Effectiveness of two and three mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses against Omicron- and 
      Delta-Related outpatient illness among adults, October 2021-February 2022.
PG  - 975-985
LID - 10.1111/irv.13029 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We estimated SARS-CoV-2 Delta- and Omicron-specific effectiveness of 
      two and three mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses in adults against symptomatic illness 
      in US outpatient settings. METHODS: Between October 1, 2021, and February 12, 
      2022, research staff consented and enrolled eligible participants who had fever, 
      cough, or loss of taste or smell and sought outpatient medical care or clinical 
      SARS-CoV-2 testing within 10 days of illness onset. Using the test-negative 
      design, we compared the odds of receiving two or three mRNA COVID-19 vaccine 
      doses among SARS-CoV-2 cases versus controls using logistic regression. 
      Regression models were adjusted for study site, age, onset week, and prior 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated as (1 - adjusted 
      odds ratio) × 100%. RESULTS: Among 3847 participants included for analysis, 574 
      (32%) of 1775 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the Delta predominant period 
      and 1006 (56%) of 1794 participants tested positive during the Omicron 
      predominant period. When Delta predominated, VE against symptomatic illness in 
      outpatient settings was 63% (95% CI: 51% to 72%) among mRNA two-dose recipients 
      and 96% (95% CI: 93% to 98%) for three-dose recipients. When Omicron 
      predominated, VE was 21% (95% CI: -6% to 41%) among two-dose recipients and 62% 
      (95% CI: 48% to 72%) among three-dose recipients. CONCLUSIONS: In this adult 
      population, three mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses provided substantial protection 
      against symptomatic illness in outpatient settings when the Omicron variant 
      became the predominant cause of COVID-19 in the United States. These findings 
      support the recommendation for a third mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose.

AB  - Despite the availability of the ChAdOx1-S booster vaccine, little is known about 
      the real-world effectiveness although clinical trials have demonstrated enhanced 
      immunity following a ChAdOx1-S booster. In England 43,171 individuals received a 
      ChAdOx1-S booster whilst 13,038,908 individuals received BNT162b2 in the same 
      period. ChAdOx1-S booster recipients were more likely to be female (adjusted odds 
      ratio (OR) 1.67 (1.64-1.71)), in a clinical risk group (adjusted OR 1.58 
      (1.54-1.63)), in the clinically extremely vulnerable group (adjusted OR 1.84 
      (1.79-1.89)) or severely immunosuppressed (adjusted OR 2.05 (1.96-2.13)). The 
      effectiveness of the ChAdOx1-S and BNT162b2 boosters is estimated here using a 
      test-negative case-control study. Protection against symptomatic disease with the 
      Omicron variant peaks at 66.1% (16.6 to 86.3%) and 68.5% (65.7 to 71.2%) for the 
      ChAdOx1-S and BNT162b2 boosters in older adults. Protection against 
      hospitalisation peaks at 82.3% (64.2 to 91.3%) and 90.9% (88.7 to 92.7%). For 
      Delta, effectiveness against hospitalisation is 80.9% (15.6% to 95.7%) and 93.9% 
      (92.8% to 94.9%) after ChAdOx1-S and BNT162b2 booster vaccination. This study 
      supports the consideration of ChAdOx1-S booster vaccination for protection 
      against severe COVID-19 in settings yet to offer boosters and suggests that 
      individuals who received a ChAdOx1-S booster do not require re-vaccination ahead 
      of others.

TI  - Absence of association between 2019-20 influenza vaccination and COVID-19: 
      Results of the European I-MOVE-COVID-19 primary care project, March-August 2020.
PG  - 429-438
LID - 10.1111/irv.12839 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Claims of influenza vaccination increasing COVID-19 risk are 
      circulating. Within the I-MOVE-COVID-19 primary care multicentre study, we 
      measured the association between 2019-20 influenza vaccination and COVID-19. 
      METHODS: We conducted a multicentre test-negative case-control study at primary 
      care level, in study sites in five European countries, from March to August 2020. 
      Patients presenting with acute respiratory infection were swabbed, with 
      demographic, 2019-20 influenza vaccination and clinical information documented. 
      Using logistic regression, we measured the adjusted odds ratio (aOR), adjusting 
      for study site and age, sex, calendar time, presence of chronic conditions. The 
      main analysis included patients swabbed ≤7 days after onset from the three 
      countries with <15% of missing influenza vaccination. In secondary analyses, we 
      included five countries, using multiple imputation with chained equations to 
      account for missing data. RESULTS: We included 257 COVID-19 cases and 1631 
      controls in the main analysis (three countries). The overall aOR between 
      influenza vaccination and COVID-19 was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.66-1.32). The aOR was 0.92 
      (95% CI: 0.58-1.46) and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.51-1.67) among those aged 20-59 and 
      ≥60 years, respectively. In secondary analyses, we included 6457 cases and 69 272 
      controls. The imputed aOR was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.79-0.95) among all ages and any 
      delay between swab and symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that 
      COVID-19 cases were more likely to be vaccinated against influenza than controls. 
      Influenza vaccination should be encouraged among target groups for vaccination. 
      I-MOVE-COVID-19 will continue documenting influenza vaccination status in 
      2020-21, in order to learn about effects of recent influenza vaccination.

TI  - Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults aged 65 
      years and older in primary care: I-MOVE-COVID-19 project, Europe, December 2020 
      to May 2021.

AB  - We measured COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 
      infection at primary care/outpatient level among adults ≥ 65 years old using a 
      multicentre test-negative design in eight European countries. We included 592 
      SARS-CoV-2 cases and 4,372 test-negative controls in the main analysis. The VE 
      was 62% (95% CI: 45-74) for one dose only and 89% (95% CI: 79-94) for complete 
      vaccination. COVID-19 vaccines provide good protection against COVID-19 
      presentation at primary care/outpatient level, particularly among fully 
      vaccinated individuals.

TI  - Effectiveness of complete primary vaccination against COVID-19 at primary care 
      and community level during predominant Delta circulation in Europe: multicentre 
      analysis, I-MOVE-COVID-19 and ECDC networks, July to August 2021.

AB  - IntroductionIn July and August 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant dominated in 
      Europe.AimUsing a multicentre test-negative study, we measured COVID-19 vaccine 
      effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic infection.MethodsIndividuals with COVID-19 
      or acute respiratory symptoms at primary care/community level in 10 European 
      countries were tested for SARS-CoV-2. We measured complete primary course overall 
      VE by vaccine brand and by time since vaccination.ResultsOverall VE was 74% (95% 
      CI: 69-79), 76% (95% CI: 71-80), 63% (95% CI: 48-75) and 63% (95% CI: 16-83) 
      among those aged 30-44, 45-59, 60-74 and ≥ 75 years, respectively. VE among those 
      aged 30-59 years was 78% (95% CI: 75-81), 66% (95% CI: 58-73), 91% (95% CI: 
      87-94) and 52% (95% CI: 40-61), for Comirnaty, Vaxzevria, Spikevax and COVID-19 
      Vaccine Janssen, respectively. VE among people 60 years and older was 67% (95% 
      CI: 52-77), 65% (95% CI: 48-76) and 83% (95% CI: 64-92) for Comirnaty, Vaxzevria 
      and Spikevax, respectively. Comirnaty VE among those aged 30-59 years was 87% 
      (95% CI: 83-89) at 14-29 days and 65% (95% CI: 56-71%) at ≥ 90 days between 
      vaccination and onset of symptoms.ConclusionsVE against symptomatic infection 
      with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant varied among brands, ranging from 52% to 91%. 
      While some waning of the vaccine effect may be present (sample size limited this 
      analysis to only Comirnaty), protection was 65% at 90 days or more between 
      vaccination and onset.

TI  - The benefit of vaccination against COVID-19 outweighs the potential risk of 
      myocarditis and pericarditis.

AB  - Vaccines against coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) have shown to be greatly 
      effective in preventing viral spread, serious illness and death from this 
      infectious disease and are therefore critical for the management of the COVID-19 
      pandemic. However, the listing of myocarditis and pericarditis as possible rare 
      side effects of the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against COVID-19 by regulatory 
      agencies has sparked discussion on the vaccines' safety. The most important 
      published cohort studies to date demonstrat that myocarditis is a very rare side 
      effect after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, with an incidence of approximately 
      1-4 cases per 100,000 vaccinated persons. Young males (16-29 years) appear to be 
      at highest risk, predominantly after receiving the second dose. The disease 
      course is self-limiting in a vast majority of cases: 95% of patients show a rapid 
      resolution of symptoms and normalisation of cardiac biomarkers, electro- and 
      echocardiographic findings within days. Importantly, the available data suggest 
      that the incidence rate of myocarditis in the context of COVID-19 is much greater 
      than the risk of this side effect following vaccination. We conclude that the 
      benefit of vaccination against COVID-19 outweighs the potential risk of 
      myocarditis and pericarditis in both adolescents and adults. Prospective 
      follow-up of patients who have developed these complications after vaccination is 
      required to assess long-term outcomes.

TI  - Effectiveness of COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccination in Preventing 
      COVID-19-Associated Emergency Department and Urgent Care Encounters and 
      Hospitalizations Among Nonimmunocompromised Children and Adolescents Aged 5-17 
      Years - VISION Network, 10 States, April 2021-January 2022.
PG  - 352-358
LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm7109e3 [doi]
AB  - The efficacy of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine against 
      laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 exceeded 90% in clinical trials that included 
      children and adolescents aged 5-11, 12-15, and 16-17 years (1-3). Limited 
      real-world data on 2-dose mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) in persons aged 12-17 
      years (referred to as adolescents in this report) have also indicated high levels 
      of protection against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) infection and 
      COVID-19-associated hospitalization (4-6); however, data on VE against the 
      SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant and duration of protection are limited. 
      Pfizer-BioNTech VE data are not available for children aged 5-11 years. In 
      partnership with CDC, the VISION Network* examined 39,217 emergency department 
      (ED) and urgent care (UC) encounters and 1,699 hospitalizations(†) among persons 
      aged 5-17 years with COVID-19-like illness across 10 states during April 9, 
      2021-January 29, 2022,(§) to estimate VE using a case-control test-negative 
      design. Among children aged 5-11 years, VE against laboratory-confirmed 
      COVID-19-associated ED and UC encounters 14-67 days after dose 2 (the longest 
      interval after dose 2 in this age group) was 46%. Among adolescents aged 12-15 
      and 16-17 years, VE 14-149 days after dose 2 was 83% and 76%, respectively; VE 
      ≥150 days after dose 2 was 38% and 46%, respectively. Among adolescents aged 
      16-17 years, VE increased to 86% ≥7 days after dose 3 (booster dose). VE against 
      COVID-19-associated ED and UC encounters was substantially lower during the 
      Omicron predominant period than the B.1.617.2 (Delta) predominant period among 
      adolescents aged 12-17 years, with no significant protection ≥150 days after dose 
      2 during Omicron predominance. However, in adolescents aged 16-17 years, VE 
      during the Omicron predominant period increased to 81% ≥7 days after a third 
      booster dose. During the full study period, including pre-Delta, Delta, and 
      Omicron predominant periods, VE against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated 
      hospitalization among children aged 5-11 years was 74% 14-67 days after dose 2, 
      with wide CIs that included zero. Among adolescents aged 12-15 and 16-17 years, 
      VE 14-149 days after dose 2 was 92% and 94%, respectively; VE ≥150 days after 
      dose 2 was 73% and 88%, respectively. All eligible children and adolescents 
      should remain up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations, including a 
      booster dose for those aged 12-17 years.

TI  - The potential public health and economic value of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine 
      in the United States: Use of cost-effectiveness modeling to inform vaccination 
      prioritization.

LID - 10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.12.078 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Researchers are working at unprecedented speed to develop a 
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. We aimed to assess the value of a hypothetical vaccine and 
      its potential public health impact when prioritization is required due to supply 
      constraints. METHODS: A Markov cohort model was used to estimate COVID-19 related 
      direct medical costs and deaths in the United States (US), with and without 
      implementation of a 60% efficacious vaccine. To prioritize the vaccine under 
      constrained supply, the population was divided into tiers based on age; risk and 
      age; and occupation and age; and outcomes were compared across one year under 
      various supply assumptions. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year 
      (QALY) gained versus no vaccine was calculated for the entire adult population 
      and for each tier in the three prioritization schemes. RESULTS: The incremental 
      cost per QALY gained for the US adult population was $8,200 versus no 
      vaccination. For the tiers at highest risk of complications from COVID-19, such 
      as those ages 65 years and older, vaccination was cost-saving compared to no 
      vaccination. The cost per QALY gained increased to over $94,000 for those with a 
      low risk of hospitalization and death following infection. Results were most 
      sensitive to infection incidence, vaccine price, the cost of treating COVID-19, 
      and vaccine efficacy. Under the most optimistic supply scenario, the hypothetical 
      vaccine may prevent 31% of expected deaths. As supply becomes more constrained, 
      only 23% of deaths may be prevented. In lower supply scenarios, prioritization 
      becomes more important to maximize the number of deaths prevented. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      COVID-19 vaccine is predicted to be good value for money (cost per QALY gained 
      <$50,000). The speed at which an effective vaccine can be made available will 
      determine how much morbidity and mortality may be prevented in the US.

TI  - Determinants and Effectiveness of BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccination Among Patients with 
      Atopic Dermatitis: A Population-Based Study.
PG  - 385-392
LID - 10.1007/s40257-022-00672-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of messenger RNA coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) vaccines in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) is yet to be 
      delineated. It remains largely unknown how AD-related immunosuppressive 
      medications affect the development of vaccine-induced immunity. OBJECTIVE: We 
      aimed to evaluate the prevalence of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccine among 
      patients with AD and to assess its effectiveness in protecting against severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, 
      COVID-19-associated hospitalization, and mortality. A specific analysis 
      additionally examined whether AD-related immunosuppressive drugs influenced the 
      effectiveness of the vaccine. METHODS: A population-based cohort study was 
      performed using the database of Clalit Heath Services, Israel, to follow adult 
      patients with AD. Multivariate Cox and logistic regression analyses were utilized 
      to calculate the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) of the incident 
      outcomes. RESULTS: As of 26 June, 2021, 58,582 (75.4%) out of 77,682 adult 
      patients with AD completed two BNT162b2 vaccine doses in Israel. Adulthood-onset 
      AD (adjusted OR, 1.34; 95% CI 1.28-1.40; p < 0.001) and moderate-to-severe AD 
      (adjusted OR, 1.13; 95% CI 1.05-1.21; p = 0.001) predicted an increased 
      vaccination rate. Vaccinated patients with AD demonstrated a significantly 
      decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted HR, 0.20; 95% CI 0.16-0.26; p < 
      0.001), COVID-19-associated hospitalization (adjusted HR, 0.08; 95% CI 0.04-0.18; 
      p < 0.001), and COVID-19-associated mortality (adjusted HR, 0.04; 95% CI 
      0.01-0.20; p < 0.001). Exposure to immunosuppressive drugs (n = 597; 0.8% of 
      patients) did not impair the protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection after 
      vaccination (adjusted HR, 0.95; 95% CI 0.13-6.81; p = 0.958). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      patients with AD, COVID-19 vaccination is highly effective for a wide range of 
      COVID-19-related outcomes. Immunosuppressive drugs did not impair the 
      effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in this 
      retrospective analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess whether influenza vaccination 
      has an impact on the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A 
      cohort of 46 112 healthcare workers were tested for antibodies against severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and filled in a survey on 
      COVID-19 symptoms, hospitalization, and influenza vaccination. RESULTS: The risk 
      ratio of hospitalization due to SARS-CoV-2 for influenza vaccinated compared with 
      unvaccinated participants was 1.00 for the seasonal vaccination in 2019/2020 
      (confidence interval, .56-1.78, P = 1.00). Likewise, no clinical effect of 
      influenza vaccination on development of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was found. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The present findings indicate that influenza vaccination does not 
      affect the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19.

TI  - Large inter-individual variability of cellular and humoral immunological 
      responses to mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in health care 
      workers.
PG  - 96-103
LID - 10.7774/cevr.2022.11.1.96 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Studies on the immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 vaccines are necessary to evaluate the ongoing vaccination programs 
      by correlating serological response data and clinical effectiveness data. We 
      performed a longitudinal immunological profiling of health care workers 
      vaccinated with mRNA-1273 (Moderna, Cambridge, MA, USA). Half of these vaccinees 
      had experienced a mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in the 
      spring of 2020 ("COVID-recovered" cohort), whereas the other half of the 
      vaccinees had no previous COVID-19 infection ("COVID-naive" cohort). MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Serum was drawn at multiple time points and subjected to assays 
      measuring anti-Spike immunoglobulin G (IgG), avidity of anti-Spike IgG, avidity 
      of anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, virus neutralizing activity, and 
      interferon-γ release from stimulated lymphocytes. RESULTS: Between both cohorts 
      and within each cohort, we found remarkable inter-individual differences 
      regarding cellular and humoral immune responses to the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine. 
      CONCLUSION: First, our study indicates that the success of mRNA-1273 vaccinations 
      should be verified by serological assays in order to identify "low-responders" to 
      vaccination. Second, the kinetics of anti-S IgG and neutralizing activity 
      correlate well with clinical effectiveness data, thus explaining incipient 
      protection against infection 2 weeks after the first dose of mRNA-1273 in 
      COVID-naive vaccinees. Third, our IgG-avidity data indicate that this incipient 
      protection is mediated by low-avidity anti-RBD IgG and low-avidity anti-S IgG.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The study objective was to evaluate 2- and 3-dose coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing COVID-19 
      hospitalization among adult solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. METHODS: We 
      conducted a 21-site case-control analysis of 10 425 adults hospitalized in March 
      to December 2021. Cases were hospitalized with COVID-19; controls were 
      hospitalized for an alternative diagnosis (severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2-negative). Participants were classified as follows: SOT recipient 
      (n = 440), other immunocompromising condition (n = 1684), or immunocompetent 
      (n = 8301). The VE against COVID-19-associated hospitalization was calculated as 
      1-adjusted odds ratio of prior vaccination among cases compared with controls. 
      RESULTS: Among SOT recipients, VE was 29% (95% confidence interval [CI], -19% to 
      58%) for 2 doses and 77% (95% CI, 48% to 90%) for 3 doses. Among patients with 
      other immunocompromising conditions, VE was 72% (95% CI, 64% to 79%) for 2 doses 
      and 92% (95% CI, 85% to 95%) for 3 doses. Among immunocompetent patients, VE was 
      88% (95% CI, 87% to 90%) for 2 doses and 96% (95% CI, 83% to 99%) for 3 doses. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines was lower for SOT recipients 
      than immunocompetent adults and those with other immunocompromising conditions. 
      Among SOT recipients, vaccination with 3 doses of an mRNA vaccine led to 
      substantially greater protection than 2 doses.

TI  - Effectiveness of mRNA Booster Vaccination Against Mild, Moderate, and Severe 
      COVID-19 Caused by the Omicron Variant in a Large, Population-Based, Norwegian 
      Cohort.
PG  - 1924-1933
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiac419 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding how booster vaccination can prevent moderate and severe 
      illness without hospitalization is crucial to evaluate the full advantage of mRNA 
      boosters. METHODS: We followed 85 801 participants (aged 31-81 years) in 2 large 
      population-based cohorts during the Omicron BA.1/2 wave. Information on home 
      testing, PCR testing, and symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was 
      extracted from biweekly questionnaires covering the period 12 January 2022 to 7 
      April 2022. Vaccination status and data on previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were 
      obtained from national registries. Cox regression was used to estimate the 
      effectiveness of booster vaccination compared to receipt of 2-dose primary series 
      >130 days previously. RESULTS: The effectiveness of booster vaccination increased 
      with increasing severity of COVID-19 and decreased with time since booster 
      vaccination. The effectiveness against severe COVID-19 was reduced from 80.9% 
      shortly after booster vaccination to 63.4% in the period >90 days after 
      vaccination. There was hardly any effect against mild COVID-19. The effectiveness 
      tended to be lower among subjects aged ≥60 years than those aged <50 years. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first population-based study to evaluate booster 
      effectiveness against self-reported mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19. Our 
      findings contribute valuable information on duration of protection and thus 
      timing of additional booster vaccinations.

TI  - A Cohort Study on Influenza Vaccine and All-Cause Mortality in Older Adults: 
      Methodological Concerns and Public Health Implications.
PG  - 645-656
LID - 10.1007/s40266-022-00958-7 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In 2020, the restrictions adopted to control the severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic led to an unprecedented 
      reduction in influenza-related burden. As such, the reduced chance to 
      characterize the circulating virus strains might have increased the risk of 
      vaccine mismatch for the forthcoming winter seasons. The role of an effective 
      influenza vaccination campaign might therefore assume even more value, especially 
      for frail and multimorbid older individuals. Methodological concerns on 
      confounding by indication are always debated in vaccine effectiveness studies and 
      it might be instrumental to give a pragmatic message on an individual's 
      responsibility to receive the influenza vaccine. We therefore investigated the 
      role of specific confounders to explain the association between influenza vaccine 
      and mortality among older adults. METHODS: Using a primary care database, we 
      formed a cohort of patients aged 65 years or older who were actively registered 
      with their general practitioner (GP) at the beginning of each of nine influenza 
      seasons through to the 2018/2019 season. The study index date was the related 
      seasons' starting date. Exposure to the influenza vaccine was operationally 
      defined in the 2 months preceding the index date up to 2 weeks before the exit 
      date. Cox regression models were estimated to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 
      their 95% confidence intervals (CI) of death between vaccinated and unvaccinated 
      patients in a time-dependent fashion. The potential confounders sequentially 
      entered the model based on their increasing effect size observed in univariate 
      analyses. RESULTS: Over the 10 years under study, the influenza vaccine showed a 
      significant protective effect in terms of mortality, reaching 13% reduction (HR 
      0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.95) in the 2018/2019 influenza season. When we estimated the 
      multivariate model by sequentially adding the potential confounders, there was an 
      inversion of HR (below the unit) that was significantly explained by the 
      covariates coding for a prior history of lower respiratory tract infections and 
      the presence of the pneumococcal vaccine. CONCLUSION: In the current pandemic 
      scenario, we cannot divert attention to proper use of face masks, social 
      distancing, and hand hygiene, which are important measures to prevent influenza 
      and other respiratory viral infections. Nonetheless, their effectiveness might be 
      negligible without acceptable coverage for influenza vaccine, especially in older 
      patients with a history of lower respiratory tract infections, which appears to 
      be the main source of confounding by indication.

AB  - To evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 infection in health care workers from the 
      start of the COVID-19 pandemic in NE Italy, vaccination with BNT162b2. This was a 
      retrospective cohort study. Healthcare workers were routinely tested for 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection using real-time polymerase chain reaction tests in 
      nasopharyngeal swabs. Logistic regression was used to calculate the incidence 
      rate ratios (IRRs) of the factors associated with COVID-19. A total of 4251 
      workers were followed up, and the prevalence of COVID-19 was 13.6%. In March 2021 
      the incidence of infection was 4.88 and 103.55 cases for 100,000 person-days in 
      vaccinated and non-vaccinated workers, respectively, with an adjusted IRRs of 
      0.05 (95% CI 0.02-0.08). Our study evaluated the monthly incidence in health care 
      workers in Trieste hospitals before and after vaccination, finding an estimated 
      vaccine effectiveness of 95% in health care workers routinely tested.

TI  - Determinants of Actual COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake in a Cohort of Essential Workers: 
      An Area-Based Longitudinal Study in the Province of Prato, Italy.

AB  - Identifying determinants of COVID-19 vaccine uptake is essential for developing 
      effective strategies for promoting vaccination. This longitudinal study aimed to 
      explore predictors of actual COVID-19 vaccine uptake in workers involved in 
      essential services during the first lockdown period in the Prato Province 
      (Italy). All essential workers were invited and surveyed before COVID-19 vaccine 
      approval (96.5% participation rate). Participants were followed up to evaluate 
      their actual COVID-19 vaccination uptake using the vaccination register. 
      Multinomial models were performed to assess predictors of delayed vaccination or 
      non-vaccination. A total of 691 participants were included, of whom 21.7% had 
      delayed the vaccination and 4.4% were unvaccinated. Participants with a 
      sufficient level of health literacy were 50.2% in the vaccinated-on-time group 
      and 32.3% in the unvaccinated group. The multinomial model predictors of delayed 
      vaccination were work type (OR = 0.51), age between 50 and 59 years (OR = 1.82), 
      and influenza vaccination uptake in the last season (OR = 2.51). Predictors of 
      being unvaccinated were work type (OR = 0.33) and attitudes related to 
      attributing less importance to COVID-19 preventive measures (OR = 0.47). Findings 
      showed distinct predictors for COVID-19 vaccination delay and for being 
      unvaccinated. Being unvaccinated seems to be associated with a general skepticism 
      toward prevention measures.

TI  - Clinical Severity and mRNA Vaccine Effectiveness for Omicron, Delta, and Alpha 
      SARS-CoV-2 Variants in the United States: A Prospective Observational Study.
LID - 2022.02.06.22270558 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2022.02.06.22270558 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize the clinical severity of COVID-19 caused by Omicron, 
      Delta, and Alpha SARS-CoV-2 variants among hospitalized adults and to compare the 
      effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to prevent hospitalizations caused by 
      each variant. DESIGN: A case-control study of 11,690 hospitalized adults. 
      SETTING: Twenty-one hospitals across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: This study 
      included 5728 cases hospitalized with COVID-19 and 5962 controls hospitalized 
      without COVID-19. Cases were classified into SARS-CoV-2 variant groups based on 
      viral whole genome sequencing, and if sequencing did not reveal a lineage, by the 
      predominant circulating variant at the time of hospital admission: Alpha (March 
      11 to July 3, 2021), Delta (July 4 to December 25, 2021), and Omicron (December 
      26, 2021 to January 14, 2022). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vaccine effectiveness was 
      calculated using a test-negative design for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to prevent 
      COVID-19 hospitalizations by each variant (Alpha, Delta, Omicron). Among 
      hospitalized patients with COVID-19, disease severity on the WHO Clinical 
      Progression Ordinal Scale was compared among variants using proportional odds 
      regression. RESULTS: Vaccine effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines to prevent 
      COVID-19-associated hospitalizations included: 85% (95% CI: 82 to 88%) for 2 
      vaccine doses against Alpha; 85% (95% CI: 83 to 87%) for 2 doses against Delta; 
      94% (95% CI: 92 to 95%) for 3 doses against Delta; 65% (95% CI: 51 to 75%) for 2 
      doses against Omicron; and 86% (95% CI: 77 to 91%) for 3 doses against Omicron. 
      Among hospitalized unvaccinated COVID-19 patients, severity on the WHO Clinical 
      Progression Scale was higher for Delta than Alpha (adjusted proportional odds 
      ratio [aPOR] 1.28, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.46), and lower for Omicron than Delta (aPOR 
      0.61, 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.77). Compared to unvaccinated cases, severity was lower 
      for vaccinated cases for each variant, including Alpha (aPOR 0.33, 95% CI: 0.23 
      to 0.49), Delta (aPOR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.51), and Omicron (aPOR 0.61, 95% 
      CI: 0.44 to 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: mRNA vaccines were highly effective in preventing 
      COVID-19-associated hospitalizations from Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants, but 
      three vaccine doses were required to achieve protection against Omicron similar 
      to the protection that two doses provided against Delta and Alpha. Among adults 
      hospitalized with COVID-19, Omicron caused less severe disease than Delta, but 
      still resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality. Vaccinated patients 
      hospitalized with COVID-19 had significantly lower disease severity than 
      unvaccinated patients for all the variants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: People with cancer are at increased risk of hospitalisation and death 
      following infection with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we aimed to conduct one of the 
      first evaluations of vaccine effectiveness against breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 
      infections in patients with cancer at a population level. METHODS: In this 
      population-based test-negative case-control study of the UK Coronavirus Cancer 
      Evaluation Project (UKCCEP), we extracted data from the UKCCEP registry on all 
      SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results (from the Second Generation Surveillance System), 
      vaccination records (from the National Immunisation Management Service), patient 
      demographics, and cancer records from England, UK, from Dec 8, 2020, to Oct 15, 
      2021. Adults (aged ≥18 years) with cancer in the UKCCEP registry were identified 
      via Public Health England's Rapid Cancer Registration Dataset between Jan 1, 
      2018, and April 30, 2021, and comprised the cancer cohort. We constructed a 
      control population cohort from adults with PCR tests in the UKCCEP registry who 
      were not contained within the Rapid Cancer Registration Dataset. The coprimary 
      endpoints were overall vaccine effectiveness against breakthrough infections 
      after the second dose (positive PCR COVID-19 test) and vaccine effectiveness 
      against breakthrough infections at 3-6 months after the second dose in the cancer 
      cohort and control population. FINDINGS: The cancer cohort comprised 377 194 
      individuals, of whom 42 882 had breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections. The control 
      population consisted of 28 010 955 individuals, of whom 5 748 708 had SARS-CoV-2 
      breakthrough infections. Overall vaccine effectiveness was 69·8% (95% CI 
      69·8-69·9) in the control population and 65·5% (65·1-65·9) in the cancer cohort. 
      Vaccine effectiveness at 3-6 months was lower in the cancer cohort (47·0%, 
      46·3-47·6) than in the control population (61·4%, 61·4-61·5). INTERPRETATION: 
      COVID-19 vaccination is effective for individuals with cancer, conferring varying 
      levels of protection against breakthrough infections. However, vaccine 
      effectiveness is lower in patients with cancer than in the general population. 
      COVID-19 vaccination for patients with cancer should be used in conjunction with 
      non-pharmacological strategies and community-based antiviral treatment programmes 
      to reduce the risk that COVID-19 poses to patients with cancer. FUNDING:

TI  - COVID-19: Third dose booster vaccine effectiveness against breakthrough 
      coronavirus infection, hospitalisations and death in patients with cancer: A 
      population-based study.

AB  - PURPOSE: People living with cancer and haematological malignancies are at an 
      increased risk of hospitalisation and death following infection with acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Coronavirus third dose vaccine boosters are 
      proposed to boost waning immune responses in immunocompromised individuals and 
      increase coronavirus protection; however, their effectiveness has not yet been 
      systematically evaluated. METHODS: This study is a population-scale real-world 
      evaluation of the United Kingdom's third dose vaccine booster programme for 
      cancer patients from 8th December 2020 to 7th December 2021. The cancer cohort 
      comprises individuals from Public Health England's national cancer dataset, 
      excluding individuals less than 18 years. A test-negative case-control design was 
      used to assess the third dose booster vaccine effectiveness. Multivariable 
      logistic regression models were fitted to compare risk in the cancer cohort 
      relative to the general population. RESULTS: The cancer cohort comprised of 
      2,258,553 tests from 361,098 individuals. Third dose boosters were evaluated by 
      reference to 87,039,743 polymerase chain reaction coronavirus tests. Vaccine 
      effectiveness against breakthrough infections, symptomatic infections, 
      coronavirus hospitalisation and death in cancer patients were 59.1%, 62.8%, 80.5% 
      and 94.5%, respectively. Lower vaccine effectiveness was associated with a cancer 
      diagnosis within 12 months, lymphoma, recent systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) 
      or radiotherapy. Patients with lymphoma had low levels of protection from 
      symptomatic disease. In spite of third dose boosters, following multivariable 
      adjustment, individuals with cancer remain at an increased risk of coronavirus 
      hospitalisation and death compared to the population control (OR 3.38, 3.01, 
      respectively. p &lt; 0.001 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Third dose boosters are 
      effective for most individuals with cancer, increasing protection from 
      coronavirus. However, their effectiveness is heterogenous and lower than the 
      general population. Many patients with cancer will remain at the increased risk 
      of coronavirus infections even after 3 doses. In the case of patients with 
      lymphoma, there is a particularly strong disparity of vaccine effectiveness 
      against breakthrough infection and severe disease. Breakthrough infections will 
      disrupt cancer care and treatment with potentially adverse consequences on 
      survival outcomes. The data support the role of vaccine boosters in preventing 
      severe disease, and further pharmacological intervention to prevent transmission 
      and aid viral clearance to limit the disruption of cancer care as the delivery of 
      care continues to evolve during the coronavirus pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and 
      Surveillance Centre (RSC) is one of Europe's oldest sentinel systems, working 
      with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and its predecessor bodies for 55 
      years. Its surveillance report now runs twice weekly, supplemented by online 
      observatories. In addition to conducting sentinel surveillance from a nationally 
      representative group of practices, the RSC is now also providing data for 
      syndromic surveillance. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the 
      cohort profile at the start of the 2021-2022 surveillance season and recent 
      changes to our surveillance practice. METHODS: The RSC's pseudonymized primary 
      care data, linked to hospital and other data, are held in the Oxford-RCGP 
      Clinical Informatics Digital Hub, a Trusted Research Environment. We describe the 
      RSC's cohort profile as of September 2021, divided into a Primary Care Sentinel 
      Cohort (PCSC)-collecting virological and serological specimens-and a larger group 
      of syndromic surveillance general practices (SSGPs). We report changes to our 
      sampling strategy that brings the RSC into alignment with European Centre for 
      Disease Control guidance and then compare our cohort's sociodemographic 
      characteristics with Office for National Statistics data. We further describe 
      influenza and COVID-19 vaccine coverage for the 2020-2021 season (week 40 of 2020 
      to week 39 of 2021), with the latter differentiated by vaccine brand. Finally, we 
      report COVID-19-related outcomes in terms of hospitalization, intensive care unit 
      (ICU) admission, and death. RESULTS: As a response to COVID-19, the RSC grew from 
      just over 500 PCSC practices in 2019 to 1879 practices in 2021 (PCSC, n=938; 
      SSGP, n=1203). This represents 28.6% of English general practices and 30.59% 
      (17,299,780/56,550,136) of the population. In the reporting period, the PCSC 
      collected >8000 virology and >23,000 serology samples. The RSC population was 
      broadly representative of the national population in terms of age, gender, 
      ethnicity, National Health Service Region, socioeconomic status, obesity, and 
      smoking habit. The RSC captured vaccine coverage data for influenza (n=5.4 
      million) and COVID-19, reporting dose one (n=11.9 million), two (n=11 million), 
      and three (n=0.4 million) for the latter as well as brand-specific uptake data 
      (AstraZeneca vaccine, n=11.6 million; Pfizer, n=10.8 million; and Moderna, n=0.7 
      million). The median (IQR) number of COVID-19 hospitalizations and ICU admissions 
      was 1181 (559-1559) and 115 (50-174) per week, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The RSC 
      is broadly representative of the national population; its PCSC is geographically 
      representative and its SSGPs are newly supporting UKHSA syndromic surveillance 
      efforts. The network captures vaccine coverage and has expanded from reporting 
      primary care attendances to providing data on onward hospital outcomes and 
      deaths. The challenge remains to increase virological and serological sampling to 
      monitor the effectiveness and waning of all vaccines available in a timely 
      manner.

AB  - PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a constant health threat 
      since its emergence. Amongst risk factors proposed, a diagnosis of cancer has 
      been worrisome. We report the impact of cancer and other risk factors in US 
      Veterans receiving care at Veterans Administration (VA) Hospitals, their adjusted 
      odds ratio (aOR) for infection and death, and report on the impact of vaccines on 
      the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infections in Veterans without/with 
      cancer. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of US Veterans without/with cancer 
      by mining VA COVID-19 Shared Data Resource (CSDR) data using the VA Informatics 
      and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI). Our observation period includes index dates 
      from 14DEC2020 to 25JAN2022, encompassing both the delta and omicron waves in the 
      US. RESULTS: We identified 915,928 Veterans, 24% of whom were African Americans 
      who had undergone COVID testing-688,541 were and 227,387 were not vaccinated. 
      157,072 had a cancer diagnosis in the preceding two years. Age emerged as the 
      major risk factor, with gender, BMI, and (Elixhauser) comorbidity contributing 
      less. Among veterans with solid tumors other than lung cancer, risks of infection 
      and death within 60 days were comparable to Veterans without cancer. However, 
      those with hematologic malignancies fared worse. Vaccination was highly effective 
      across all cancer cohorts; the respective rates of infection and death after 
      infection were 8% and 5% among the vaccinated compared to 47% and 10% in the 
      unvaccinated. Amongst vaccinated, increased risk of infection was noted in both, 
      Veterans with hematologic malignancy treated with chemotherapy (HR, 2.993, P < 
      0.0001) or targeted therapies (HR, 1.781, P < 0.0001), and in solid tumors 
      treated with either chemotherapy (HR 2.328, 95%CI 2.075-2.611, P < 0.0001) or 
      targeted therapies (HR 1.328, P < 0.0001) when compared to those not on 
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Risk for COVID-19 infection and death from infection vary 
      based on cancer type and therapies administered. Importantly and encouragingly, 
      the duration of protection from infection following vaccination in Veterans with 
      a diagnosis of cancer was remarkably like those without a cancer diagnosis. 
      Veterans with hematologic malignancies are especially vulnerable, with lower 
      vaccine effectiveness (VE).

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Studies have shown decreased response to coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) vaccinations in some populations. In addition, it is possible 
      that vaccine-triggered immune activation could trigger immune dysregulation and 
      thus exacerbate inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In this population-based study 
      we used the epi-Israeli IBD Research Nucleus validated cohort to explore the 
      effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in IBD and to assess its effect on disease 
      outcomes. METHODS: We included all IBD patients insured in 2 of the 4 Israeli 
      health maintenance organizations, covering 35% of the population. Patients 
      receiving 2 Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine doses between December 2020 and June 
      2021 were individually matched to non-IBD controls. To assess IBD outcomes, we 
      matched vaccinated to unvaccinated IBD patients, and response was analyzed per 
      medical treatment. RESULTS: In total, 12,109 IBD patients received 2 vaccine 
      doses, of whom 4946 were matched to non-IBD controls (mean age, 51 ± 16 years; 
      median follow-up, 22 weeks; interquartile range, 4-24). Fifteen patients in each 
      group (0.3%) developed COVID-19 after vaccination (odds ratio, 1; 95% confidence 
      interval, 0.49-2.05; P = 1.0). Patients on tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors 
      and/or corticosteroids did not have a higher incidence of infection. To explore 
      IBD outcomes, 707 vaccinated IBD patients were compared with unvaccinated IBD 
      patients by stringent matching (median follow-up, 14 weeks; interquartile range, 
      2.3-20.4). The risk of exacerbation was 29% in the vaccinated patients compared 
      with 26% in unvaccinated patients (P = .3). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine 
      effectiveness in IBD patients is comparable with that in non-IBD controls and is 
      not influenced by treatment with TNF inhibitors or corticosteroids. The IBD 
      exacerbation rate did not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients.

TI  - Effectiveness of the Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson & Johnson) Coronavirus Disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) Vaccine for Preventing COVID-19 Hospitalizations and Progression to 
      High Disease Severity in the United States.

AB  - Background . Adults in the United States (US) began receiving the adenovirus 
      vector coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson & 
      Johnson [Janssen]), in February 2021. We evaluated Ad26.COV2.S vaccine 
      effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 hospitalization and high disease severity 
      during the first 10 months of its use. Methods . In a multicenter case-control 
      analysis of US adults (≥18 years) hospitalized 11 March to 15 December 2021, we 
      estimated VE against susceptibility to COVID-19 hospitalization (VEs), comparing 
      odds of prior vaccination with a single dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine between 
      hospitalized cases with COVID-19 and controls without COVID-19. Among 
      hospitalized patients with COVID-19, we estimated VE against disease progression 
      (VEp) to death or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), comparing odds of prior 
      vaccination between patients with and without progression. Results . After 
      excluding patients receiving mRNA vaccines, among 3979 COVID-19 case-patients (5% 
      vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S) and 2229 controls (13% vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S), 
      VEs of Ad26.COV2.S against COVID-19 hospitalization was 70% (95% confidence 
      interval [CI]: 63-75%) overall, including 55% (29-72%) among immunocompromised 
      patients, and 72% (64-77%) among immunocompetent patients, for whom VEs was 
      similar at 14-90 days (73% [59-82%]), 91-180 days (71% [60-80%]), and 181-274 
      days (70% [54-81%]) postvaccination. Among hospitalized COVID-19 case-patients, 
      VEp was 46% (18-65%) among immunocompetent patients. Conclusions . The 
      Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization by 72% 
      among immunocompetent adults without waning through 6 months postvaccination. 
      After hospitalization for COVID-19, vaccinated immunocompetent patients were less 
      likely to require IMV or die compared to unvaccinated immunocompetent patients.

TI  - Absolute and Relative Vaccine Effectiveness of Primary and Booster Series of 
      COVID-19 Vaccines (mRNA and Adenovirus Vector) Against COVID-19 Hospitalizations 
      in the United States, December 2021-April 2022.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine effectiveness (VE) 
      studies are increasingly reporting relative VE (rVE) comparing a primary series 
      plus booster doses with a primary series only. Interpretation of rVE differs from 
      traditional studies measuring absolute VE (aVE) of a vaccine regimen against an 
      unvaccinated referent group. We estimated aVE and rVE against COVID-19 
      hospitalization in primary-series plus first-booster recipients of COVID-19 
      vaccines. METHODS: Booster-eligible immunocompetent adults hospitalized at 21 
      medical centers in the United States during December 25, 2021-April 4, 2022 were 
      included. In a test-negative design, logistic regression with case status as the 
      outcome and completion of primary vaccine series or primary series plus 1 booster 
      dose as the predictors, adjusted for potential confounders, were used to estimate 
      aVE and rVE. RESULTS: A total of 2060 patients were analyzed, including 1104 
      COVID-19 cases and 956 controls. Relative VE against COVID-19 hospitalization in 
      boosted mRNA vaccine recipients versus primary series only was 66% (95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 55%-74%); aVE was 81% (95% CI, 75%-86%) for boosted 
      versus 46% (95% CI, 30%-58%) for primary. For boosted Janssen vaccine recipients 
      versus primary series, rVE was 49% (95% CI, -9% to 76%); aVE was 62% (95% CI, 
      33%-79%) for boosted versus 36% (95% CI, -4% to 60%) for primary. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Vaccine booster doses increased protection against COVID-19 hospitalization 
      compared with a primary series. Comparing rVE measures across studies can lead to 
      flawed interpretations of the added value of a new vaccination regimen, whereas 
      difference in aVE, when available, may be a more useful metric.

TI  - Effectiveness Associated With Vaccination After COVID-19 Recovery in Preventing 
      Reinfection.
PG  - e2223917
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.23917 [doi]
LID - e2223917
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The benefit of vaccination for preventing reinfection among 
      individuals who have been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 is largely unknown. 
      OBJECTIVE: To obtain population-based estimates of the probability of SARS-CoV-2 
      reinfection and the effectiveness associated with vaccination after recovery from 
      COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used Rhode Island 
      statewide surveillance data from March 1, 2020, to December 9, 2021, on COVID-19 
      vaccinations, laboratory-confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and fatalities to 
      conduct a population-based, retrospective study during periods when wild type, 
      Alpha, and Delta strains of SARS-CoV-2 were predominant. Participants included 
      Rhode Island residents aged 12 years and older who were previously diagnosed with 
      COVID-19 and unvaccinated at the time of first infection, stratified into 3 
      subpopulations: long-term congregate care (LTCC) residents, LTCC employees, and 
      the general population (ie, individuals not associated with congregate settings). 
      Data were analyzed from October 2021 to January 2022. EXPOSURES: Completion of 
      the primary vaccination series, defined as 14 days after the second dose of an 
      mRNA vaccine or 1 dose of vector virus vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The 
      main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, defined as a laboratory-confirmed 
      positive result on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antigen test at least 90 
      days after the first laboratory-confirmed positive result on a PCR or antigen 
      test. RESULTS: Overall, 3124 LTCC residents (median [IQR] age, 81 [71-89]; 1675 
      [53.6%] females), 2877 LTCC employees (median [IQR] age, 41 [30-53]; 2186 [76.0%] 
      females), and 94 516 members of the general population (median [IQR] age, 35 
      [24-52] years; 45 030 [47.6%] females) met eligibility criteria. Probability of 
      reinfection at 9 months for those who remained unvaccinated after recovery from 
      prior COVID-19 was 13.0% (95% CI, 12.0%-14.0%) among LTCC residents, 10.0% (95% 
      CI, 8.8%-11.5%) among LTCC employees, and 1.9% (95% CI, 1.8%-2.0%) among the 
      general population. Completion of the primary vaccination series after infection 
      was associated with 49% (95% CI, 27%-65%) protection among LTCC residents, 47% 
      (95% CI, 19%-65%) protection among LTCC employees, and 62% (95% CI, 56%-68%) 
      protection in the general population against reinfection, adjusting for potential 
      sociodemographic and clinical confounders and temporal variation in infection 
      rates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that risk of SARS-CoV-2 
      reinfection after recovery from COVID-19 was relatively high among individuals 
      who remained unvaccinated. Vaccination after recovery from COVID-19 was 
      associated with reducing risk of reinfection by approximately half.

TI  - Predictors of Serological Response to SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in Kidney Transplant 
      Patients: Baseline Characteristics, Immunosuppression, and the Role of IMPDH 
      Monitoring.
LID - 10.3390/jcm11061697 [doi]
LID - 1697
AB  - Immunosuppression increases the risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19). Morbidity and mortality of this disease in kidney transplant patients 
      are higher than in the general population. As the vaccination response of 
      transplant patients is weak, serological monitoring was performed. In this cohort 
      study, we analyzed the determinants of vaccination response. All patients had no 
      history of COVID-19. With anti-spike IgG monitoring, 148 responders and 415 
      non-responders were identified. We compared both groups using multivariate 
      analyses of the cohort and a sub-cohort of mycophenolic-acid-treated patients. We 
      investigated the influence of patient characteristics, immunosuppression, and 
      erythrocyte inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) activity. In responders, 
      the time after transplantation was longer (13.5 vs. 8.5 years), the glomerular 
      filtration rate was higher (56.9 vs. 47.8 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), and responders were 
      younger (53.0 vs. 57.4 years). Heterologous vaccination was more effective than 
      homologous vaccination. Calcineurin inhibitors plus mycophenolate reduced the 
      seroconversion rate. No seroconversion was observed in belatacept patients. In 
      mycophenolate-treated patients, IMPDH activity was a significantly better 
      predictor of response than mycophenolate dose (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.62, p &lt; 0.001). 
      Immunosuppression strongly affects vaccine response. Modifications to 
      immunosuppression should be considered in order to facilitate this response. 
      Erythrocyte IMPDH activity can be used to guide mycophenolate treatment.

AB  - There is a notable lack of vaccine effectiveness studies using test-negative 
      case-controlled approach in low- and middle-income countries which have different 
      logistic, demographic and socio-economic conditions from high-income countries. 
      We aimed to estimate the effectiveness of BNT162b2 vaccine against COVID-19 
      infection over time, intensive care unit admission, severe or critical disease 
      and death due to COVID-19. This study was conducted in the resident population of 
      Labuan aged ≥18 years who had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 by Reverse-Transcriptase 
      Polymerase Chain Reaction between 1 March 2021 and 31 October 2021. We used a 
      test-negative case-control design where 2644 pairs of cases and controls were 
      matched by age, sex, testing date, nationality and testing reason. Analysis was 
      stratified by age group to estimate age effect (<60 years and ≥60 years). Of 
      22217 individuals tested by Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, 5100 
      were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and aged 18 years and above. Overall vaccine 
      effectiveness ≥ 14 days after the second dose was 65.2% (95% CI: 59.8-69.9%) 
      against COVID-19 infection, 92.5% (95% CI: 72.3-98.8%) against intensive care 
      unit admission, and 96.5% (95% CI: 82.3-99.8%) against COVID-19 deaths. Among 
      infected individuals, vaccine effectiveness was 79.2% (95% CI: 42.3-94.1%) in 
      preventing severe or critical disease due to COVID-19. Vaccine effectiveness for 
      ≥60 years was 72.3% (95% CI: 53.4-83.9%) in fully vaccinated individuals, higher 
      than 64.8% (95% CI: 49.3-59.1%) for those <60 years. Two doses of BNT162b2 were 
      highly effective against COVID-19 infection, severe or critical disease, 
      intensive care unit admission and death due to COVID-19. This study addresses a 
      gap in literature on BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness in low- and middle-income 
      populations and demonstrates the feasibility of such a study design in a resource 
      limited setting while supporting evidence of waning immunity.

TI  - Association between primary or booster COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and Omicron 
      lineage BA.1 SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection: A 
      test-negative case-control analysis.
PG  - e1004136

AB  - BACKGROUND: The benefit of primary and booster vaccination in people who 
      experienced a prior Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      infection remains unclear. The objective of this study was to estimate the 
      effectiveness of primary (two-dose series) and booster (third dose) mRNA 
      vaccination against Omicron (lineage BA.1) infection among people with a prior 
      documented infection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a test-negative 
      case-control study of reverse transcription PCRs (RT-PCRs) analyzed with the 
      TaqPath (Thermo Fisher Scientific) assay and recorded in the Yale New Haven 
      Health system from November 1, 2021, to April 30, 2022. Overall, 11,307 cases 
      (positive TaqPath analyzed RT-PCRs with S-gene target failure [SGTF]) and 130,041 
      controls (negative TaqPath analyzed RT-PCRs) were included (median age: cases: 35 
      years, controls: 39 years). Among cases and controls, 5.9% and 8.1% had a 
      documented prior infection (positive SARS-CoV-2 test record ≥90 days prior to the 
      included test), respectively. We estimated the effectiveness of primary and 
      booster vaccination relative to SGTF-defined Omicron (lineage BA.1) variant 
      infection using a logistic regression adjusted for date of test, age, sex, 
      race/ethnicity, insurance, comorbidities, social venerability index, 
      municipality, and healthcare utilization. The effectiveness of primary 
      vaccination 14 to 149 days after the second dose was 41.0% (95% confidence 
      interval (CI): 14.1% to 59.4%, p 0.006) and 27.1% (95% CI: 18.7% to 34.6%, p < 
      0.001) for people with and without a documented prior infection, respectively. 
      The effectiveness of booster vaccination (≥14 days after booster dose) was 47.1% 
      (95% CI: 22.4% to 63.9%, p 0.001) and 54.1% (95% CI: 49.2% to 58.4%, p < 0.001) 
      in people with and without a documented prior infection, respectively. To test 
      whether booster vaccination reduced the risk of infection beyond that of the 
      primary series, we compared the odds of infection among boosted (≥14 days after 
      booster dose) and booster-eligible people (≥150 days after second dose). The odds 
      ratio (OR) comparing boosted and booster-eligible people with a documented prior 
      infection was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.54 to 1.16, p 0.222), whereas the OR comparing 
      boosted and booster-eligible people without a documented prior infection was 0.54 
      (95% CI: 0.49 to 0.59, p < 0.001). This study's limitations include the risk of 
      residual confounding, the use of data from a single system, and the reliance on 
      TaqPath analyzed RT-PCR results. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that 
      primary vaccination provided significant but limited protection against Omicron 
      (lineage BA.1) infection among people with and without a documented prior 
      infection. While booster vaccination was associated with additional protection 
      against Omicron BA.1 infection in people without a documented prior infection, it 
      was not found to be associated with additional protection among people with a 
      documented prior infection. These findings support primary vaccination in people 
      regardless of documented prior infection status but suggest that infection 
      history may impact the relative benefit of booster doses.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Data about the association of COVID-19 vaccination and prior 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 
      outcomes may guide prevention strategies. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the time-varying 
      association of primary and booster COVID-19 vaccination and prior SARS-CoV-2 
      infection with subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and death. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort study of 10.6 million residents in 
      North Carolina from March 2, 2020, through June 3, 2022. EXPOSURES: COVID-19 
      primary vaccine series and boosters and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOMES 
      AND MEASURES: Rate ratio (RR) of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hazard ratio (HR) of 
      COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. RESULTS: The median age among the 
      10.6 million participants was 39 years; 51.3% were female, 71.5% were White, and 
      9.9% were Hispanic. As of June 3, 2022, 67% of participants had been vaccinated. 
      There were 2 771 364 SARS-CoV-2 infections, with a hospitalization rate of 6.3% 
      and mortality rate of 1.4%. The adjusted RR of the primary vaccine series 
      compared with being unvaccinated against infection became 0.53 (95% CI, 
      0.52-0.53) for BNT162b2, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.51-0.53) for mRNA-1273, and 0.51 (95% 
      CI, 0.50-0.53) for Ad26.COV2.S 10 months after the first dose, but the adjusted 
      HR for hospitalization remained at 0.29 (95% CI, 0.24-0.35) for BNT162b2, 0.27 
      (95% CI, 0.23-0.32) for mRNA-1273, and 0.35 (95% CI, 0.29-0.42) for Ad26.COV2.S 
      and the adjusted HR of death remained at 0.23 (95% CI, 0.17-0.29) for BNT162b2, 
      0.15 (95% CI, 0.11-0.20) for mRNA-1273, and 0.24 (95% CI, 0.19-0.31) for 
      Ad26.COV2.S. For the BNT162b2 primary series, boosting in December 2021 with 
      BNT162b2 had the adjusted RR relative to primary series of 0.39 (95% CI, 
      0.38-0.40) and boosting with mRNA-1273 had the adjusted RR of 0.32 (95% CI, 
      0.30-0.34) against infection after 1 month and boosting with BNT162b2 had the 
      adjusted RR of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.82-0.86) and boosting with mRNA-1273 had the 
      adjusted RR of 0.60 (95% CI, 0.57-0.62) after 3 months. Among all participants, 
      the adjusted RR of Omicron infection compared with no prior infection was 
      estimated at 0.23 (95% CI, 0.22-0.24) against infection, and the adjusted HRs 
      were 0.10 (95% CI, 0.07-0.14) against hospitalization and 0.11 (95% CI, 
      0.08-0.15) against death after 4 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Receipt of 
      primary COVID-19 vaccine series compared with being unvaccinated, receipt of 
      boosters compared with primary vaccination, and prior infection compared with no 
      prior infection were all significantly associated with lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 
      infection (including Omicron) and resulting hospitalization and death. The 
      associated protection waned over time, especially against infection.

      SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) among an Australian population with low prior 
      rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We estimate effectiveness of 3 versus 2 vaccine doses against 
      SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 Omicron in a mostly infection-naiive but highly vaccinated 
      Australian population. METHODS: Cohort study of adults aged 40+ years resident in 
      Sydney followed from 1 January 2022 for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 
      hospitalisation or death using linked immunisation, disease notification and 
      hospitalisation registers. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and corresponding 
      relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) were estimated comparing 3 to 2 vaccine dose 
      recipients by time since dose receipt, vaccine brand, and prior infection. 
      Absolute risk reductions and numbers needed to boost by age groups were 
      calculated. RESULTS: 2,053,123 infection-naiive individuals (mean age 59 years) 
      were followed for 327,272 person-years for infection and 224,269 person-years for 
      severe outcomes (hospitalisation/death). There were 175,849 infections and 4113 
      hospitalisations/deaths. Compared to individuals receiving dose 2 within the last 
      3 months, rVE in dose 3 recipients was 7% (95% CI 5-9%) against infection and 65% 
      (95%CI 61-69%) against hospitalisation/death. Almost all dose 3 recipients had an 
      mRNA vaccine; there was little difference in dose 3 rVE by primary course vaccine 
      brand (ChAdOx1 versus BNT162b2). Over the 6-week follow-up, we estimated one 
      hospitalisation/death was avoided for every 192 adults aged ≥70 years boosted 
      with dose 3 in the infection-naiive cohort. The aHR for hospitalisation/death 
      from Omicron was 0.12 (95 %CI 0.07-0.23) for 2-dose recipients with a prior Delta 
      infection compared with 2-dose recipients with no prior infection. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Receipt of a third COVID-19 vaccine dose in adults aged 40 years and above 
      significantly reduced hospitalisations and deaths from SARS-CoV-2 Omicron 
      infections in a primarily infection-naiive population.

      Factors and Vaccine Effectiveness.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Little is known about COVID vaccine breakthrough infections and their 
      risk factors. OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 
      breakthrough infections among vaccinated individuals and to reassess the 
      effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination against severe outcomes using real-world 
      data. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a series of observational 
      retrospective analyses using the electronic health records (EHRs) of Columbia 
      University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian (CUIMC/NYP) up to 
      September 21, 2021. New York adult residence with PCR test records were included 
      in this analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Poisson regression was used to 
      assess the association between breakthrough infection rate in vaccinated 
      individuals and multiple risk factors - including vaccine brand, demographics, 
      and underlying conditions - while adjusting for calendar month, prior number of 
      visits and observational days. Logistic regression was used to assess the 
      association between vaccine administration and infection rate by comparing a 
      vaccinated cohort to a historically matched cohort in the pre-vaccinated period. 
      Infection incident rate was also compared between vaccinated individuals and 
      longitudinally matched unvaccinated individuals. Cox regression was used to 
      estimate the association of the vaccine and COVID-19 associated severe outcomes 
      by comparing breakthrough cohort and two matched unvaccinated infection cohorts. 
      RESULTS: Individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BNT162b2 (IRR against 
      Moderna/mRNA-1273 [95% CI]: 1.66 [1.17 - 2.35]); were male (1.47 [1.11 - 1.94%]); 
      and had compromised immune systems (1.48 [1.09 - 2.00]) were at the highest risk 
      for breakthrough infections. Vaccinated individuals had a significant lower 
      infection rate among all subgroups. An increased incidence rate was found in both 
      vaccines over the time. Among individuals infected with COVID-19, vaccination 
      significantly reduced the risk of death (adj. HR: 0.20 [0.08 - 0.49]). CONCLUSION 
      AND RELEVANCE: While we found both mRNA vaccines were effective, 
      Moderna/mRNA-1273 had a lower incidence rate of breakthrough infections. Both 
      vaccines had increased incidence rates over the time. Immunocompromised 
      individuals were among the highest risk groups experiencing breakthrough 
      infections. Given the rapidly changing nature of the SARS-CoV-2, continued 
      monitoring and a generalizable analysis pipeline are warranted to inform quick 
      updates on vaccine effectiveness in real time. KEY POINTS: Question: What risk 
      factors contribute to COVID-19 breakthrough infections among mRNA vaccinated 
      individuals? How do clinical outcomes differ between vaccinated but still 
      SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and non-vaccinated, infected 
      individuals?Findings: This retrospective study uses CUIMC/NYP EHR data up to 
      September 21, 2021. Individuals who were vaccinated with Pfizer/BNT162b2, male, 
      and had compromised immune systems had significantly higher incidence rate ratios 
      of breakthrough infections. Comparing demographically matched pre-vaccinated and 
      unvaccinated individuals, vaccinated individuals had a lower incidence rate of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection among all subgroups.Meaning: Leveraging real-world EHR data 
      provides insight on who may optimally benefit from a booster COVID-19 
      vaccination.

AB  - OBJECT: This study attempted to explore the effects of vaccination on disease 
      severity and the factors for viral clearance and hospitalization in 
      omicron-infected patients. METHODS: The clinical manifestations of 3,265 
      Omicron-infected patients (BA.2 lineage variant; the Omicron group) were compared 
      with those of 226 Delta-infected patients (the Delta group). A Multi-class 
      logistic regression model was employed to analyze the impacts of vaccination 
      doses and intervals on disease severity; a logistic regression model to evaluate 
      the risk factors for hospitalization; R 4.1.2 data analysis to investigate the 
      factors for time for nucleic acid negativization (NAN). RESULTS: Compared with 
      the Delta group, the Omicron group reported a fast transmission, mild symptoms, 
      and lower severity incidence, and a significant inverse correlation of 
      vaccination dose with clinical severity (OR: 0.803, 95%CI: 0.742-0.868, p<0.001). 
      Of the 7 or 5 categories of vaccination status, the risk of severity 
      significantly decreased only at ≥21 days after three doses (OR: 0.618, 95% CI: 
      0.475-0.803, p<0.001; OR: 0.627, 95% CI: 0.482-0.815, p<0.001, respectively). The 
      Omicron group also reported underlying illness as an independent factor for 
      hospitalization, sore throat as a protective factor, and much shorter time for 
      NAN [15 (12,19) vs. 16 (12,22), p<0.05]. NAN was associated positively with age, 
      female gender, fever, cough, and disease severity, but negatively with 
      vaccination doses. CONCLUSION: Booster vaccination should be advocated for 
      COVID-19 pandemic-related control and prevention policies and adequate 
      precautions should be taken for patients with underlying conditions.

TI  - Double Negative Control Inference in Test-Negative Design Studies of Vaccine 
      Effectiveness.
LID - arXiv:2203.12509v3
AB  - The test-negative design (TND) has become a standard approach to evaluate vaccine 
      effectiveness against the risk of acquiring infectious diseases in real-world 
      settings, such as Influenza, Rotavirus, Dengue fever, and more recently COVID-19. 
      In a TND study, individuals who experience symptoms and seek care are recruited 
      and tested for the infectious disease which defines cases and controls. Despite 
      TND's potential to reduce unobserved differences in healthcare seeking behavior 
      (HSB) between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects, it remains subject to various 
      potential biases. First, residual confounding may remain due to unobserved HSB, 
      occupation as healthcare worker, or previous infection history. Second, because 
      selection into the TND sample is a common consequence of infection and HSB, 
      collider stratification bias may exist when conditioning the analysis on tested 
      samples, which further induces confounding by latent HSB. In this paper, we 
      present a novel approach to identify and estimate vaccine effectiveness in the 
      target population by carefully leveraging a pair of negative control exposure and 
      outcome variables to account for potential hidden bias in TND studies. We 
      illustrate our proposed method with extensive simulations and an application to 
      study COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness using data from the University of Michigan 
      Health System.

      case series analysis.
PG  - e068373

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the association between covid-19 vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 
      infection, and risk of immune mediated neurological events. DESIGN: Population 
      based historical rate comparison study and self-controlled case series analysis. 
      SETTING: Primary care records from the United Kingdom, and primary care records 
      from Spain linked to hospital data. PARTICIPANTS: 8 330 497 people who received 
      at least one dose of covid-19 vaccines ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or 
      Ad.26.COV2.S between the rollout of the vaccination campaigns and end of data 
      availability (UK: 9 May 2021; Spain: 30 June 2021). The study sample also 
      comprised a cohort of 735 870 unvaccinated individuals with a first positive 
      reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test result for SARS-CoV-2 from 1 
      September 2020, and 14 330 080 participants from the general population. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were incidence of Bell's palsy, encephalomyelitis, 
      Guillain-Barré syndrome, and transverse myelitis. Incidence rates were estimated 
      in the 21 days after the first vaccine dose, 90 days after a positive test result 
      for SARS-CoV-2, and between 2017 and 2019 for background rates in the general 
      population cohort. Indirectly standardised incidence ratios were estimated. 
      Adjusted incidence rate ratios were estimated from the self-controlled case 
      series. RESULTS: The study included 4 376 535 people who received ChAdOx1 
      nCoV-19, 3 588 318 who received BNT162b2, 244 913 who received mRNA-1273, and 
      120 731 who received Ad26.CoV.2; 735 870 people with SARS-CoV-2 infection; and 
      14 330 080 people from the general population. Overall, post-vaccine rates were 
      consistent with expected (background) rates for Bell's palsy, encephalomyelitis, 
      and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Self-controlled case series was conducted only for 
      Bell's palsy, given limited statistical power, but with no safety signal seen for 
      those vaccinated. Rates were, however, higher than expected after SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. For example, in the data from the UK, the standardised incidence ratio 
      for Bell's palsy was 1.33 (1.02 to 1.74), for encephalomyelitis was 6.89 (3.82 to 
      12.44), and for Guillain-Barré syndrome was 3.53 (1.83 to 6.77). Transverse 
      myelitis was rare (<5 events in all vaccinated cohorts) and could not be 
      analysed. CONCLUSIONS: No safety signal was observed between covid-19 vaccines 
      and the immune mediated neurological events of Bell's palsy, encephalomyelitis, 
      Guillain-Barré syndrome, and transverse myelitis. An increased risk of Bell's 
      palsy, encephalomyelitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome was, however, observed for 
      people with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

TI  - Effect of Vaccination Time Intervals on SARS-COV-2 Omicron Variant Strain 
      Infection in Guangzhou: A Real-World Matched Case-Control Study.
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10111855 [doi]
LID - 1855
AB  - In April 2022, a COVID-19 outbreak caused by the Omicron variant emerged in 
      Guangzhou. A case-control study was conducted to explore the relationship between 
      vaccination intervals and SARS-CoV-2 infection in the real world. According to 
      the vaccination dose and age information of the cases, a 1:4 matched case-control 
      sample was established, finally including n = 242 for the case group and n = 968 
      for the control group. The results indicated that among the participants who 
      received three vaccine doses, those with an interval of more than 300 days 
      between the receipt of the first vaccine dose and infection (or the first contact 
      with a confirmed case) were less likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 than those 
      with an interval of less than 300 days (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.46-0.99). After 
      age-stratified analysis, among participants aged 18-40 years who received two 
      doses of vaccine, those who received the second dose more than 30 days after the 
      first dose were less likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 
      0.30-0.96). Our findings suggest that we need to extend the interval between the 
      first dose and the second dose and further explore the optimal interval between 
      the first and second and between the second and third doses in order to improve 
      vaccine efficacy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Measuring vaccine effectiveness (VE) using real-life data is critical 
      to confirm the effectiveness of licensed vaccine, which could strengthen 
      vaccination adherence. METHODS: We measured VE against adult COVID-19 
      hospitalization in five hospitals in France using a test negative design. We 
      compared the odds of vaccinated patients hospitalized with COVID-19 with the odds 
      of vaccinated patients hospitalized for the same symptoms with a negative test. 
      RESULTS: A total of 853 patients (463 cases and 390 controls) were included, with 
      a total of 170 patients vaccinated (104 with one dose, 65 with two doses, and one 
      with three doses). There were four cases of breakthrough infections, all in 
      immunocompromised patients. The VE was 84.0% (CI(0.95)=[72.6; 90.6]) for one dose 
      and 96.2% (CI(0.95)=[86.8; 98.9]) for two doses. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm 
      the high VE of COVID-19 vaccine in France to prevent hospitalizations due to the 
      alpha variant.

      OBJECTIVE: Study objectives include estimating incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      in essential workers by symptom presentation and demographic factors, determining 
      independent effects of occupational and community exposures on incidence of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, establishing molecular and immunologic characteristics of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in essential workers, describing the duration and patterns 
      of rRT-PCR-positivity, and examining post-vaccine immunologic response. METHODS: 
      Eligible participants include Arizona residents aged 18-85 years who work at 
      least 20 hours per week in an occupation involving regular direct contact (within 
      three feet) with others. Recruitment goals are stratified by demographic 
      characteristics (50% aged 40 or older, 50% women, and 50% Hispanic or American 
      Indian), by occupation (40% healthcare personnel, 30% first responders, and 30% 
      other essential workers), and by prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (with up to 50% 
      seropositive at baseline). Information on sociodemographics, health and medical 
      history, vaccination status, exposures to individuals with suspected or confirmed 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, use of personal protective equipment, and perceived risks 
      are collected at enrollment and updated through quarterly surveys. Every week, 
      participants complete active surveillance for COVID-19-like illness (CLI) and 
      self-collect nasal swabs. Additional self-collected nasal swab and saliva 
      specimens are collected in the event of CLI onset. Respiratory specimens are sent 
      to Marshfield Laboratories and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse 
      transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. CLI symptoms and impact 
      on work and productivity are followed through illness resolution. Serum specimens 
      are collected every 3 months and additional sera are collected following incident 
      rRT-PCR positivity and after each COVID-19 vaccine dose. Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 
      infections will be calculated by person-weeks at risk and compared by occupation 
      and demographic characteristics and by seropositivity status and infection and 
      vaccination history. RESULTS: The AZ HEROES study was funded by the Centers for 
      Disease Control and Prevention. Enrollment began July 27, 2020 and as of May 1, 
      2021 a total of 3,165 participants have been enrolled in the study. CONCLUSIONS: 
      AZ HEROES is unique in aiming to recruit a diverse sample of essential workers 
      and prospectively following strata of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative and seropositive 
      adults. Survey results combined with active surveillance data on exposure, CLI, 
      weekly molecular diagnostic testing, and periodic serology will be used to 
      estimate the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
      assess the intensity and durability of immune responses to natural infection and 
      COVID-19 vaccination, and contribute to the evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine 
      effectiveness. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT: DERR1-10.2196/28925.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In a multi-center prospective cohort of essential workers, we 
      assessed knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) by vaccine intention, prior 
      SARS-CoV-2 positivity, and occupation, and their impact on vaccine uptake over 
      time. METHODS: Initiated in July 2020, the HEROES-RECOVER cohort provided 
      socio-demographics and COVID-19 vaccination data. Using two follow-up surveys 
      approximately three months apart, COVID-19 vaccine KAP, intention, and receipt 
      was collected; the first survey categorized participants as reluctant, reachable, 
      or endorser. RESULTS: A total of 4,803 participants were included in the 
      analysis. Most (70%) were vaccine endorsers, 16% were reachable, and 14% were 
      reluctant. By May 2021, 77% had received at least one vaccine dose. KAP responses 
      strongly predicted vaccine uptake, particularly positive attitudes about safety 
      (aOR = 5.46, 95% CI: 1.4-20.8) and effectiveness (aOR = 5.0, 95% CI: 1.3-19.1). 
      Participants' with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were 22% less likely to believe the 
      COVID-19 vaccine was effective compared with uninfected participants (aOR 0.78, 
      95% CI: 0.64-0.96). This was even more pronounced in first responders compared 
      with other occupations, with first responders 42% less likely to believe in 
      COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (aOR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.40-0.84). Between 
      administrations of the two surveys, 25% of reluctant, 56% reachable, and 83% of 
      endorser groups received the COVID-19 vaccine. The reachable group had large 
      increases in positive responses for questions about vaccine safety (10% of 
      vaccinated, 34% of unvaccinated), and vaccine effectiveness (12% of vaccinated, 
      27% of unvaccinated). DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrates attitudes associated 
      with COVID-19 vaccine uptake and a positive shift in attitudes over time. First 
      responders, despite potential high exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and participants with 
      a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were more vaccine reluctant. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Perceptions of the COVID-19 vaccine can shift over time. Targeting messages about 
      the vaccine's safety and effectiveness in reducing SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and 
      illness severity may increase vaccine uptake for reluctant and reachable 
      participants.

TI  - Interim Estimate of Vaccine Effectiveness of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) Vaccine 
      in Preventing SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Adolescents Aged 12-17 Years - Arizona, 
      July-December 2021.
PG  - 1761-1765
LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm705152a2 [doi]
AB  - The BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA COVID-19 vaccine has demonstrated high 
      efficacy in preventing infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) 
      in randomized placebo-controlled Phase III trials in persons aged 12-17 years 
      (referred to as adolescents in this report) (1); however, data on real-word 
      vaccine effectiveness (VE) among adolescents are limited (1-3). As of December 
      2021, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA) for adolescents aged 16-17 years and under FDA emergency use authorization 
      for those aged 12-15 years. In a prospective cohort in Arizona, 243 adolescents 
      aged 12-17 years were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription-polymerase 
      chain reaction (RT-PCR) each week, irrespective of symptoms, and upon onset of 
      COVID-19-like illness during July 25-December 4, 2021; the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 
      (Delta) variant was the predominant strain during this study period. During the 
      study, 190 adolescents contributed fully vaccinated person-time (≥14 days after 
      receiving 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine), 30 contributed partially 
      vaccinated person-time (receipt of 1 dose or receipt of 2 doses but with the 
      second dose completed <14 days earlier), and 66 contributed unvaccinated 
      person-time. Using the Cox proportional-hazards model, the estimated VE of full 
      Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection was 92% (95% 
      CI = 79%-97%), adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, health information, 
      frequency of social contact, mask use, location, and local virus circulation. 
      These findings from a real-world setting indicate that 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech 
      vaccine are highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection among Arizona 
      adolescents. CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccination for all eligible persons in the 
      United States, including persons aged 12-17 years.

AB  - As national coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mass vaccination campaigns are 
      rolled out, monitoring real-world Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) and its durability 
      is essential. We aimed to estimate COVID-19 VE against severe disease and death 
      in the Greek population, for all vaccines currently in use. Nationwide active 
      surveillance and vaccination registry data during January-December 2021 were used 
      to estimate VE via quasi-Poisson regression, adjusted for age and calendar time. 
      Interaction terms were included to assess VE by age group, against the "delta" 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variant and waning of VE over 
      time. Two doses of BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccines offered very 
      high (>90%) VE against both intubation and death across all age groups, similar 
      against both "delta" and previous variants, with one-dose Ad26.COV2.S slightly 
      lower. VE waned over time but remained >80% at 6 months, and three doses 
      increased VE again to near 100%. Vaccination prevented an estimated 19 691 
      COVID-19 deaths (95% confidence interval: 18 890-20 788) over the study period. 
      All approved vaccines offer strong and also durable protection against COVID-19 
      severe disease and death. Every effort should be made to vaccinate the population 
      with at least two doses, to reduce the mortality and morbidity impact of the 
      pandemic.

TI  - COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, 
      COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths, among individuals aged ≥65 years in 
      Portugal: A cohort study based on data-linkage of national registries 
      February-September 2021.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Using data from electronic health registries, this study intended to 
      estimate the COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the population aged 65 years 
      and more, against symptomatic infection, COVID-19-related hospitalizations, and 
      deaths, overall and by time since complete vaccination for the period February to 
      September 2021. METHODS: We established a cohort of individuals aged 65 and more 
      years old, resident in Portugal mainland, using the National Health Service User 
      number to link eight electronic health registries. Outcomes included were 
      symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, COVID-19-related hospitalizations or deaths. 
      The exposures of interest were the mRNA vaccines (Comirnaty or Spikevax) and the 
      viral vector (Vaxzevria) vaccine. Complete schedule VE was estimated as one minus 
      the confounder adjusted hazard ratio, for each outcome, estimated by 
      time-dependent Cox regression with time-dependent vaccine exposure. RESULTS: For 
      the cohort of individuals aged 65-79 years, complete scheme VE against 
      symptomatic infection varied 43 (95%CI: 37-49) (Vaxzevria) and 65 (95%CI: 62-68) 
      (mRNA vaccines). This estimate was slightly lower in the ≥80 years cohort (53, 
      95%CI: 45-60) for mRNA vaccines). VE against COVID-19 hospitalization varied 
      between 89% (95%CI: 52-94) for Vaxzevria and 95% (95%CI: 93-97) for mRNA vaccines 
      for the cohort aged 65-79 years and was 76% (95%CI: 67-83) for mRNA vaccines in 
      the ≥80 years cohort. High VE against COVID-19-related deaths was estimated, for 
      both vaccine types, 95% and 81 (95%CI:76-86) for the 65-79 years and the ≥80 
      years cohort, respectively. We observed a significant waning of VE against 
      symptomatic infection, with VE estimates reaching approximately 34% for both 
      vaccine types and cohorts. Significant waning was observed for the COVID-19 
      hospitalizations in the ≥80 years cohort (decay from 83% (95%CI:68 to 91) 14-41 
      days to 63% (95%CI:37 to 78) 124 days after mRNA second dose). No significant 
      waning effect was observed for COVID-19-related deaths in the period of follow-up 
      of either cohort. CONCLUSIONS: In a population with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 
      complications, we observed higher overall VE estimates against more severe 
      outcomes for both age cohorts when compared to symptomatic infections. 
      Considering the analysis of VE according to time since complete vaccination, the 
      results showed a waning effect for both age cohorts in symptomatic infection and 
      COVID-19 hospitalization for the 80 and more years cohort.

TI  - Quantitative Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Serological Responses Post Three Doses of 
      Immunization and Prior to Breakthrough COVID-19 Infections.
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10101590 [doi]
LID - 1590
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaccine mediated SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses should be carefully 
      evaluated. With regular follow-up in healthy individuals, we aimed to determine 
      SARS-CoV-2 serological responses post three doses of immunization and prior to 
      breakthrough infections in the Canadian population. METHODS: In a prospective 
      cohort study, we enrolled 140 healthy participants post COVID-19 vaccination in 
      Kingston, Ontario, Canada. IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike 
      receptor-binding domain were quantified by immunoassay post three doses of 
      immunization. With COVID-19 rapid antigen test, polymerase chain reaction, and 
      whole genome sequencing, 27 breakthrough infections were identified. RESULTS: 
      Following SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (including BNT162b2, AZD1222, and mRNA-1273), the 
      median serum anti-spike protein antibody level was 143.6 BAU/mL (binding antibody 
      unit, interquartile range 79.0-266.6) post the first dose of immunization, 1046.4 
      BAU/mL (423.9-1738.2) post the second dose, and 1604.7 BAU/mL (700.1-3764.0) post 
      the third dose. Observed differences were significant (p ≤ 0.001). The median 
      antibody level of 1604.7 BAU/mL post third dose is 45.6 times that of the 
      seroconversion level (35.2 BAU/mL). This indicates that most vaccines approved 
      are effective in producing robust antibody responses. In seven breakthrough cases 
      characterized by whole genome sequencing, prior to infection, antibody 
      concentrations of breakthrough cases were at 3249.4 (Delta), 2748.4 (Delta), 
      4893.9 (Omicron), 209.1 (Omicron), and 231.5 (Omicron), 725.7 (Omicron), and 
      2346.6 (Omicron) BAU/mL. Compared with the average antibody concentration of 
      2057.7 BAU/mL (58 times that of the seroconversion concentration) from above 
      seven cases, 37.2% of triple vaccinated, 19.0% of double vaccinated, and 1.5% 
      single dosed individuals have higher SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Most vaccines are effective in producing robust antibody responses when more than 
      one dose is given, and the more doses the higher the serological response. Likely 
      due to the highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 variants, a significant number 
      of participants have SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses lower than the average 
      antibody concentration prior to the known breakthrough infections. Additional 
      vaccination is likely required to ensure immunity against infection by 
      SARS-CoV-2.

      symptomatic infection among health care workers in the setting of omicron variant 
      transmission in New Delhi, India.
PG  - 100023
LID - 10.1016/j.lansea.2022.100023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surge of SARS CoV-2 infections ascribed to omicron variant began in 
      December 2021 in New Delhi. We determined the infection and reinfection density 
      in a cohort of health care workers (HCWs) along with vaccine effectiveness (VE) 
      against symptomatic infection within omicron transmission period (considered from 
      December 01, 2021 to February 25, 2022. METHODS: This is an observational study 
      from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Data were collected 
      telephonically. Person-time at risk was counted from November 30, 2021 till date 
      of infection/ reinfection, or date of interview. Comparison of clinical features 
      and severity was done with previous pandemic periods. VE was estimated using 
      test-negative case-control design [matched pairs (for age and sex)]. Vaccination 
      status was compared and adjusted odds ratios (OR) were computed by conditional 
      logistic regression. VE was estimated as (1-adjusted OR)X100-. FINDINGS: 11474 
      HCWs participated in this study. The mean age was 36⋅2 (±10⋅7) years. Complete 
      vaccination with two doses were reported by 9522 (83%) HCWs [8394 (88%) Covaxin 
      and 1072 Covishield (11%)]. The incidence density of all infections and 
      reinfection during the omicron transmission period was 34⋅8 [95% Confidence 
      Interval (CI): 33⋅5-36⋅2] and 45⋅6 [95% CI: 42⋅9-48⋅5] per 10000 person days 
      respectively. The infection was milder as compared to previous periods. VE was 
      52⋅5% (95% CI: 3⋅9-76⋅5, p = 0⋅036) for those who were tested within 14-60 days 
      of receiving second dose and beyond this period (61-180 days), modest effect was 
      observed. INTERPRETATION: Almost one-fifth of HCWs were infected with SARS CoV-2 
      during omicron transmission period, with predominant mild spectrum of COVID-19 
      disease. Waning effects of vaccine protection were noted with increase in time 
      intervals since vaccination. FUNDING: None.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research on the effectiveness of COVID-19 booster-based vaccine 
      schedule is ongoing and real-world data on vaccine effectiveness (VE) in comorbid 
      patients are limited. We aimed to estimate booster dose VE against SARS-CoV-2 
      infection and COVID-19 severity in the general population and in comorbid 
      patients. METHOD: A retrospective test-negative control study was undertaken in 
      Galicia-Spain (December 2020-November 2021). VE and 95% confidence interval (CI) 
      were estimated using multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: 1,512,415 
      (94.13%) negative and 94,334 (5.87%) positive SARS-CoV-2 test results were 
      included. A booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine is associated with substantially 
      higher protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection than vaccination without a booster 
      [VE(boosted) = 87% (95%CI: 83%; 89%); VE(non-boosted) = 66% (95%CI: 65%; 67%)]. 
      The high VE was observed in all ages, but was more pronounced in subjects older 
      than 65 years. VE against COVID-19 severity was analyzed in a mixed population of 
      boosted and non-boosted individuals and considerable protection was obtained [VE: 
      hospitalization = 72% (95%CI: 68%; 75%); intensive care unit administration = 83% 
      (95%CI: 78%; 88%), in-hospital mortality = 66% (95%CI: 53%; 75%)]. Boosted 
      comorbid patients are more protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection than those who 
      were non-boosted. This was observed in a wide range of major diseases including 
      cancer (81% versus 54%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (84% versus 61%), 
      diabetes (84% versus 65%), hypertension (82% versus 65%) and obesity (91% versus 
      67%), among others. CONCLUSIONS: A booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine increases the 
      protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity in the general 
      population and in comorbid patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess the effectiveness of messenger RNA vaccines against severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) in preventing emergency 
      department (ED) presentations for acute respiratory illness. BASIC PROCEDURES: We 
      conducted a retrospective study assessing adult presentations (age ≥ 18) to the 
      University of Miami Hospital's ED from January 1st through August 25th, 2021, 
      with a SARS-COV-2 PCR test and acute respiratory infection symptoms. Vaccine 
      effectiveness was calculated using a test-negative design. Both univariable and 
      multivariable (adjusted for age, gender, race, insurance status, imputed body 
      mass index [BMI], vaccine type, week of presentation) regression analyses were 
      conducted for the full cohort and subgroups. MAIN FINDINGS: The cohort consisted 
      of 13,203 ED presentations-3134 (23.7%) fully vaccinated and SARS-COV-2 negative, 
      108 (0.8%) fully vaccinated and SARS-COV-2 positive, 8817 (66.8%) unvaccinated 
      and SARS-COV-2 negative, and 1144 (8.7%) unvaccinated and SARS-COV-2 positive. 
      Unadjusted vaccination effectiveness was 73.4% (95% confidence interval: 
      67.5%,78.3%) and, after adjustment, 73.8% (66.2%,79.7%). The Moderna vaccine's 
      effectiveness was numerically higher (unadjusted: 78.2% [68.8%, 84.7%]; adjusted: 
      78.0% [68.1%, 84.9%]) than the Pfizer vaccine's (unadjusted: 70.8% [62.9%, 
      76.9%]; adjusted: 73.9% [66.3%,79.8%]). We found a significant difference in 
      adjusted vaccine effectiveness across categories was BMI (p < 0.001)-BMI <25: 
      66.3% (45.3%,79.2%); BMI 25-29: 71.3% (56.1%, 81.2%); BMI 30-34: 84.5% (71.7%, 
      91.5%); and BMI ≥35: 72.7% (50.5%, 84.9%). PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated 
      excellent real-world effectiveness of mRNA vaccines in preventing ED presentation 
      for SARS-COV-2 in a diverse U.S. COHORT: Notably, vaccine effectiveness improved 
      with increasing BMI (until class 2 obesity).

TI  - Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of COVID-19 Hospitalized Patients: A 
      Comparison between Complete mRNA Vaccination Profile and Natural Immunity.
LID - 10.3390/jpm12020259 [doi]
LID - 259
AB  - Although laboratory data show that antibody responses to COVID-19 immunization 
      give superior neutralization of certain circulating variations to spontaneous 
      infection, few real-world epidemiological studies demonstrate the advantage of 
      vaccination for previously infected individuals. This paper summarizes the 
      outcomes of a case-control study conducted in Romania between March 2020 and 
      October 2021 on patients previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. A case-control 
      study was implemented after identification of 62 breakthrough cases. These cases 
      were matched by age and gender to a 1:1 ratio with a control group of 
      unvaccinated patients with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection status. There were no 
      significant differences in the severity of cases and mortality between the study 
      groups. However, unvaccinated patients had a shorter protection from natural 
      immunity than patients with full vaccination status (58 days versus 89 days). The 
      unvaccinated cases with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection were also statistically more 
      likely to have a longer hospital admission duration (12.4 days versus 9.8 days), 
      and required more non-invasive oxygen supplementation during their stay than 
      breakthrough cases (37.1% versus 19.4%). Individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 
      infection who were not vaccinated are not at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 
      infection or mortality compared to those who were completely vaccinated with the 
      mRNA vaccine Comirnaty(®) Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 and acquired a breakthrough 
      infection within 2-3 months of the previous infection with a Beta or Delta 
      SARS-CoV-2 variant. Although our findings are consistent with natural immunity 
      offering similar short-term protection to a second dose of mRNA vaccine, all 
      eligible individuals should be provided with immunization to lower their risk of 
      infection, even if they have already been infected with SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Effectiveness of two coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines (viral vector 
      and inactivated viral vaccine) against severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 
      2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a cohort of healthcare workers.
PG  - 75-81
LID - 10.1017/ice.2022.50 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated real-world vaccine effectiveness for 
      Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1) and CoronaVac against laboratory-confirmed severe 
      acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among healthcare 
      workers (HCWs). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among HCWs 
      (aged ≥18 years) working in a private healthcare system in Brazil between January 
      1, 2021 and August 3, 2021, to assess vaccine effectiveness. We calculated 
      vaccine effectiveness as 1 - rate ratio (RR), with RR determined by adjusting 
      Poisson models with the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as the outcome and the 
      vaccination status as the main variable. We used the logarithmic link function 
      and simple models adjusting for sex, age, and job types. RESULTS: In total, 
      13,813 HCWs met the inclusion criteria for this analysis. Among them, 6,385 
      (46.2%) received the CoronaVac vaccine, 5,916 (42.8%) received the ChAdOx1 
      vaccine, and 1,512 (11.0%) were not vaccinated. Overall, COVID-19 occurred in 6% 
      of unvaccinated HCWs, 3% of HCWs who received 2 doses of CoronaVac vaccine, and 
      0.7% of HCWs who received 2 doses of ChAdOx1 vaccine (P < .001). In the adjusted 
      analyses, the estimated vaccine effectiveness rates were 51.3% for CoronaVac, and 
      88.1% for ChAdOx1 vaccine. Both vaccines reduced the number of hospitalizations, 
      the length of hospital stay, and the need for mechanical ventilation. In 
      addition, 19 SARS-CoV-2 samples from 19 HCWs were screened for mutations of 
      interest. Of 19 samples, 18 were the γ (gamma) variant. CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      both COVID-19 vaccines (viral vector and inactivated virus) can significantly 
      prevent COVID-19 among HCWs, CoronaVac was much less effective. The COVID-19 
      vaccines were also effective against the dominant γ variant.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccines have proven safe and efficacious in reducing severe 
      illness and death. Cuban protein subunit vaccine Abdala has shown safety, 
      tolerability and efficacy (92·3% [95% CI: 85·7‒95·8]) against SARS-CoV-2 in 
      clinical trials. This study aimed to estimate Abdala's real-world vaccine 
      effectiveness (VE). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study in Havana analyzed 
      Cuban Ministry of Public Health databases (May 12-August 31, 2021) to assess VE 
      in preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19 (primary outcomes). Cox 
      models accounting for time-varying vaccination status and adjusting by 
      demographics were used to estimate hazard ratios. A subgroup analysis by age 
      group and a sensitivity analysis including a subgroup of tested persons (qRT-PCR) 
      were conducted. Daily cases and deaths were modelled accounting for different VE. 
      FINDINGS: The study included 1 355 638 persons (Mean age: 49·5 years [SD: 18·2]; 
      704 932 female [52·0%]; ethnicity data unavailable): 1 324 vaccinated 
      (partially/fully) and 31 433 unvaccinated. Estimated VE against severe illness 
      was 93·3% (95% CI: 92·1-94·3) in partially- vaccinated and 98·2% (95% CI: 
      97·9-98·5) in fully-vaccinated and against death was 94·1% (95% CI: 92·5-95·4) in 
      partially-vaccinated and 98·7% (95% CI: 98·3-99·0) in fully-vaccinated. VE 
      exceeded 92·0% in all age groups. Daily cases and deaths during the study period 
      corresponded to a VE above 90%, as predicted by models. INTERPRETATION: The Cuban 
      Abdala protein subunit vaccine was highly effective in preventing severe illness 
      and death from COVID-19 under real-life conditions. FUNDING: Cuban Ministry of 
      Public Health. Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Centre.

TI  - Effects of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine on COVID-19 infection and hospitalisation 
      amongst older people: matched case control study for England.
PG  - 275
LID - 10.1186/s12916-021-02149-4 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine has been shown to be effective at 
      preventing serious COVID-19 events in clinical trials. There is less evidence on 
      effectiveness in real-world settings, especially for older people. Here, we aimed 
      to estimate vaccine effectiveness in the context of the rapid NHS 
      mass-vaccination programme in England, exploiting age-based vaccination 
      eligibility thresholds to minimise and correct for selection bias. METHODS: We 
      studied 170,226 individuals between the ages of 80 and 83 years from community 
      settings outside care homes who received one dose of BNT162b2 mRNA between the 15 
      and 20 December 2020 and were scheduled a second dose 21 days later. We matched 
      these vaccine recipients to slightly younger (aged 76-79 years) persons not yet 
      eligible to receive the vaccine on gender, area of residence, area deprivation, 
      health status, living arrangements, acute illness, and history of seasonal flu 
      vaccination. We compared their rates of COVID-19 positivity and hospitalisation 
      in the subsequent 45 days. We adjusted for the increasing concentration of 
      COVID-19 positivity in the control population caused by the requirement to have 
      no COVID-19 symptoms prior to vaccination. RESULTS: Emergency hospital admissions 
      were 51.0% (95% confidence interval 19.9 to 69.5%) lower and positive COVID-19 
      tests were 55.2% (40.8 to 66.8%) lower for vaccinated individuals compared to 
      matched controls 21 to 27 days after first vaccination. Emergency admissions were 
      75.6% (52.8 to 87.6%) lower, and positive COVID-19 tests were 70.1% (55.1 to 
      80.1%) lower 35 to 41 days after first vaccination when 79% of participants had 
      received a second dose within 26 days of their first dose. CONCLUSIONS: Receipt 
      of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is effective at reducing COVID-19 hospitalisations 
      and infections. The nationwide vaccination of older adults in England with the 
      BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine reduced the burden of COVID-19.

AB  - To investigate the association of the 2019-2020 influenza vaccine with prognosis 
      of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2A, a large multi-database cohort study was 
      conducted in four Italian regions (i.e., Lazio, Lombardy, Veneto, and Tuscany) 
      and the Reggio Emilia province (Emilia-Romagna). More than 21 million adults were 
      residing in the study area (42% of the population). We included 115,945 COVID-19 
      cases diagnosed during the first wave of the pandemic (February-May, 2020); 34.6% 
      of these had been vaccinated against influenza. Three outcomes were considered: 
      hospitalization, death, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission/death. The 
      adjusted relative risk (RR) of being hospitalized in the vaccinated group when 
      compared with the non-vaccinated group was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.86-0.88). This 
      reduction in risk was not confirmed for death (RR = 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01-1.06), or 
      for the combined outcome of ICU admission or death. In conclusion, our study, 
      conducted on the vast majority of the population during the first wave of the 
      pandemic in Italy, showed a 13% statistically significant reduction in the risk 
      of hospitalization in some geographical areas and in the younger population. No 
      impact of seasonal influenza vaccination on COVID-19 prognosis in terms of death 
      and death or ICU admission was estimated.

TI  - Serological Response to BNT162b2 Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in Patients with 
      Inflammatory Rheumatic Diseases: Results From the RHEUVAX Cohort.
PG  - 901055
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.901055 [doi]
LID - 901055
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In the light of the current COVID-19 epidemic and the availability of 
      effective vaccines, this study aims to identify factors associated with 
      non-response to anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as immunological alteration associated 
      with immune rheumatic diseases (IRD) and immunosuppressive medications may impair 
      the response to vaccination. METHODS: Volunteers in the health profession 
      community with IRD, age, and sex-matched controls (CTRL) who underwent 
      vaccination with two doses of BNT162b2 were recruited for this study. 
      Anti-Trimeric Spike protein antibodies were assayed eight ± one weeks after the 
      second vaccine dose. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were performed 
      to identify factors independently associated with non-response and low antibody 
      titers. RESULTS: Samples were obtained from 237 IRD patients (m/f 73/164, mean 
      age 57, CI 95% [56-59]): 4 autoinflammatory diseases (AI), 62 connective tissue 
      diseases (CTD), 86 rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 71 spondylarthritis (SpA) and 14 
      vasculitis (Vsc). 232 CTRL were recruited (m/f 71/161, mean age 57, CI 95% 
      [56-58]). Globally, IRD had a lower seroconversion rate (88.6% vs 99.6%, CI 95% 
      OR [1.61-5.73], p<0.001) and lower antibody titer compared to controls (median 
      (IQR) 403 (131.5-1012) versus 1160 (702.5-1675), p<0.001). After logistic 
      regression, age, corticosteroid (CCS), Abatacept and Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) 
      use were associated with non-response. Lower antibody titer was associated with 
      the use of MMF, ABA, CCS, Rituximab, tumor necrosis factor inhibitor, JAK 
      inhibitors, and higher age. CONCLUSION: The response to anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines 
      is often impaired in IRD patients under treatment and may pose them at higher 
      risk of severe COVID-19. Specific vaccination protocols are desirable for these 
      patients.

TI  - Comparative COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness Over Time in Veterans.
PG  - ofac311
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofac311 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Comparative effectiveness of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      vaccines across patient subgroups is poorly understood and essential to precisely 
      targeting vaccination strategies. METHODS: We used the US Department of Veterans 
      Affairs COVID-19 Shared Data Resource to identify veterans who utilize VA health 
      care and had no documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      infection before December 11, 2020. Using a test-negative case-control design 
      (TND), we used conditional logistic regression with adjustment for covariates to 
      estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) over time for veterans who received 2 doses 
      of mRNA vaccines or 1 dose of Ad26.Cov2.S. RESULTS: We identified 4.8 million 
      veterans with a mean age of 64 years, of whom 58% had ≥1 chronic disease. Vaccine 
      effectiveness for symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and ICU admission or 
      death declined over time and varied by the type of vaccine (P < 0.01). VE 
      estimates against symptomatic infection during months 1 and 7 for mRNA-1273 
      compared with BNT162b2 were 89.7% (95% CI, 84.4%-93.0%) and 57.3% (95% CI, 
      48.4%-64.7%) vs 81.6% (95% CI, 75.9%-85.9%) and 22.5% (95% CI, 7.2%-35.2%) for 
      individuals age <65 years and 78.4% (95% CI, 71.1%-83.9%) and 36.2% (95% CI, 
      27.7%-43.6%) vs 66.3% (95% CI, 55.7%-74.4%) and -23.3% (95% CI, -40.5% to -8.2%) 
      in subjects age ≥65 years; against hospitalization 92.0% (95% CI, 76.1%-97.3%) 
      and 83.1% (95% CI, 66.8%-91.4%) vs 85.6% (95% CI, 72.6%-92.4%) and 57.0% (95% CI, 
      31.2%-73.2%) in subjects age <65 years and 66.1% (95% CI, 45.3%-79.0%) and 64.7% 
      (95% CI, 55.2%-72.3%) vs 61.0% (95% CI, 41.3%-74.2%) and 1.7% (95% CI, -22.0% to 
      20.8%) in those age ≥65 years; against ICU admission or death 89.2% (95% CI, 
      49.5%-97.7%) and 84.4% (95% CI, 59.0%-94.1%) vs 87.6% (95% CI, 61.0%-96.1%) and 
      66.4% (95% CI, 7.7%-87.8%) in subjects age <65 years and 75.4% (95% CI, 
      51.7%-87.5%) and 73.8 (95% CI, 62.9%-81.5%) vs 67.4% (95% CI, 32.6%-84.3%) and 
      29.3% (95% CI, 2.3%-48.9%) in subjects age ≥65 years, respectively (P 
      (interaction) < .01 for all comparisons). Similarly, mRNA-1273 was more effective 
      than BNT162b2 in veterans with >1 chronic disease. CONCLUSIONS: mRNA-1273 was 
      more effective than BNT162b2 in older veterans and those with chronic diseases.

TI  - COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization due to SARS-CoV-2: A 
      test-negative design study based on Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) 
      sentinel surveillance in Spain.
PG  - 1014-1025
LID - 10.1111/irv.13026 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, influenza surveillance systems in 
      Spain were transformed into a new syndromic sentinel surveillance system. The 
      Acute Respiratory Infection Surveillance System (SiVIRA in Spanish) is based on a 
      sentinel network for acute respiratory infection (ARI) surveillance in primary 
      care and a network of sentinel hospitals for severe ARI (SARI) surveillance in 
      hospitals. METHODS: Using a test-negative design and data from SARI admissions 
      notified to SiVIRA between January 1 and October 3, 2021, we estimated COVID-19 
      vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization, by age group, vaccine type, 
      time since vaccination, and SARS-CoV-2 variant. RESULTS: VE was 89% (95% CI: 
      83-93) against COVID-19 hospitalization overall in persons aged 20 years and 
      older. VE was higher for mRNA vaccines, and lower for those aged 80 years and 
      older, with a decrease in protection beyond 3 months of completing vaccination, 
      and a further decrease after 5 months. We found no differences between periods 
      with circulation of Alpha or Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants, although variant-specific 
      VE was slightly higher against Alpha. CONCLUSIONS: The SiVIRA sentinel hospital 
      surveillance network in Spain was able to describe clinical and epidemiological 
      characteristics of SARI hospitalizations and provide estimates of COVID-19 VE in 
      the population under surveillance. Our estimates add to evidence of high 
      effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against severe COVID-19 and waning of protection 
      with time since vaccination in those aged 80 or older. No substantial differences 
      were observed between SARS-CoV-2 variants (Alpha vs. Delta).

AB  - IMPORTANCE: A SARS-CoV-2 vaccine booster dose has been recommended for all 
      nursing home residents. However, data on the effectiveness of an mRNA vaccine 
      booster in preventing infection, hospitalization, and death in this vulnerable 
      population are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between receipt of 
      a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine booster and prevention of infection, hospitalization, 
      or death among nursing home residents. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 
      cohort study emulated sequentially nested target trials for vaccination using 
      data from 2 large multistate US nursing home systems: Genesis HealthCare, a 
      community nursing home operator (system 1) and Veterans Health Administration 
      community living centers (VHA CLCs; system 2). The cohort included long-term 
      (≥100 days) nursing home residents (10 949 residents from 202 community nursing 
      homes and 4321 residents from 128 VHA CLCs) who completed a 2-dose series of an 
      mRNA vaccine (either BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] or mRNA-1273 [Moderna]) and were 
      eligible for a booster dose between September 22 and November 30, 2021. Residents 
      were followed up until March 8, 2022. EXPOSURES: Receipt of a third mRNA vaccine 
      dose, defined as a booster dose (boosted group), or nonreceipt of a booster dose 
      (unboosted group) on an eligible target trial date. If participants in the 
      unboosted group received a booster dose on a later target trial date, they were 
      included in the booster group for that target trial; thus, participants could be 
      included in both the boosted and unboosted groups. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Test-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, or death was followed up to 
      12 weeks after booster vaccination. The primary measure of estimated vaccine 
      effectiveness was the ratio of cumulative incidences in the boosted group vs the 
      unboosted group at week 12, adjusted with inverse probability weights for 
      treatment and censoring. RESULTS: System 1 included 202 community nursing homes; 
      among 8332 boosted residents (5325 [63.9%] female; 6685 [80.2%] White) vs 10 886 
      unboosted residents (6865 [63.1%] female; 8651 [79.5%] White), the median age was 
      78 (IQR, 68-87) years vs 78 (IQR, 68-86) years. System 2 included 128 VHA CLCs; 
      among 3289 boosted residents (3157 [96.0%] male; 1950 [59.3%] White) vs 4317 
      unboosted residents (4151 [96.2%] male; 2434 [56.4%] White), the median age was 
      74 (IQR, 70-80) vs 74 (IQR, 69-80) years. Booster vaccination was associated with 
      reductions in SARS-CoV-2 infections of 37.7% (95% CI, 25.4%-44.2%) in system 1 
      and 57.7% (95% CI, 43.5%-67.8%) in system 2. For hospitalization, reductions of 
      74.4% (95% CI, 44.6%-86.2%) in system 1 and 64.1% (95% CI, 41.3%-76.0%) in system 
      2 were observed. Estimated vaccine effectiveness for death associated with 
      SARS-CoV-2 was 87.9% (95% CI, 75.9%-93.9%) in system 1; however, although a 
      reduction in death was observed in system 2 (46.6%; 95% CI, -34.6% to 94.8%), 
      this reduction was not statistically significant. A total of 45 
      SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths occurred in system 1 and 18 deaths occurred in 
      system 2. For the combined end point of SARS-CoV-2-associated hospitalization or 
      death, boosted residents in system 1 had an 80.3% (95% CI, 65.7%-88.5%) 
      reduction, and boosted residents in system 2 had a 63.8% (95% CI, 41.4%-76.1%) 
      reduction. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, during a period in which 
      both the Delta and Omicron variants were circulating, SARS-CoV-2 booster 
      vaccination was associated with significant reductions in SARS-CoV-2 infections, 
      hospitalizations, and the combined end point of hospitalization or death among 
      residents of 2 US nursing home systems. These findings suggest that 
      administration of vaccine boosters to nursing home residents may have an 
      important role in preventing COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Reduced COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) has been observed with increasing 
      predominance of SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) variant. Two-dose VE against 
      laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (symptomatic and asymptomatic) was 
      estimated using Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying vaccination 
      status in a prospective rural community cohort of 1266 participants 
      aged ≥12 years. Between November 3, 2020 and December 7, 2021, VE was 56% for 
      mRNA COVID-19 vaccines overall, 65% for Moderna, and 50% for Pfizer-BioNTech. VE 
      when Delta predominated (June to December 2021) was 54% for mRNA COVID-19 
      vaccines overall, 59% for Moderna, and 52% for Pfizer-BioNTech.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 mRNA vaccines 
      elicit lower humoral responses in solid-organ transplant recipients. This is the 
      first prospective trial investigating the effect of an inactivated whole-virion 
      vaccine in kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: Prospective, single-center, 
      phase 4, interventional study. Kidney transplant recipients aged 30-69 y with >30 
      d of transplantation received two 3 µg intramuscular doses of CoronaVac 28 d 
      apart and are being followed for 6 mo. Primary outcomes: (1) reactogenicity after 
      first dose; (2) antibody responses 28 d after each dose; and (3) 
      incidence/severity of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 28-d 
      lethality rate. For this analysis, clinical effectiveness was assessed for 3 mo, 
      starting 15 d after the second dose, and compared with 3-mo period before 
      vaccination. RESULTS: Of the 3371 individuals who received the first dose, 99% 
      completed vaccination schedule. Mild/local adverse reactions were reported by 33% 
      of the patients. In the immunogenicity cohort (n = 942), the proportion of 
      patients with IgG antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      increased from 15.2% after first dose to 43% after second dose. Increase in 
      antibody values after second dose was associated with higher proportion of 
      patients with detected neutralizing antibodies. A significant reduction in the 
      incidence of COVID-19 was observed (6.4% versus 4.2%; P < 0.0001), although the 
      28-d lethality rate remained unchanged (25% versus 22%; P = 0.534). In 45 
      patients from the immunogenicity cohort who developed COVID-19, all the 6 deaths 
      occurred among those without antibody response (n = 22; 49%). CONCLUSIONS: 
      CoronaVac vaccine was associated with low reactogenicity, low immunogenicity but 
      reduced incidence of COVID-19 among kidney transplant recipients. The lack of 
      reduction in lethality rates is perhaps associated with the low percentage of 
      patients developing humoral response after the second dose.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of booster vaccinations on the risk of 
      hospitalization with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and how it varies by 
      enrollee characteristics and interval from the initial vaccination to receipt of 
      a booster. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cohort study used 100% Medicare claims from 
      January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2021, and matched 3,940,475 individuals who 
      received boosters to 3,940,475 controls based on week and type of original 
      COVID-19 vaccine and demographic and clinical characteristics. We compared the 
      association of booster vs no booster with COVID-19 hospitalization using Cox 
      proportional hazards regression models controlling for patient characteristics. 
      We also determined the association of time from original vaccine to booster with 
      COVID-19 hospitalization. RESULTS: Over a maximum of 130 days of follow-up, 
      boosted enrollees had 8.20 (95% CI, 7.81 to 8.60) COVID-19 hospitalizations per 
      million days vs 43.70 (95% CI, 42.79 to 44.64) for controls (81% effectiveness). 
      Effectiveness varied by race, prior hospitalizations, and certain comorbidities, 
      for example, leukemia/lymphoma (53% effectiveness), autoimmune disease (73%), and 
      dementia (73%). Boosters received between 6 and 9 months after original 
      vaccination varied between 81% and 85% effectiveness, while boosters received at 
      5 to 6 months (62%) or less than 5 months (58%) were less effective. CONCLUSION: 
      Boosters are highly effective in the Medicare population. Approximately 69,225 
      hospitalizations would be prevented by boosters in the 15 million individuals 
      aged 65 years or older currently not boosted in a period similar to the September 
      2020 through January 2021 period studied. Boosters provided the greatest benefits 
      if they were received between 6 and 9 months following original vaccinations. 
      However, boosters were associated with substantial decreases in COVID-19 
      hospitalizations in all categories of enrollees.

TI  - Knowledge, Attitude, Practices, and Vaccine Hesitancy Among the Latinx Community 
      in Southern California Early in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Survey.
PG  - e38351
LID - 10.2196/38351 [doi]
LID - e38351
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Latinx population in the United States has experienced high rates 
      of infection, hospitalization, and death since the beginning of the COVID-19 
      pandemic. There is little data on the knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) 
      specifically in Latinx communities in the United States. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to 
      assess COVID-19 KAP and vaccine hesitancy among a Latinx cohort in the early 
      stages of the COVID-19 pandemic (from July 2020 to October 2020), at a unique 
      time when a vaccine was not available. METHODS: Participants aged ≥18 years were 
      recruited at a primary care clinic in Southern California and asked to 
      self-report sociodemographic characteristics, KAP, and vaccine hesitancy. A 
      subset of the participants answered the vaccine hesitancy assessment as it was 
      added after the start of data collection. KAP items were summed to create 
      composite scores, with higher scores reflecting increased COVID-19 knowledge, 
      positive attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic, and disease prevention 
      practices. Bivariate and multivariable regression models were fitted to test 
      associations between sociodemographic characteristics and KAP scores. For our 
      analysis, we only included patients who self-identified as Latinx. RESULTS: Our 
      final data set included 265 participants. The participants had a mean age of 49 
      (IQR 38.5-59) years, and 72.1% (n=191) were female, 77% (n=204) had at most a 
      high school degree, 34.7% (n=92) had an annual income <US $25,000, and 11.7% 
      (n=31) had previously tested positive for COVID-19. We found high knowledge 
      regarding transmission and spread; moderate knowledge regarding symptoms 
      awareness; overall negative attitudes, which included high pessimism in 
      government public health efforts and high amounts of fear, anxiety, and 
      frustration due to COVID-19 pandemic; and moderate participation in preventive 
      practices. A college education was positively associated with a higher knowledge 
      score than those without a college education (β=0.14, 95% CI 0.01-1.60; P=.04) 
      when adjusted for covariates. Male gender had a positive association with 
      COVID-19 attitude scores compared to female gender (β=1.61, 95% CI 0.50-2.72; 
      P=.05), and male gender was negatively associated with the COVID-19 practices 
      score compared to female gender (β=-0.16, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.06; P=.03), when 
      both were adjusted for covariates. Among a subset of 203 patients, 26.6% (n=54) 
      indicated that if the vaccine was available, they would not take a COVID-19 
      vaccine, and 18.7% (n=38) were unsure. CONCLUSIONS: Good knowledge and 
      preventative practices in the population may have reflected effective public 
      health messaging and the implementation of public health laws during the first 
      wave of the pandemic; however, the overall fear and anxiety may have reflected 
      the negative impact that the pandemic had on vulnerable populations such as the 
      Latinx community. Although our data are a reflection of a previous time in the 
      pandemic, we believe it captures a critical time that can be used to provide 
      unique insights regarding potential avenues to better protect the Latinx 
      communities against future vaccine-resistant COVID-19 strains. INTERNATIONAL

TI  - Effect of Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines against COVID-19 
      morbidity and mortality in real-world settings at countrywide vaccination 
      campaign in Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 7185-7191
LID - 27271 [pii]
LID - 10.26355/eurrev_202111_27271 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vaccinations are highly essential to control infectious diseases and 
      epidemics. Presently, the entire world faces a challenging crisis of "Severe 
      Acute Respiratory Diseases Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as the COVID-19 
      pandemic". The impact of vaccines at national levels to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 
      cases and deaths are unclear, and people have concerns about the effectiveness of 
      vaccines in real-world settings. This study's objective was to examine the effect 
      of the "Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca" vaccines to prevent SARS-CoV-2 
      cases and deaths in Saudi Arabia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective 
      cohort study, we collected data on SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths from the date of 
      the first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Saudi Arabia March 2, 2020, to the date of 
      launching the vaccination campaign on December 14, 2020; and from December 15, 
      2020, to September 8, 2021. We recorded the World Health Organization data and 
      Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia to evaluate the impact of the 
      "Pfizer/BioNTech, (BNT162b2 mRNA) and Oxford/AstraZeneca (AZD1222)" vaccine 
      against SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths before and after the vaccination campaign in 
      Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: Saudi Arabia launched the "Pfizer/BioNTech and 
      Oxford/AstraZeneca" vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV-2 on December 14, 2020. 
      In Saudi Arabia, before the vaccination campaign from March 2, 2020, to December 
      14, 2020, the mean daily SARS-CoV-2 cases were 1235.60, daily deaths were 22.70, 
      that significantly reduced (p=0.0001) compared to the period after the 
      vaccination campaign from December 15, 2020, to September 8, 2021, in which the 
      daily cases fell to 692.08, and daily deaths fell to 9.48 (p=0.0001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In Saudi Arabia, Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccinations 
      significantly reduced the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths after the 
      vaccination compared to the period before the vaccination campaign at country 
      levels. The study findings demonstrate that vaccination and adherence to 
      nonpharmaceutical intervention can better control the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - BNT162b2 vaccination reduced infections and transmission in a COVID-19 outbreak 
      in a nursing home in Germany, 2021.
PG  - e13051
LID - 10.1111/irv.13051 [doi]
LID - e13051
AB  - BACKGROUND: A SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was detected in a nursing home in February 2021 
      after residents and staff had received two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine in January 
      2021. METHODS: Nursing home staff, long-term residents and day-care receivers 
      were included in a retrospective cohort study. We calculated attack rates (AR), 
      secondary AR (SAR) and their 95% binomial confidence interval (CI), and we 
      compared them using Fisher's exact test or chi-squared test, depending on the 
      sample size. We used Poisson regression with robust error estimates to calculate 
      vaccine effectiveness against SARS-COV-2 infections. We selected variables based 
      on directed acyclic graphs. As a proxy for viral load at diagnosis, we compared 
      the mean Ct values at diagnosis using t tests or Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: 
      The adjusted vaccine effectiveness against infection was 56% (95% CI: 15-77%, 
      p = 0.04). Ct values at diagnosis were higher when intervals after receiving the 
      second vaccination were longer (>21 vs. ≤21 days: 4.48 cycles, p = 0.08). The SAR 
      was 67% lower in households of vaccinated (2/9 [22.2%]) than of unvaccinated 
      infected staff (12/18 [66.7%]; p = 0.046). Vaccination rates were lowest among 
      staff with close physical contact to care-receivers (46%). The highest AR in 
      vaccinated staff had those working on wards (14%). CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination 
      reduced the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, viral load and transmission; however, 
      non-pharmaceutical interventions remain essential to reduce transmission of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infections, even for vaccinated individuals. Vaccination coverage of 
      staff ought to increase reduction of infections among themselves, their household 
      members and residents.

TI  - Boosters reduce in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19: An observational 
      cohort analysis.
PG  - 100227
LID - 10.1016/j.lana.2022.100227 [doi]
LID - 100227
AB  - BACKGROUND: Real-world data on the effectiveness of boosters against COVID-19, 
      especially as new variants continue to emerge, is limited. Our objective was to 
      assess demographic, clinical, and outcome variables of patients requiring 
      hospitalization for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection comparing fully vaccinated and 
      boosted (FV&B), fully vaccinated (FV), and unvaccinated (UV) patients. METHODS: 
      This multicenter observational cohort analysis compared demographic, clinical, 
      and outcome variables in FV&B, FV, and UV adults hospitalized for COVID-19. 
      Partially vaccinated (PV) and individuals still hospitalized beyond the 
      designated follow-up date of February 1, 2022 were excluded. The primary endpoint 
      was in-hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints included characteristics and 
      outcomes in subpopulations of intensive care and geriatric (age >65) patients. 
      FINDINGS: Between August 12th, 2021 and January 20th, 2022, 8232 patient 
      encounters had a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 and required inpatient treatment. 
      Of the 8232 encounters requiring hospitalization, 448 (5.8%) were FV&B, 2257 
      (29.2%) were FV, and 5023 (65.0%) were UV; 357 PV and 147 still hospitalized were 
      excluded. The median age of FV&B cohort was 73 (IQR 62, 82) compared to 70 (IQR 
      59, 80) for FV and 59 (IQR 45, 71) for UV (0.001). Most patients were female in 
      both the FB&V and UV groups with 51.1% and 51.8%, respectively, while the FV 
      group had a majority of males (51.3%). The median Elixhauser weighted score was 
      12 (IQR 3, 22) for FV&B, 10 (IQR 2, 20) for FV, and 9 (IQR 0, 17) for UV groups 
      (p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality was 7.1% in the FV&B, 10.3% in the FV group, 
      and 12.8% in the UV group (p < 0.001). The FV&B group had lower in-hospital 
      mortality than both FV and UV groups (p = 0.045 and p = 0.001, respectively). The 
      FV group had lower in-hospital mortality than the UV group (p = 0.004). 
      INTERPRETATION: Fully vaccinated and boosted patients requiring hospital-level 
      care for breakthrough COVID-19 have lower in-hospital mortality than fully 
      vaccinated and unvaccinated patients despite being older and higher risk at 
      baseline. Boosters offer added protection beyond full vaccination in preventing 
      death. As COVID-19 continues to spread, larger expansive trials are needed to 
      further identify risk factors for severe outcomes among the FV&B population. 
      FUNDING: This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in 
      public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

AB  - Mass vaccination has the potential to curb the current COVID-19 pandemic by 
      protecting individuals who have been vaccinated against the disease and possibly 
      lowering the likelihood of transmission to individuals who have not been 
      vaccinated. The high effectiveness of the widely administered BNT162b vaccine 
      from Pfizer-BioNTech in preventing not only the disease but also infection with 
      SARS-CoV-2 suggests a potential for a population-level effect, which is critical 
      for disease eradication. However, this putative effect is difficult to observe, 
      especially in light of highly fluctuating spatiotemporal epidemic dynamics. Here, 
      by analyzing vaccination records and test results collected during the rapid 
      vaccine rollout in a large population from 177 geographically defined 
      communities, we find that the rates of vaccination in each community are 
      associated with a substantial later decline in infections among a cohort of 
      individuals aged under 16 years, who are unvaccinated. On average, for each 
      20 percentage points of individuals who are vaccinated in a given population, the 
      positive test fraction for the unvaccinated population decreased approximately 
      twofold. These results provide observational evidence that vaccination not only 
      protects individuals who have been vaccinated but also provides cross-protection 
      to unvaccinated individuals in the community.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccine effectiveness 
      during the Delta- and Omicron-predominant periods in Japan. METHODS: We conducted 
      a population-based cohort study among individuals aged 16-64 years during two 
      periods: the Delta-predominant period (July 1-December 31, 2021) and the 
      Omicron-predominant period (January 1-March 29, 2022). RESULTS: When comparing 
      individuals who were vaccinated with those who were unvaccinated, the 
      effectiveness of a second dose against symptomatic infection was 89.8% (95% 
      confidence interval [CI]: 80.5-94.7%) during the Delta-predominant period and 
      21.2% (95% CI: 11.0-30.3%) during the Omicron-predominant period. The 
      effectiveness of a third dose against symptomatic infection was 71.8% (95% CI: 
      60.1-80.1%) during the Omicron-predominant period. CONCLUSION: Vaccine 
      effectiveness against symptomatic infection decreased during the 
      Omicron-predominant period but was maintained by a third dose.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaccine effectiveness against the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 Omicron BA.2 sublineage in Japan is unknown. We assessed the 
      effectiveness of a third dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine compared with that of 2 
      doses. METHODS: We performed a population-based cohort study using a municipality 
      database located in the Chubu region of Japan during the Omicron BA.1- and 
      BA.2-predominant periods (January 1-March 31, 2022 and April 1-27, 2022, 
      respectively). We included residents aged ≥16 years who received a second vaccine 
      dose at ≥14 days before the start of each period, regardless of the third dose. 
      We compared the data at 14 days after the second and third dose and at 2-week 
      intervals from 14 days to 10 weeks after the third dose using a Cox regression 
      model. Vaccine effectiveness was defined as (1 - hazard ratio) × 100 (%). 
      RESULTS: In total, 295 705 and 288 184 individuals were included in the BA.1- and 
      BA.2-predominant periods, respectively. The effectiveness of a third dose against 
      infection was 62.4% and 48.1% in the BA.1- and BA.2-predominant periods, 
      respectively. Vaccine effectiveness at 2-3 weeks and ≥10 weeks after the third 
      dose decreased from 63.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 56.4-69.5%) to 52.9% 
      (95% CI, 41.1-62.3%) and from 54.5% (95% CI, 3.0-78.7%) to 40.1% (95% CI, 
      15.1-57.7%) in the BA.1- and BA.2-predominant periods, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 
      A third dose was moderately effective against BA.1 and BA.2 sublineages, but its 
      effectiveness decreased by approximately 10% age points from 2-3 weeks to 
      ≥10 weeks after the third vaccination.

      Registration Data During Vaccination Program.
PG  - ofac177

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are some concerns about the effectiveness of the inactivated 
      and vector-based vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      in real-world settings with the emergence of new mutations, especially variants 
      of concern. Data derived from administrative repositories during mass vaccination 
      campaigns or programs are of interest to study vaccine effectiveness. METHODS: 
      Using 4-repository administrative data linkage, we conducted a historical cohort 
      study on a target population of 1 882 148 inhabitants aged at least 18 years 
      residing in southern Iran. RESULTS: We estimated a 71.9% [95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 70.7%-73.1%], 81.5% [95% CI, 79.5%-83.4%], 67.5% [95% CI, 59.5%-75.6%], and 
      86.4% [95% CI, 84.1%-88.8%] hospital admission reduction for those who received 
      the full vaccination schedule of BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm), ChAdOx1-S/nCoV-19 
      vaccine (AZD1222, Oxford-AstraZeneca), rAd26-rAd5 (Gam-COVID-Vac, Sputnik V), and 
      BIV1-CovIran (COVIran Barekat) vaccines, respectively. A high reduction in 
      mortality (at least 85%) was observed in all age subgroups of the fully immunized 
      population. CONCLUSIONS: The pragmatic implementation of a vaccination plan 
      including all available vaccine options in the Iranian population was associated 
      with a significant reduction in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) detected 
      infections as well as hospital admissions and deaths associated with COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited descriptive data exist regarding the clinical characteristics 
      of hospitalizations due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      Omicron variant based on vaccination status. METHODS: This was a retrospective 
      cohort study of all patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) between 15 January 2022 and 15 February 2022 across 9 hospitals 
      in a large health network. Data were extracted by manual records review. RESULTS: 
      A total of 351 of 452 (77.7%) unvaccinated, 209 of 331 (63.1%) fully vaccinated, 
      and 107 of 163 (65.6%) boosted patients hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis 
      were determined to be admitted specifically due to COVID-19 (P < .001). Most 
      (85%) boosted patients admitted due to COVID-19 were at least 65 years old and/or 
      had severe immunosuppression, compared to 72.2% of fully vaccinated and 60.7% of 
      unvaccinated patients (P < .001). Significantly more unvaccinated patients 
      (34.2%) required >6 L/minute of supplemental oxygen compared to fully vaccinated 
      (24.4%) and boosted (25.2%) patients (P = .027). The age-adjusted vaccine 
      effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization due to COVID-19 was estimated to be 
      81.1% and 94.1% for full vaccination and boosted status, respectively, whereas VE 
      against mortality related to COVID-19 was estimated to be 84.7% and 94.8%, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: During the Omicron BA.1 sublineage wave, unvaccinated 
      patients hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis were more likely than vaccinated 
      patients to be admitted specifically due to COVID-19. Despite being younger with 
      fewer comorbidities, unvaccinated patients required higher levels of care. 
      Vaccination with a booster provides the greatest protection against 
      hospitalization and death from COVID-19.

TI  - Post-vaccination infection rates and modification of COVID-19 symptoms in 
      vaccinated UK school-aged children and adolescents: A prospective longitudinal 
      cohort study.
PG  - 100429
LID - 10.1016/j.lanepe.2022.100429 [doi]
LID - 100429
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to explore the effectiveness of one-dose BNT162b2 
      vaccination upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, its effect on COVID-19 presentation, and 
      post-vaccination symptoms in children and adolescents (CA) in the UK during 
      periods of Delta and Omicron variant predominance. METHODS: In this prospective 
      longitudinal cohort study, we analysed data from 115,775 CA aged 12-17 years, 
      proxy-reported through the Covid Symptom Study (CSS) smartphone application. We 
      calculated post-vaccination infection risk after one dose of BNT162b2, and 
      described the illness profile of CA with post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
      compared to unvaccinated CA, and post-vaccination side-effects. FINDINGS: Between 
      August 5, 2021 and February 14, 2022, 25,971 UK CA aged 12-17 years received one 
      dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. The probability of testing positive for infection 
      diverged soon after vaccination, and was lower in CA with prior SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. Vaccination reduced proxy-reported infection risk (-80·4% (95% CI 
      -0·82 -0·78) and -53·7% (95% CI -0·62 -0·43) at 14-30 days with Delta and Omicron 
      variants respectively, and -61·5% (95% CI -0·74 -0·44) and -63·7% (95% CI -0·68 
      -0.59) after 61-90 days). Vaccinated CA who contracted SARS-CoV-2 during the 
      Delta period had milder disease than unvaccinated CA; during the Omicron period 
      this was only evident in children aged 12-15 years. Overall disease profile was 
      similar in both vaccinated and unvaccinated CA. Post-vaccination local 
      side-effects were common, systemic side-effects were uncommon, and both resolved 
      within few days (3 days in most cases). INTERPRETATION: One dose of BNT162b2 
      vaccine reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for at least 90 days in CA aged 
      12-17 years. Vaccine protection varied for SARS-CoV-2 variant type (lower for 
      Omicron than Delta variant), and was enhanced by pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. Severity of COVID-19 presentation after vaccination was generally 
      milder, although unvaccinated CA also had generally mild disease. Overall, 
      vaccination was well-tolerated. FUNDING: UK Government Department of Health and

AB  - We conducted a registries-based cohort study of long-term care facility residents 
      >65 years of age offered vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 before March 10, 2021, in Spain. Risk for infection in vaccinated 
      and nonvaccinated persons was compared with risk in the same persons in a period 
      before the vaccination campaign, adjusted by daily-varying incidence and 
      reproduction number. We selected 299,209 persons; 99.0% had >1 dose, 92.6% had 2 
      doses, and 99.8% of vaccines were Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2). For vaccinated 
      persons with no previous infection, vaccine effectiveness was 81.8% (95% CI 
      81.0%-82.7%), and 11.6 (95% CI 11.3-11.9) cases were prevented per 10,000 
      vaccinated/day. In those with previous infection, effectiveness was 56.8% (95% CI 
      47.1%-67.7%). In nonvaccinated residents with no previous infection, risk 
      decreased by up to 81.4% (95% CI 73.3%-90.3%). Our results confirm vaccine 
      effectiveness in this population and suggest indirect protection in nonvaccinated 
      persons.

TI  - Effectiveness of mRNA vaccine boosters against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 
      omicron (B.1.1.529) variant in Spain: a nationwide cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of SARS-CoV-2 has increased capacity 
      to elude immunity and cause breakthrough infections. The aim of this study was to 
      estimate the effectiveness of mRNA-based vaccine boosters (third dose) against 
      infection with the omicron variant by age, sex, time since complete vaccination, 
      type of primary vaccine, and type of booster. METHODS: In this nationwide cohort 
      study, we linked data from three nationwide population registries in Spain 
      (Vaccination Registry, Laboratory Results Registry, and National Health System 
      registry) to select community-dwelling individuals aged 40 years or older, who 
      completed their primary vaccine schedule at least 3 months before the start of 
      follow-up, and had not tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 since the start of the 
      pandemic. On each day between Jan 3, and Feb 6, 2022, we matched individuals who 
      received a booster mRNA vaccine and controls of the same sex, age group, postal 
      code, type of vaccine, time since primary vaccination, and number of previous 
      tests. We estimated risk of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection using the 
      Kaplan-Meier method and compared groups using risk ratios (RR) and risk 
      differences. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as one minus RR. FINDINGS: 
      Between Jan 3, and Feb 6, 2022, 3 111 159 matched pairs were included in our 
      study. Overall, the estimated effectiveness from day 7 to 34 after a booster was 
      51·3% (95% CI 50·2-52·4). Estimated effectiveness was 52·5% (51·3-53·7) for an 
      mRNA-1273 booster and 46·2% (43·5-48·7) for a BNT162b2 booster. Effectiveness was 
      58·6% (55·5-61·6) if primary vaccination had been with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 
      (Oxford-AstraZeneca), 55·3% (52·3-58·2) with mRNA-1273 (Moderna), 49·7% 
      (48·3-51·1) with BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), and 48·0% (42·5-53·7) with 
      Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen). Estimated effectiveness was 43·6% (40·0-47·1) when the 
      booster was administered between 151 days and 180 days after complete vaccination 
      and 52·2% (51·0-53·3) if administered more than 180 days after primary scheduled 
      completion. INTERPRETATION: Booster mRNA vaccine-doses were moderately effective 
      in preventing infection with the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 for over a month 
      after administration, which indicates their suitability as a strategy to limit 
      the health effects of COVID-19 in periods of omicron variant domination. 
      Estimated effectiveness was higher for mRNA-1273 compared with BNT162b2 and 
      increased with time between completed primary vaccination and booster. FUNDING: 
      None.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 Infections Among Patients With Liver Disease and Liver Transplantation 
      Who Received COVID-19 Vaccination.
PG  - 889-897

AB  - Many safe and effective severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) vaccinations dramatically reduce risks of coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) complications and deaths. We aimed to describe cases of SARS-CoV-2 
      infection among patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) and liver transplant 
      (LT) recipients with at least one prior COVID-19 vaccine dose. The SECURE-Liver 
      and COVID-Hep international reporting registries were used to identify 
      laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in CLD and LT patients who received a COVID-19 
      vaccination. Of the 342 cases of lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in the era 
      after vaccine licensing, 40 patients (21 with CLD and 19 with LT) had at least 
      one prior COVID-19 vaccination, including 12 who were fully vaccinated (≥2 weeks 
      after second dose). Of the 21 patients with CLD (90% with cirrhosis), 7 (33%) 
      were hospitalized, 1 (5%) was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 0 
      died. In the LT cohort (n = 19), there were 6 hospitalizations (32%), including 3 
      (16%) resulting in mechanical ventilation and 2 (11%) resulting in death. All 
      three cases of severe COVID-19 occurred in patients who had a single vaccine dose 
      within the last 1-2 weeks. In contemporary patients with CLD, rates of 
      symptomatic infection, hospitalization, ICU admission, invasive ventilation, and 
      death were numerically higher in unvaccinated individuals. Conclusion: This case 
      series demonstrates the potential for COVID-19 infections among patients with CLD 
      and LT recipients who had received the COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccination against 
      SARS-CoV-2 appears to result in favorable outcomes as attested by the absence of 
      mechanical ventilation, ICU, or death among fully vaccinated patients.

TI  - How Does Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 Affect Hospitalized Patients with 
      COVID-19?
LID - 10.3390/jcm11133905 [doi]
LID - 3905
AB  - (1) Background: The development of effective COVID-19 vaccines has reduced the 
      impact of COVID-19 on the general population. Our study aims to analyze how 
      vaccination modifies the likelihood of death and length of stay in hospitalized 
      patients with COVID-19; (2) Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 1927 
      hospitalized patients infected with COVID-19 was conducted. Information was 
      gathered on vaccination status, hospitalization episode, and clinical profile of 
      the patients. The effect of vaccination on mortality was analyzed using a 
      multiple logistic regression model, and length of stay was analyzed using linear 
      regression. The performance and fit of the models were evaluated; (3) Results: In 
      hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the risk of dying during admission in 
      vaccinated patients was half that of non-vaccinated (OR: 0.45; CI 95%: 0.25 to 
      0.84). In patients who were discharged due to improvement, the reduction in 
      hospital stay in vaccinated patients was 3.17 days (CI 95%: 5.88 to 0.47); (4) 
      Conclusions: Patients who, despite having been vaccinated, acquire the infection 
      by SARS-CoV-2, have a significant reduction of the risk of death during admission 
      and a reduction of hospital stay compared with unvaccinated patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We assessed vaccine effectiveness (VE) of BNT162b2 mRNA coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) acquisition among healthcare workers (HCWs) of 
      long-term care facilities (LTCFs). METHODS: This prospective study, in the 
      framework of the "Senior Shield" program in Israel, included routine weekly 
      nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing from all LTCF HCWs since July 2020. All 
      residents and 75% of HCWs were immunized between December 2020 and January 2021. 
      The analysis was limited to HCWs adhering to routine testing. Fully vaccinated 
      (14+ days after second dose; n = 6960) and unvaccinated (n = 2202) HCWs were 
      simultaneously followed until SARS-CoV-2 acquisition or end of follow-up, 11 
      April 2021. Hazard ratios (HRs) for vaccination versus no vaccination were 
      calculated (Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusting for 
      sociodemographics and residential-area COVID-19 incidence). VE was calculated as 
      (1- HR) × 100. RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were compared between 
      vaccinated and unvaccinated HCWs. RESULTS: At >14 days post-second dose, 40 
      vaccinated HCWs acquired SARS-CoV-2 (median follow-up, 66 days; cumulative 
      incidence, 0.6%) versus 84 unvaccinated HCWs (median follow-up, 43 days; 
      cumulative incidence, 5.1%) (HR, .11; 95% CI, .07-.17; unadjusted VE, 89%; 95% 
      CI, 83-93%). Adjusted VE >7 and >14 days post-second dose were similar. The 
      median PCR Ct targeting the ORF1ab gene among 20 vaccinated and 40 unvaccinated 
      HCWs was 32.0 versus 26.7, respectively (P value  = .008). CONCLUSIONS: VE 
      following 2 doses of BNT162b2 against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition in LTCF HCWs was 
      high. The lower viral loads among SARS-CoV-2-positive HCWs suggest further 
      reduction in transmission.

TI  - Association of BNT162b2 Vaccine Third Dose Receipt With Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 
      Infection, COVID-19-Related Hospitalization, and Death Among Residents of 
      Long-term Care Facilities, August to October 2021.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: COVID-19 vaccine might be less immunogenic and effective among 
      residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs). OBJECTIVE: To examine the 
      association of BNT162b2 third dose (first booster dose) with overall SARS-CoV-2 
      infection, COVID-19 hospitalizations, and mortality among LTCF residents during a 
      nationwide surge of the Delta variant in Israel. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This observational cohort study conducted nationwide COVID-19 
      surveillance in LTCFs in Israel between August and October 2021. Participants 
      were residents of LTCFs aged 60 years or older. EXPOSURES: Vaccination with the 
      third dose of BNT162b2 vaccine vs receipt of 2 doses at least 5 months earlier, 
      based on self-preference and choice. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The cumulative 
      incidences of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalizations, and COVID-19-related deaths more 
      than 7 days after vaccination with the third dose were compared between the 
      groups using Kaplan-Meier curves. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were obtained 
      using multivariable Cox regression models. RESULTS: Among 18 611 residents 
      included in the analysis, 12 715 (68.3%) were female, 463 (2.5%) were from the 
      Arab population, 16 976 (91.2%) were from the general Jewish population, and 618 
      (3.3%) were from the ultraorthodox Jewish population; the mean (SD) age was 81.1 
      (9.2) years; 16 082 residents received their first booster dose (third dose) and 
      2529 were vaccinated with 2 doses at least 5 months earlier. The median (IQR) 
      follow-up durations were 66 (60-70) days among 3-dose recipients and 56 (53-62) 
      days among 2-dose-only recipients; 107 residents had SARS-CoV-2 infection after 7 
      days following vaccination with the booster dose compared with 185 among the 
      2-dose only group (cumulative incidence: 0.7% vs 7.5%; adjusted HR, 0.11 [95% CI, 
      0.07-0.15]). The respective adjusted HRs were 0.07 (95% CI, 0.03-0.14) and 0.10 
      (95% CI, 0.04-0.24) for the associations of vaccination with the third dose with 
      hospitalization for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and severe illness. Five 
      COVID-19-related deaths occurred among the third dose vaccinees during the 
      follow-up period compared with 22 among the 2-dose-only vaccinees (cumulative 
      rate: 0.04% vs 0.9%; adjusted HR, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.009-0.16]). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: This cohort study found significant inverse associations between 
      vaccination with the third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine with overall SARS-CoV-2 
      infection, COVID-19 hospitalizations, severe disease, and COVID-19-related deaths 
      among LTCF residents during a massive surge caused by the Delta variant in 
      Israel.

TI  - Effectiveness of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Coronavirus Vaccine (Covishield(TM)) in 
      Preventing SARS-CoV2 Infection, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, 2021.

AB  - We estimated the effectiveness of two doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Covishield) 
      vaccine against any COVID-19 infection among individuals ≥45 years in Chennai, 
      Tamil Nadu, India. A community-based cohort study was conducted from May to 
      September 2021 in a selected geographic area in Chennai. The estimated sample 
      size was 10,232. We enrolled 69,435 individuals, of which 21,793 were above 45 
      years. Two-dose coverage of Covishield in the 18+ and 45+ age group was 18% and 
      31%, respectively. Genomic analysis of 74 out of the 90 aliquots collected from 
      the 303 COVID-19-positive individuals in the 45+ age group showed delta variants 
      and their sub-lineages. The vaccine's effectiveness against COVID-19 disease in 
      the ≥45 age group was 61.3% (95% CI: 43.6-73.4) at least 2 weeks after receiving 
      the second dose of Covishield. We demonstrated the effectiveness of two doses of 
      the ChAdOx1 vaccine against the delta variant in the general population of 
      Chennai. We recommend similar future studies considering emerging variants and 
      newer vaccines. Two-dose vaccine coverage could be ensured to protect against 
      COVID-19 infection.

TI  - Effect of vaccination on the case fatality rate for COVID-19 infections 
      2020-2021: multivariate modelling of data from the US Department of Veterans 
      Affairs.
PG  - e064135

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits of vaccination on the case fatality rate 
      (CFR) for COVID-19 infections. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The US 
      Department of Veterans Affairs has 130 medical centres. We created multivariate 
      models from these data-339 772 patients with COVID-19-as of 30 September 2021. 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome for all models was death within 60 days of 
      the diagnosis. Logistic regression was used to derive adjusted ORs for 
      vaccination and infection with Delta versus earlier variants. Models were 
      adjusted for confounding factors, including demographics, comorbidity indices and 
      novel parameters representing prior diagnoses, vital signs/baseline laboratory 
      tests and outpatient treatments. Patients with a Delta infection were divided 
      into eight cohorts based on the time from vaccination to diagnosis. A common 
      model was used to estimate the odds of death associated with vaccination for each 
      cohort relative to that of unvaccinated patients. RESULTS: 9.1% of subjects were 
      vaccinated. 21.5% had the Delta variant. 18 120 patients (5.33%) died within 60 
      days of their diagnoses. The adjusted OR for a Delta infection was 1.87±0.05, 
      which corresponds to a relative risk (RR) of 1.78. The overall adjusted OR for 
      prior vaccination was 0.280±0.011 corresponding to an RR of 0.291. Raw CFR rose 
      steadily after 10-14 weeks. The OR for vaccination remained stable for 10-34 
      weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Our CFR model controls for the severity of confounding 
      factors and priority of vaccination, rather than solely using the presence of 
      comorbidities. Our results confirm that Delta was more lethal than earlier 
      variants and that vaccination is an effective means of preventing death. After 
      adjusting for major selection biases, we found no evidence that the benefits of 
      vaccination on CFR declined over 34 weeks. We suggest that this model can be used 
      to evaluate vaccines designed for emerging variants.

      Infection among Healthcare Workers.
LID - 10.3390/medicina57080746 [doi]
LID - 746
AB  - Background and Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
      BNT162b2 COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) in preventing severe symptomatic 
      laboratory-confirmed infection among healthcare workers in a real-world scenario. 
      Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of a prospective cohort study 
      was conducted. Subjects with onset illness from January to February 2021 were 
      eligible and classified according to the number of vaccine doses received 
      (single-shot, n = 8; two-shot, n = 12; unvaccinated, n = 290). Results: The 
      vaccine effectiveness against severe illness was 100% in the single and two-shot 
      group. The presented results suggest that vaccination reduces the frequency of 
      severe symptomatic COVID-19 in working-age adults. Conclusions: Efforts focusing 
      on maximizing the number of immunized subjects in the study population may reduce 
      associated economic and social burdens.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of newer variants with the immune escape potential 
      raises concerns about breakthroughs and re-infections resulting in future waves 
      of infection. We examined the protective effect of prior COVID-19 disease and 
      vaccination on infection rates among a cohort of healthcare workers (HCW) in 
      South India during the second wave driven mainly by the delta variant. METHODS 
      AND FINDINGS: Symptomatic HCWs were routinely tested by RT-PCR as per 
      institutional policy. Vaccination was offered to all HCWs in late January, and 
      the details were documented. We set up a non-concurrent cohort to document 
      infection rates and estimated protective efficacy of prior infection and 
      vaccination between 16th Apr to 31st May 2021, using a Cox proportional hazards 
      model with time-varying covariates adjusting for daily incidence. Between June 
      2020 and May 2021, 2735 (23.9%) of 11,405 HCWs were infected, with 1412, 
      including 32 re-infections, reported during the second wave. 6863 HCWs received 
      two doses of vaccine and 1905 one dose. The protective efficacy of prior 
      infection against symptomatic infection was 86.0% (95% CI 76.7%-91.6%). 
      Vaccination combined with prior infection provided 91.1% (95% CI 84.1%-94.9%) 
      efficacy. In the absence of prior infection, vaccine efficacy against symptomatic 
      infection during the second wave was 31.8% (95% CI 23.5%- 39.1%). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Prior infection provided substantial protection against symptomatic re-infection 
      and severe disease during a delta variant driven second wave in a cohort of 
      health care workers.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The first case of novel SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) in Pakistan was 
      detected on 26 February 2020. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies 
      have been tried to lessen the mortality and morbidity burden. Various vaccines 
      have been approved. The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan gave emergency 
      approval for Sinopharm (BBIBP-CorV) COVID-19 vaccine in December 2021. The phase 
      3 trial of BBIBP-CorV included only 612 participants aged 60 years and above. The 
      primary aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of BBIBPP-CorV 
      (Sinopharm) vaccine within the Pakistani adult population aged 60 or above. The 
      study was carried out in the Faisalabad district of Pakistan. METHODS: A test 
      negative case-control study design was used to assess safety and efficacy of 
      BBIBP-CorV in individuals aged 60 and above against symptomatic infection, 
      hospitalisations and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 among vaccinated and 
      unvaccinated individuals. ORs were calculated using logistic regression model at 
      95% CI. ORs were used to calculate the vaccine efficacy (VE) by using the 
      following formula.VE= (1-OR) ×100. RESULTS: 3426 individuals with symptoms of 
      COVID-19 were PCR tested between 5 May 2021 and 31 July 2021. The results showed 
      that Sinopharm vaccine 14 days after the second dose was efficient in reducing 
      the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 infection, hospitalisations and mortality by 
      94.3%, 60.5% and 98.6%, respectively, among vaccinated individuals with a 
      significant p value of 0.001. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that BBIBP-CorV 
      vaccine is highly effective in preventing infection, hospitalisations and 
      mortality due to COVID-19.

LID - 10.1080/21645515.2021.1984124 [doi]
AB  - Evidence of BNT126b2 vaccine effectiveness and breakthrough has been primarily 
      demonstrated in populations outside of Asia; studies in the Western Pacific 
      region are limited. Our retrospective cohort study assessed SARS-CoV-2 cases 
      after vaccine rollout starting from mid-March 2021 at a tertiary hospital in 
      Tokyo. Of 8,749 staff members, no fully vaccinated staff demonstrated confirmed 
      infection, versus 19 cases in unvaccinated or partially vaccinated staff, by the 
      end of June. Three breakthrough cases were identified in July, correlating with 
      spread of delta variant in Tokyo. While our findings confirm the effectiveness of 
      BNT162b2 vaccine in Asian populations, the presence of breakthrough cases despite 
      strict infection control regulations suggest that ongoing public hygiene measures 
      are required even after vaccination.

TI  - Expanding COVID-19 Vaccine Availability: Role for Combined Orthogonal Serology 
      Testing (COST).
LID - 10.3390/vaccines9040376 [doi]
LID - 376
AB  - BACKGROUND: The persisting Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and 
      limited vaccine supply has led to a shift in global health priorities to expand 
      vaccine coverage. Relying on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) molecular testing alone cannot reveal the infection proportion, 
      which could play a critical role in vaccination prioritization. We evaluated the 
      utility of a combination orthogonal serological testing (COST) algorithm 
      alongside RT-PCR to quantify prevalence with the aim of identifying candidate 
      patient clusters to receive single and/or delayed vaccination. METHODS: We 
      utilized 108,505 patients with suspected COVID-19 in a retrospective analysis of 
      SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR vs. IgG-nucleocapsid (IgG(NC)) antibody testing coverage in 
      routine practice for the estimation of prevalence. Prospectively, an independent 
      cohort of 21,388 subjects was simultaneously tested by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and 
      IgG(NC) to determine the prevalence. We used 614 prospective study subjects to 
      assess the utility of COST (IgG(NC), IgM-spike (IgM(SP)), and IgG-spike 
      (IgG(SP))) in establishing the infection proportion to identify a single-dose 
      vaccination cohort. RESULTS: Retrospectively, we observed a 6.3% (6871/108,505) 
      positivity for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, and only 2.3% (2533/108,505) of cases had 
      paired IgG(NC) serology performed. Prospectively, IgG(NC) serology identified 
      twice the number of COVID-positive cases in relation to RT-PCR alone. COST 
      further increased the number of detected positive cases: IgG(NC)+ or IgM(SP)+ 
      (18.0%); IgG(NC)+ or IgG(SP)+ (23.5%); IgM(SP)+ or IgG(SP)+ (23.8%); and IgG(NC)+ 
      or IgM(SP)+ or IgG(SP)+ (141/584 = 24.1%). CONCLUSION: COST may be an effective 
      tool for the evaluation of infection proportion and thus could define a cohort 
      for a single dose and/or delayed vaccination.

TI  - Effectiveness of first, second, and third COVID-19 vaccine doses in solid organ 
      transplant recipients: A population-based cohort study from Canada.
PG  - 2228-2236
LID - 10.1111/ajt.17095 [doi]
AB  - Limited data exists on the effectiveness of a third COVID-19 vaccine dose in 
      solid organ transplant recipients. We conducted a population-based cohort study 
      using linked healthcare databases from Ontario, Canada to answer this question. 
      We included solid organ transplant recipients (n = 12,842) as of December 14, 
      2020, with follow-up until November 28, 2021. We used an extended Cox 
      proportional hazards model with vaccination status, including BNT162b2, 
      mRNA-1273, and ChAdOx1 vaccines, modeled as a time-dependent exposure. 
      Individuals started in the unvaccinated category (reference) and could contribute 
      person-time to first, second, and third doses. Over a median follow-up of 
      349 days, 12.7% (n = 1632) remained unvaccinated, 54.1% (n = 6953) received 3 
      doses, and 488 (3.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (of which 260 [53.3%] had a 
      clinically important outcome [i.e., hospitalization or death]). Adjusted vaccine 
      effectiveness against infection was 31% (95% CI: 2, 51%), 46% (95% CI: 21, 63%), 
      and 72% (95% CI: 43, 86%) for one, two, and three doses. Vaccine effectiveness 
      against clinically important outcomes was 38% (95% CI: 4, 61%), 54% (95% CI: 23, 
      73%), and 67% (95% CI: 11, 87%). Vaccine effectiveness in solid organ transplant 
      recipients is lower than the general population, however, vaccine effectiveness 
      improved following a third dose.

TI  - Impact of Delta Variant and Vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 Secondary Attack Rate Among 
      Household Close Contacts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Impact of the Delta variant and vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 
      transmission remains unclear. In Singapore, quarantine of all close contacts, 
      including entry and exit PCR testing, provided the opportunity to determine risk 
      of infection by the Delta variant compared to other variants, vaccine efficacy 
      against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, symptomatic or severe COVID-19, and risk factors 
      associated with SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and symptomatic disease. METHODS: This 
      retrospective cohort study included all close contacts between September 1, 2020 
      and May 31, 2021. Regardless of symptoms, all were quarantined for 14 days with 
      entry and exit PCR testing. Household contacts were defined as individuals who 
      shared a residence with a Covid-19 index case. Secondary attack rates among 
      household close contacts of Delta variant-infected indexes and other 
      variant-infected indexes were derived from prevalence of diagnosed cases among 
      contacts. Relative risk ratios and bootstrapping at the cluster level was used to 
      determine risk of infection by the Delta variant compared to other variants and 
      vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, symptomatic or severe COVID-19. 
      Logistic regression using generalized estimating equations was used to determine 
      risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and symptomatic disease. 
      FINDINGS: Of 1024 household contacts linked to 301 PCR-confirmed index cases, 753 
      (73.5%) were linked to Delta-infected indexes and 248 (24.2%) were exposed to 
      indexes with other variants. Household secondary attack rate among unvaccinated 
      Delta-exposed contacts was 25.8% (95% boostrap confidence interval [BCI] 
      20.6-31.5%) compared with 12.9% (95%BCI 7.0-20.0%) among other variant-exposed 
      contacts. Unvaccinated Delta-exposed contacts were more likely to be infected 
      than those exposed to other variants (Relative risk 2.01, 95%CI 1.24-3.84). Among 
      Delta-exposed contacts, complete vaccination had a vaccine effectiveness of 56.4% 
      (95%BCI 32.6-75.8%) against acquisition, 64.1% (95%BCI 37.8-85.4%) against 
      symptomatic disease and 100% against severe disease. Among Delta-exposed 
      contacts, vaccination status (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.33, 95% robust 
      confidence interval [RCI] 0.17-0.63) and older age of the index (aOR 1.20 per 
      decade, 95%RCI 1.03-1.39) was associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 
      acquisition by the contact. Vaccination status of the index was not associated 
      with a statistically-significant difference for contact SARS-CoV-2 acquisition 
      (aOR 0.73, 95%RCI 0.38-1.40). INTERPRETATION: Increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 Delta 
      acquisition compared with other variants was reduced with vaccination. 
      Close-contacts of vaccinated Delta-infected indexes did not have statistically 
      significant reduced risk of acquisition compared with unvaccinated Delta-infected 
      indexes.

TI  - Analysis of COVID-19 Incidence and Severity Among Adults Vaccinated With 2-Dose 
      mRNA COVID-19 or Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines With and Without Boosters in 
      Singapore.
PG  - e2228900

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Assessing booster effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and 
      inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine over longer time intervals and in response to any 
      further SARS-CoV-2 variants is crucial in determining optimal COVID-19 
      vaccination strategies. OBJECTIVE: To determine levels of protection against 
      severe COVID-19 and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by types and combinations of 
      vaccine boosters in Singapore during the Omicron wave. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included Singapore residents aged 30 years or 
      more vaccinated with either at least 2 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (ie, 
      Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 or Moderna mRNA-1273) or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines 
      (Sinovac CoronaVac or Sinopharm BBIBP-CorV) as of March 10, 2022. Individuals 
      with a known SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to December 27, 2021, an infection on or 
      before the date of their second vaccine dose, or with reinfection cases were 
      excluded. EXPOSURES: Two or 3 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2, Moderna 
      mRNA-1273, Sinovac CoronaVac, or Sinopharm BBIBP-CorV. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Notified infections from December 27, 2021, to March 10, 2022, adjusted 
      for age, sex, race, housing status, and calendar days. Estimated booster 
      effectiveness, defined as the relative incidence-rate reduction of severe disease 
      (supplemental oxygen, intensive care, or death) or confirmed infection following 
      3-dose vaccination compared with 5 months after second mRNA dose, was determined 
      using binomial regression. RESULTS: Among 2 441 581 eligible individuals 
      (1 279 047 [52.4%] women, 846 110 (34.7%) aged 60 years and older), there were 
      319 943 (13.1%) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, of which 1513 (0.4%) were severe 
      COVID-19 cases. mRNA booster effectiveness against confirmed infection 15 to 60 
      days after boosting was estimated to range from 31.7% to 41.3% for the 4 boosting 
      combinations (homologous BNT162b2, homologous mRNA-1273, 2-dose 
      BNT162b2/mRNA-1273 booster, and 2-dose mRNA-1273/BNT162b2 booster). Five months 
      and more after boosting, estimated booster effectiveness against confirmed 
      infection waned, ranging from -2.8% to 14.6%. Against severe COVID-19, estimated 
      mRNA booster effectiveness was 87.4% (95% CI, 83.3%-90.5%) 15 to 60 days after 
      boosting and 87.2% (95% CI, 84.2%-89.7%) 5 to 6 months after boosting, with no 
      significant difference comparing vaccine combinations. Booster effectiveness 
      against severe COVID-19 15 days to 330 days after 3-dose inactivated COVID-19 
      vaccination, regardless of combination, was estimated to be 69.6% (95% CI, 
      48.7%-81.9%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Booster mRNA vaccine protection against 
      severe COVID-19 was estimated to be durable over 6 months. Three-dose inactivated 
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccination provided greater protection than 2-dose but weaker 
      protection compared with 3-dose mRNA.

TI  - Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection during periods of Alpha, 
      Delta, or Omicron dominance: A Danish nationwide study.
PG  - e1004037
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1004037 [doi]
LID - e1004037
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with a prior Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
      Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have a moderate to high degree of protection 
      against reinfection, though seemingly less so when the Omicron variant of 
      SARS-CoV-2 started to circulate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
      vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, Coronavirus Disease 
      2019 (COVID-19)-related hospitalization, and COVID-19-related death, in 
      individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to assess the effect of time 
      since vaccination during periods with different dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants. 
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study used a nationwide cohort design including all 
      individuals with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, who were alive, and residing 
      in Denmark between 1 January 2020 and 31 January 2022. Using Danish nationwide 
      registries, we obtained information on SARS-CoV-2 infections, COVID-19 
      vaccination, age, sex, comorbidity, staying at hospital, and country of origin. 
      The study population included were individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
      Estimates of VE against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection with 95% confidence intervals 
      (CIs) were calculated using a Poisson regression model and adjusted for age, sex, 
      country of origin, comorbidity, staying at hospital, calendar time, and test 
      incidence using a Cox regression model. The VE estimates were calculated 
      separately for three periods with different dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants (Alpha 
      (B.1.1.7), Delta (B.1.617.2), or Omicron (B.1.1.529)) and by time since 
      vaccination using unvaccinated as the reference. In total, 148,527 person-years 
      and 44,192 SARS-CoV-2 infections were included for the analysis regarding 
      reinfections. The study population comprised of 209,814 individuals infected 
      before or during the Alpha period, 292,978 before or during the Delta period, and 
      245,530 before or during the Omicron period. Of these, 40,281 individuals had 
      completed their primary vaccination series during the Alpha period (19.2%), 
      190,026 during the Delta period (64.9%), and 158,563 during the Omicron period 
      (64.6%). VE against reinfection following any COVID-19 vaccine type administered 
      in Denmark, peaked at 71% (95% CI: -Inf to 100%) at 104 days or more after 
      vaccination during the Alpha period, 94% (95% CI: 92% to 96%) 14 to 43 days after 
      vaccination during the Delta period, and 60% (95% CI: 58% to 62%) 14 to 43 days 
      after vaccination during the Omicron period. Waning immunity following 
      vaccination was observed and was most pronounced during the Omicron period. Due 
      to too few events, it was not possible to estimate VE for hospitalization and 
      death. Study limitations include potentially undetected reinfections, differences 
      in health-seeking behavior, or risk behavior between the compared groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that in previously infected individuals, completing 
      a primary vaccination series was associated with a significant protection against 
      SARS-CoV-2 reinfection compared with no vaccination. Even though vaccination 
      seems to protect to a lesser degree against reinfection with the Omicron variant, 
      these findings are of public health relevance as they show that previously 
      infected individuals still benefit from COVID-19 vaccination in all three variant 
      periods.

TI  - Third dose vaccination with mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 vaccines improves protection 
      against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - As of 2021 November 29, booster vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection has been 
      recommended for all individuals aged 18 years and older in the United States. A 
      key reason for this recommendation is the expectation that a booster vaccine dose 
      can alleviate observed waning of vaccine effectiveness (VE). Although initial 
      reports of booster effectiveness have been positive, the level of protection from 
      booster vaccination is unclear. We conducted two studies to assess the impact of 
      booster vaccination, with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 
      infection between August and December 2021. We first compared SARS-CoV-2 
      infection incidence in cohorts of 3-dose vaccine recipients to incidence in 
      matched cohorts of 2-dose vaccine recipients (cohort size = 24,539 for BNT162b2 
      and 14,004 for mRNA-1273). Additionally, we applied a test-negative study design 
      to compare the level of protection against symptomatic infection in 3-dose 
      recipients to that observed in recent 2-dose primary vaccine series recipients. 
      The 3-dose recipients experienced a significantly lower incidence rate of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection than the matched 2-dose cohorts (BNT162b2 Incidence Rate 
      Ratio: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.13 and mRNA-1273 IRR: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.15). 
      Results from the test-negative study showed the third vaccine dose mitigated 
      waning of VE, with the risk of symptomatic infection in 3-dose recipients being 
      comparable to that observed 7 to 73 days after the primary vaccine series. These 
      results show that 3-dose vaccine regimens with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 are 
      effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection and support the widespread 
      administration of booster vaccine doses.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates are essential to 
      identify potential groups at higher risk of break-through infections and to guide 
      policy. We assessed the VE of COVID-19 vaccination against COVID-19 
      hospitalization, while adjusting and stratifying for patient characteristics. 
      METHODS: We performed a test-negative case-control study in six Dutch hospitals. 
      The study population consisted of adults eligible for COVID-19 vaccination 
      hospitalized between May 1 and June 28, 2021 with respiratory symptoms. Cases 
      were defined as patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR during the 
      first 48 h of admission or within 14 days prior to hospital admission. Controls 
      were patients tested negative at admission and did not have a positive test 
      during the 2 weeks prior to hospitalization. VE was calculated using 
      multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for calendar week, sex, age, 
      comorbidity and nursing home residency. Subgroup analysis was performed for age, 
      sex and different comorbidities. Secondary endpoints were ICU-admission and 
      mortality. RESULTS: 379 cases and 255 controls were included of whom 157 (18%) 
      were vaccinated prior to admission. Five cases (1%) and 40 controls (16%) were 
      fully vaccinated (VE: 93%; 95% CI: 81 - 98), and 40 cases (11%) and 70 controls 
      (27%) were partially vaccinated (VE: 70%; 95% CI: 50-82). A strongly protective 
      effect of vaccination was found in all comorbidity subgroups. No ICU-admission or 
      mortality were reported among fully vaccinated cases. Of unvaccinated cases, 
      mortality was 10% and 19% was admitted at the ICU. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 
      vaccination provides a strong protective effect against COVID-19 related hospital 
      admission, in patients with and without comorbidity.

AB  - The objective of this article is to draw lessons from the Thai experience in 
      estimating vaccine effectiveness (VE) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      based on routine service data. We found that a matched case-control design, using 
      probability-based controls representing the varying vaccine coverage across the 
      population over time, yielded a valid result for VE assessment. The proposed 
      design has an advantage in its applicability drawing from the routine data 
      monitoring system. Future studies that exercise other designs, such as 
      test-negative and cohort studies, are recommended in order to compare and 
      contrast the findings across different designs. To implement a continuous 
      monitoring system on VE, the integration of data from different sources is 
      needed. This requires long-term investment in the data monitoring system for the 
      entire healthcare system.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination Coverage and Factors Associated with Low Uptake in a 
      Cohort of People Living with HIV.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10081666 [doi]
LID - 1666
AB  - People living with HIV (PLWH) are prioritised for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination due to 
      their vulnerability to severe COVID-19. Therefore, the epidemiological 
      surveillance of vaccination coverage and the timely identification of 
      suboptimally vaccinated PLWH is vital. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 vaccination 
      coverage and factors associated with under-vaccination among PLWH in Catalonia, 
      Spain. As of 11.12.2021, 9945/14942 PLWH (66.6%) had received ≥1 dose of a 
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Non-Spanish origin (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.64, 95% CI 
      0.59-0.70), CD4 count of 200-349 cells/μL (aOR 0.74, 95% CI 0.64-0.86) or 350-499 
      cells/μL (aOR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70-0.88), detectable plasma HIV-RNA (aOR 0.61 95% CI 
      0.53-0.70), and previous SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (aOR 0.58 95% CI 0.51-0.65) were 
      associated with under-vaccination. SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (437 [9.5%] vs. 323 
      [3.5%], p &lt; 0.001), associated hospitalisations (10 [2.3%] vs. 0 [0%], p &lt; 
      0.001), intensive care unit admissions (6 [1.4%] vs. 0 [0%], p &lt; 0.001), and 
      deaths (10 [2.3%] vs. 0 [0%], p &lt; 0.001) were higher among unvaccinated PLWH. 
      Vaccination coverage was lower among PLWH with a CD4 count &gt;200 cells/μL, 
      detectable plasma HIV-RNA, previous SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, and migrants. 
      SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, associated hospitalisations, and deaths among PLWH were 
      lower among the vaccinated compared with the unvaccinated. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination 
      prioritisation has not completely reached vulnerable PLWH with poorer prognosis. 
      This information can be used to inform public health strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of heterologous prime-boost Coronavirus disease 
      2019 (Covid-19) vaccination is currently unknown. METHODS: From individuals 
      vaccinated with two doses against Covid-19 in Sweden until July 5, 2021 
      (N=3,445,061), we formed a study cohort including 94,569 individuals that had 
      received heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 / BNT162b2 prime-boost vaccination, 16,402 
      individuals that received heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 / mRNA-1273 prime-boost 
      vaccination, and 430,100 individuals that received homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 / 
      ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost vaccination. In addition, 180,716 individuals were 
      selected who were unvaccinated at the date of vaccination in the corresponding 
      case. Unvaccinated individuals were censored at first dose of any vaccine. 
      Baseline was the date of the second dose of any vaccine, with the same date in 
      the corresponding unvaccinated individual. The outcome included incident 
      symptomatic Covid-19 infection occurring >14 days after baseline. FINDINGS: 
      During a mean follow-up time of 76 (range 1-183) days, symptomatic Covid-19 
      infection was confirmed in 187 individuals with heterologous vaccine schedules 
      (incidence rate: 2.0/100,000 person-days) and in 306 individuals from the 
      unvaccinated control group (incidence rate: 7.1/100,000 person-days). The 
      adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 67% (95% CI, 59-73, P<0.001) for heterologous 
      ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 / BNT162b2 prime-boost vaccination, and 79% (95% CI, 62-88, 
      P<0.001) for heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 / mRNA-1273 prime-boost vaccination. 
      When combined and analysed together, the two heterologous vaccine schedules had 
      an effectiveness of 68% (95% CI, 61-74, P<0.001) which was significantly greater 
      (P(interaction)<0.001) than the 50% effectiveness for homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 
      / ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (95% CI, 41-58, P<0.001). INTERPRETATION: The findings of this 
      study suggest that the use of heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and mRNA prime-boost 
      vaccination is an effective alternative to increase population immunity against 
      Covid-19, including against the Delta variant which dominated the confirmed cases 
      during the study period. These findings could have important implications for 
      vaccination strategies and logistics, and consequently in the battle against the 
      Covid-19 pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 beyond 6 months remains 
      incompletely understood. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of COVID-19 
      vaccination against the risk of infection, hospitalisation, and death during the 
      first 9 months after vaccination for the total population of Sweden. METHODS: 
      This retrospective, total population cohort study was done using data from 
      Swedish nationwide registers. The cohort comprised all individuals vaccinated 
      with two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, mRNA-1273, or BNT162b2, and matched 
      unvaccinated individuals, with data on vaccinations and infections updated until 
      Oct 4, 2021. Two outcomes were evaluated. The first was SARS-CoV-2 infection of 
      any severity from Jan 12 to Oct 4, 2021. The second was severe COVID-19, defined 
      as hospitalisation for COVID-19 or all-cause 30-day mortality after confirmed 
      infection, from March 15 to Sept 28, 2021. FINDINGS: Between Dec 28, 2020, and 
      Oct 4, 2021, 842 974 individuals were fully vaccinated (two doses), and were 
      matched (1:1) to an equal number of unvaccinated individuals (total study cohort 
      n=1 685 948). For the outcome SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity, the vaccine 
      effectiveness of BNT162b2 waned progressively over time, from 92% (95% CI 92 to 
      93; p<0·001) at 15-30 days, to 47% (39 to 55; p<0·001) at 121-180 days, and to 
      23% (-2 to 41; p=0·07) from day 211 onwards. Waning was slightly slower for 
      mRNA-1273, with a vaccine effectiveness of 96% (94 to 97; p<0·001) at 15-30 days 
      and 59% (18 to 79; p=0·012) from day 181 onwards. Waning was also slightly slower 
      for heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 plus an mRNA vaccine, for which vaccine 
      effectiveness was 89% (79 to 94; p<0·001) at 15-30 days and 66% (41 to 80; 
      p<0·001) from day 121 onwards. By contrast, vaccine effectiveness for homologous 
      ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was 68% (52 to 79; p<0·001) at 15-30 days, with no 
      detectable effectiveness from day 121 onwards (-19% [-98 to 28]; p=0·49). For the 
      outcome of severe COVID-19, vaccine effectiveness waned from 89% (82 to 93; 
      p<0·001) at 15-30 days to 64% (44 to 77; p<0·001) from day 121 onwards. Overall, 
      there was some evidence for lower vaccine effectiveness in men than in women and 
      in older individuals than in younger individuals. INTERPRETATION: We found 
      progressively waning vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection of any 
      severity across all subgroups, but the rate of waning differed according to 
      vaccine type. With respect to severe COVID-19, vaccine effectiveness seemed to be 
      better maintained, although some waning became evident after 4 months. The 
      results strengthen the evidence-based rationale for administration of a third 
      vaccine dose as a booster. FUNDING: None.

TI  - Effectiveness of a fourth dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine against all-cause

      nationwide, retrospective cohort study in Sweden.
PG  - 100466

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of a fourth dose of COVID-19 vaccine on the risk of death 
      in the oldest and frailest individuals is unknown. METHODS: Two matched cohorts 
      were formed using Swedish nationwide registers. In the first, residents of 
      long-term care facilities (LTCFs) given a fourth dose of an mRNA vaccine from 1 
      January 2022 onwards were matched 1:1 on birth year and county of residence to 
      residents given at least a third dose (N = 24,524). In the second, all 
      individuals aged ≥80 years given a fourth dose were matched 1:1 to individuals 
      given at least a third dose (N = 394,104). Cox regression models were used to 
      estimate hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in fourth-dose recipients as 
      compared with in third-dose recipients, with relative vaccine effectiveness (VE) 
      estimated as 1 minus the hazard ratio. FINDINGS: From 7 days after baseline and 
      onwards, there were 1119 deaths in the LTCF cohort during a median follow-up of 
      77 days and a maximum follow-up of 126 days. During days 7 to 60, the VE of the 
      fourth dose was 39% (95% CI, 29-48), which declined to 27% (95% CI, -2-48) during 
      days 61 to 126. In the cohort of all individuals aged ≥80 years, there were 5753 
      deaths during a median follow-up of 73 days and a maximum follow-up of 143 days. 
      During days 7 to 60, the VE of the fourth dose was 71% (95% CI, 69-72), which 
      declined to 54% (95% CI, 48-60) during days 61 to 143. The VE of the fourth dose 
      seemed stronger when it was compared to third-dose recipients where at least four 
      months had passed since vaccination (P < 0·001 for interaction). INTERPRETATION: 
      As compared with a third dose, a fourth dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, 
      administered during the Omicron era, was associated with reduced risk of death 
      from all causes in residents of LTCFs and in the oldest old during the first two 
      months, after which the protection became slightly lower. These findings suggest 
      that a fourth dose may prevent premature mortality in the oldest and frailest 
      even after the emergence of the Omicron variant, although the timing of 
      vaccination seems to be important with respect to the slight waning observed 
      after two months. FUNDING: There was no funding source for this study.

      measured in 1,880,351 older adults. VE against hospitalisations was 94% (95% 
      confidence interval (CI): 88-97) and 82% (95% CI: 72-89) for those 65-79 and ≥ 80 
      years old, with no evidence of waning 98 days after dose two. VE against 
      mortality was 96% (95% CI: 92-98) and 81% (95% CI: 74-87) in these two age 
      groups.

TI  - Incidence and clinical phenotype of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children 
      after infection with the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant by vaccination status: a Danish 
      nationwide prospective cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) occurs after 
      infection with SARS-CoV-2 and its incidence is likely to depend on multiple 
      factors, including the variant of the preceding SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine 
      effectiveness. We aimed to estimate the incidence of MIS-C, and describe the 
      clinical phenotype, following the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2 and 
      sublineages) according to vaccination status. We aimed to compare the incidence 
      and clinical phenotype of MIS-C from our cohort during the pre-delta era. 
      METHODS: This prospective, population-based cohort study included patients aged 
      0-17 years hospitalised with MIS-C in Denmark, according to the US Centers for 
      Disease Control and Prevention case definition, from Aug 1, 2021, to Feb 1, 2022, 
      a period dominated by the delta variant. We identified MIS-C cases via a 
      nationwide research collaboration involving real-time data collection from all 18 
      paediatric departments. Aggregated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections by vaccination 
      status was obtained from the Danish COVID-19 surveillance registries. The 
      incidence of MIS-C was calculated using the estimated number of infected 
      individuals by vaccination status. We calculated the incidence of MIS-C per 
      1 000 000 vaccinated and unvaccinated person-years, and estimated vaccine 
      effectiveness as 1-incidence rate ratio using Poisson regression. Incidence and 
      phenotype of MIS-C were compared with MIS-C cases from the first year of the 
      pandemic. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05186597. FINDINGS: 
      We identified 51 MIS-C cases among unvaccinated individuals and one in a fully 
      vaccinated adolescent. The incidence of MIS-C was one in 3400 unvaccinated 
      individuals (95% CI 2600-4600) with the delta variant and one in 9900 vaccinated 
      individuals (95% CI 1800-390 000) with breakthrough infection. The estimated 
      vaccine effectiveness against MIS-C after the delta variant was 94% (95% CI 
      55-99; p=0·0061) in individuals aged 5-17 years. The clinical phenotype during 
      the delta wave was comparable to the pre-delta era. INTERPRETATION: We found the 
      incidence and phenotype of MIS-C in unvaccinated children during the delta wave 
      to be similar to the incidence during the first year of the pandemic. We found 
      vaccine effectiveness to be high against MIS-C, which we suggest was due to 
      protection from infection and, possibly, a decreased incidence of MIS-C after 
      breakthrough infection. Knowledge of the incidence of MIS-C after different 
      SARS-CoV-2 variants and the effect of vaccination might contribute to the 
      elucidation of the extent to which MIS-C is a vaccine-preventable disease.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We surveyed a cohort of patients who recovered from severe 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection to determine the COVID-19 vaccination rate. We also compared 
      the willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccine before and after its availability to 
      assess changes in perception and attitude towards vaccination. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Recovered patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure from 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection treated in the ICU at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, 
      Georgia between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020 were followed up over a 1-year 
      period to assess vaccine acceptability and acceptance rates, and changes in 
      perception towards COVID-19 vaccination before and after vaccine availability. 
      RESULTS: A total of 98 and 93 patients completed the initial and follow up 
      surveys respectively. During the initial survey, 41% of the patients intended to 
      receive vaccination, 46% responded they would not accept a vaccine against 
      COVID-19 even if it were proven to be 'safe and effective 'and 13% undecided. 
      During the follow up survey, 44% of the study cohort had received at least one 
      dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Major reasons provided by respondents for not 
      accepting COVID-19 vaccine were lack of trust in the effectiveness of the 
      vaccine, pharmaceutical companies, government, vaccine technology, fear of side 
      effects and perceived immunity against COVID-19. Respondents were more likely to 
      be vaccinated if recommended by their physicians (OR 6.4, 95% CI 2.8-8.3), 
      employers (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.9-5.8), and family and friends (OR 1.6, 95% CI 
      1.1-4.5). CONCLUSION: We found a suboptimal COVID-19 vaccination rate in a cohort 
      of patients who recovered from severe infection. COVID-19 vaccine information and 
      recommendation by healthcare providers, employers, and family and friends may 
      improve vaccination uptake.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The emergence of the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2 has led 
      to increases in both infections and hospitalizations among adolescents. Little is 
      known about the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine in adolescents in the 
      general population, as opposed to a clinical trial population. OBJECTIVE: To 
      estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine in adolescents aged 12 to 18 
      years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a matched case-control study 
      among adolescents (aged 12-18 years) who had results from a SARS-CoV-2 reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Immunization histories, 
      relevant clinical data, and RT-PCR test results were obtained from the Yale New 
      Haven Health System's medical records between June 1, 2021, and August 15, 2021, 
      when the Delta variant caused 92% of infections in Connecticut. Case participants 
      were defined as adolescents who had a positive test result and an associated 
      medical encounter. Control participants were defined as those who had a negative 
      test result and were matched to a case participant by age, county of residence, 
      and date of testing. EXPOSURES: Adolescents were defined as fully immunized if 
      they had received 2 doses of vaccine at least 14 days before focal time. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measured was SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      confirmed by RT-PCR. The vaccine's effectiveness (VE) was estimated using matched 
      odds ratios from conditional logistic regression models. Secondary measures 
      included estimated VE by clinical symptoms, number of vaccine doses received, and 
      elapsed time from immunization. RESULTS: A total of 6901 adolescents were tested 
      for SARS-CoV-2. The final sample comprised 186 case participants and 356 matched 
      control participants. The median age was 14 (IQR, 13-16) years, 262 (48%) 
      identified as female, 81 (15%) as Black, 82 (15%) as Hispanic, and 297 (55%) as 
      White. Overall, 134 (25%) were fully immunized (case participants, 10 [5%]; 
      control participants, 124 [35%]). The median time between immunization and the 
      SARS-CoV-2 test was 62 days (range, 17-129 days). Within 4 months of receiving 2 
      doses, VE against any infection was estimated to be 91% (95% CI, 80%-96%); 
      against asymptomatic infection, 85% (95% CI, 57%-95%). Effectiveness after a 
      single dose was estimated to be 74% (95% CI, 18%-92%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      In this retrospective case-control study of US adolescents, 2 doses of BNT162b2 
      vaccine appeared to provide excellent protection for at least 4 months after 
      immunization against both symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.

TI  - Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 variants in adolescents from 15 to 90 
      days after second dose: a population-based test-negative case-control study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization and 
      severe illness in adolescents due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants (gamma, 
      delta, and omicron). STUDY DESIGN: A test-negative, case-control analysis was 
      conducted in Brazil from July 2021 to March 2022. We enrolled 8,458 eligible 
      individuals (12 - 19 years of age) hospitalized with an acute respiratory 
      syndrome, including 3,075 cases with laboratory-proven COVID-19 and 4,753 
      controls with negative tests for COVID-19. The primary exposure of interest was 
      vaccination status. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection during 
      gamma/delta vs. omicron-predominant periods. The adjusted odds ratio for the 
      association of prior vaccination and outcomes was used to estimate VE. RESULTS: 
      In the pre-omicron period, VE against COVID-19 hospitalization was 88% (95%CI, 
      83% to 92%) and has dropped to 59% (95%CI, 49% to 66%) during the omicron period. 
      For hospitalized cases of COVID-19, considering the entire period of the 
      analysis, 2-dose schedule was moderately effective against ICU admission (46%, 
      [95%CI, 27 to 60]), need of mechanical ventilation (49%, [95%CI, 32 to 70]), 
      severe COVID-19 (42%, [95%CI, 17 to 60]), and death (46%, [95%CI, 8 to 67]). 
      There was a substantial reduction of about 40% in the VE against all endpoints, 
      except for death, during the omicron-predominant period. Among cases, 240 (6.6%) 
      adolescents died; of fatal cases, 224 (93.3%) were not fully vaccinated. 
      CONCLUSION: Among adolescents, the VE against all endpoints was substantially 
      reduced during the omicron-predominant period. Our findings suggest that the 
      two-dose regimen may be insufficient for SARS-CoV-2 variants and support the need 
      for updated vaccines to provide better protection against severe COVID-19.

TI  - Vaccine Effectiveness Against SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Severe Outcomes in the 
      Maintenance Dialysis Population in Ontario, Canada.
PG  - 839-849
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2021091262 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaccination studies in the hemodialysis population have demonstrated 
      decreased antibody response compared with healthy controls, but vaccine 
      effectiveness for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease is 
      undetermined. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in the province 
      of Ontario, Canada, between December 21, 2020, and June 30, 2021. Receipt of 
      vaccine, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and related severe outcomes (hospitalization or 
      death) were determined from provincial health administrative data. Receipt of one 
      and two doses of vaccine were modeled in a time-varying cause-specific Cox 
      proportional hazards model, adjusting for baseline characteristics, background 
      community infection rates, and censoring for non-COVID death, recovered kidney 
      function, transfer out of province, solid organ transplant, and withdrawal from 
      dialysis. RESULTS: Among 13,759 individuals receiving maintenance dialysis, 2403 
      (17%) were unvaccinated and 11,356 (83%) had received at least one dose by June 
      30, 2021. Vaccine types were BNT162b2 (n=8455, 74%) and mRNA-1273 (n=2901, 26%); 
      median time between the first and second dose was 36 days (IQR 28-51). The 
      adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes for one 
      dose compared with unvaccinated was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.46 to 0.76) and 0.54 (95% CI, 
      0.37 to 0.77), respectively, and for two doses compared with unvaccinated was 
      0.31 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.42) and 0.17 (95% CI, 0.1 to 0.3), respectively. There 
      were no significant differences in vaccine effectiveness among age groups, 
      dialysis modality, or vaccine type. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccination is 
      effective in the dialysis population to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe 
      outcomes, despite concerns about suboptimal antibody responses.

TI  - Effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA Vaccination Against COVID-19 
      Hospitalization Among Persons Aged 12-18 Years - United States, June-September 
      2021.
PG  - 1483-1488
LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm7042e1 [doi]
AB  - Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for use in children and 
      adolescents aged 12-15 years and is licensed by the Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA) for persons aged ≥16 (1). A randomized placebo-controlled trial 
      demonstrated an efficacy of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 75.3%-100%) in 
      preventing outpatient COVID-19 in persons aged 12-15 years (2); however, data 
      among adolescents on vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 in real-world 
      settings are limited, especially among hospitalized patients. In early September 
      2021, U.S. pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations reached the highest level during 
      the pandemic (3,4). In a test-negative, case-control study at 19 pediatric 
      hospitals in 16 states during June 1-September 30, 2021, the effectiveness of 2 
      doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against COVID-19 hospitalization was assessed 
      among children and adolescents aged 12-18 years. Among 464 hospitalized persons 
      aged 12-18 years (179 case-patients and 285 controls), the median age was 15 
      years, 72% had at least one underlying condition, including obesity, and 68% 
      attended in-person school. Effectiveness of 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine 
      against COVID-19 hospitalization was 93% (95% CI = 83%-97%), during the period 
      when B.1.617.2 (Delta) was the predominant variant. This evaluation demonstrated 
      that 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are highly effective at preventing 
      COVID-19 hospitalization among persons aged 12-18 years and reinforces the 
      importance of vaccination to protect U.S. youths against severe COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The increasing incidence of pediatric hospitalizations associated 
      with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) caused by the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant 
      of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the United 
      States has offered an opportunity to assess the real-world effectiveness of the 
      BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccine in adolescents between 12 and 18 years of age. 
      METHODS: We used a case-control, test-negative design to assess vaccine 
      effectiveness against Covid-19 resulting in hospitalization, admission to an 
      intensive care unit (ICU), the use of life-supporting interventions (mechanical 
      ventilation, vasopressors, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), or death. 
      Between July 1 and October 25, 2021, we screened admission logs for eligible case 
      patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 at 31 hospitals in 23 states. We 
      estimated vaccine effectiveness by comparing the odds of antecedent full 
      vaccination (two doses of BNT162b2) in case patients as compared with two 
      hospital-based control groups: patients who had Covid-19-like symptoms but 
      negative results on testing for SARS-CoV-2 (test-negative) and patients who did 
      not have Covid-19-like symptoms (syndrome-negative). RESULTS: A total of 445 case 
      patients and 777 controls were enrolled. Overall, 17 case patients (4%) and 282 
      controls (36%) had been fully vaccinated. Of the case patients, 180 (40%) were 
      admitted to the ICU, and 127 (29%) required life support; only 2 patients in the 
      ICU had been fully vaccinated. The overall effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine 
      against hospitalization for Covid-19 was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90 to 
      96); the effectiveness was 95% (95% CI, 91 to 97) among test-negative controls 
      and 94% (95% CI, 89 to 96) among syndrome-negative controls. The effectiveness 
      was 98% against ICU admission and 98% against Covid-19 resulting in the receipt 
      of life support. All 7 deaths occurred in patients who were unvaccinated. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized adolescent patients, two doses of the BNT162b2 
      vaccine were highly effective against Covid-19-related hospitalization and ICU 
      admission or the receipt of life support. (Funded by the Centers for Disease 
      Control and Prevention.).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In August 2021, 6 months after mass vaccination of the Israeli 
      population with the two-dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, a surge of coronavirus 
      disease 2019 infections, mostly from the delta variant, appeared also among the 
      vaccinated. In response, the Israeli Ministry of Health initiated a booster 
      (third dose) vaccination program. We assessed the protective effect of the third 
      dose among health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: Infections with severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 are monitored systematically among HCWs at the 
      Hadassah tertiary care medical centre in Jerusalem, Israel. In this cohort, we 
      included breakthrough infections, defined as those occurring >180 days since the 
      second vaccine dose. The follow-up period lasted 120 days. We compared infection 
      rates between HCWs who received the booster dose and those who received only the 
      two-dose regimen. RESULTS: The rate of breakthrough infections among HCWs who 
      received only the two-dose regimen was 21.4% (85 of 398). The rate in the boosted 
      group was 0.7% (35/4973; relative risk 30, 95% CI 20-50). Those results were seen 
      in all age groups. DISCUSSION: The significantly lower rate of breakthrough 
      infections in boosted HCWs indicates substantial protection by a third vaccine 
      dose.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Randomized clinical trials and observational studies have 
      demonstrated high overall effectiveness for the three US-authorized COVID-19 
      vaccines against symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Nevertheless, the challenges 
      associated with the use of observational data can undermine the results of the 
      studies. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of using observational data for 
      vaccine effectiveness studies by examining granular weekly effectiveness. DESIGN 
      SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used Columbia 
      University Medical Center data linked to State and City Immunization Registries 
      to assess the weekly effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. We conducted manual 
      chart review of cases in week one in both groups along with a set of sensitivity 
      analyses for Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen vaccines. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: We used propensity score matching with up to 54,987 covariates and 
      fitted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios and constructed 
      Kaplan-Meier plots for two main outcomes (COVID-19 infection and 
      COVID-19-associated hospitalization). RESULTS: The study included 179,666 
      patients. We observed increasing effectiveness after the first dose of mRNA 
      vaccines with week 6 effectiveness approximating 84% (95% CI 72-91%) for COVID-19 
      infection and 86% (95% CI 69-95) for COVID-19-associated hospitalization. When 
      analyzing unexpectedly high effectiveness in week one, chart review revealed that 
      vaccinated patients are less likely to seek care after vaccination and are more 
      likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 during the encounters for other conditions. 
      Sensitivity analyses showed potential outcome misclassification for COVID-19 
      ICD10-CM diagnosis and the influence of excluding patients with prior COVID-19 
      infection and anchoring in the unexposed group. Overall vaccine effectiveness 
      analysis in fully vaccinated patients matched the results of the randomized 
      trials. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Observational data can be used to ascertain 
      vaccine effectiveness if potential biases are accounted for. The data need to be 
      scrutinized to ensure that compared groups exhibit similar health seeking 
      behavior and are equally likely to be captured in the data. Given the difference 
      in temporal trends of vaccine exposure and baseline characteristics, indirect 
      comparison of vaccines may produce biased results. KEY POINTS: Question: When 
      accounted for all potential biases, what is the weekly effectiveness of COVID-19 
      vaccines?Findings: In this cohort study we replicated the results of randomized 
      clinical trials, discovered plausible increase in effectiveness after week one 
      following the first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and found differences in 
      temporal trends of vaccine exposure and baseline characteristics in vaccinated 
      groups.Meaning: Observational data can be used to reliably estimate vaccine 
      effectiveness if the biases are accounted for. Vaccines need to be directly 
      compared.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness over six 7-day intervals 
      after the first dose and assess underlying bias in observational data. DESIGN AND 
      SETTING: Retrospective cohort study using Columbia University Irving Medical 
      Center data linked to state and city immunisation registries. OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: We used large-scale propensity score matching with up to 54 987 
      covariates, fitted Cox proportional hazards models and constructed Kaplan-Meier 
      plots for two main outcomes (COVID-19 infection and COVID-19-associated 
      hospitalisation). We conducted manual chart review of cases in week 1 in both 
      groups along with a set of secondary analyses for other index date, outcome and 
      population choices. RESULTS: The study included 179 666 patients. We observed 
      increasing effectiveness after the first dose of mRNA vaccines with week 6 
      effectiveness approximating 84% (95% CI 72% to 91%) for COVID-19 infection and 
      86% (95% CI 69% to 95%) for COVID-19-associated hospitalisation. When analysing 
      unexpectedly high effectiveness in week 1, chart review revealed that vaccinated 
      patients are less likely to seek care after vaccination and are more likely to be 
      diagnosed with COVID-19 during the encounters for other conditions. Secondary 
      analyses highlighted potential outcome misclassification for International 
      Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis, the 
      influence of excluding patients with prior COVID-19 infection and anchoring in 
      the unexposed group. Long-term vaccine effectiveness in fully vaccinated patients 
      matched the results of the randomised trials. CONCLUSIONS: For vaccine 
      effectiveness studies, observational data need to be scrutinised to ensure 
      compared groups exhibit similar health-seeking behaviour and are equally likely 
      to be captured in the data. While we found that studies may be capable of 
      accurately estimating long-term effectiveness despite bias in early weeks, the 
      early week results should be reported in every study so that we may gain a better 
      understanding of the biases. Given the difference in temporal trends of vaccine 
      exposure and patients' baseline characteristics, indirect comparison of vaccines 
      may produce biased results.

TI  - Clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with one, two 
      and three doses of vaccination against COVID-19 in Australia.
LID - 10.1111/imj.15884 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaccination has been shown to be highly effective in preventing death 
      and severe disease from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Currently, few studies have directly compared vaccinated 
      and unvaccinated patients with severe COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU). 
      AIMS: To compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of vaccine recipients 
      and unvaccinated patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the ICU in a 
      nationwide setting. METHODS: Data were extracted from the Short PeRiod IncideNce 
      sTudy of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Australia, in 57 ICU during Delta and 
      Omicron predominant periods of the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome was 
      inhospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included duration of mechanical 
      ventilation, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay and ICU mortality. 
      RESULTS:  There were 2970 patients admitted to ICU across participating sites 
      from 26 June 2021 to 8 February 2022; 1134 (38.2%) patients were vaccine 
      recipients, and 1836 (61.8%) patients were unvaccinated. Vaccine recipients were 
      older, more comorbid and less likely to require organ support. Unadjusted 
      inhospital mortality was greater in the vaccinated cohort. After adjusting for 
      age, gender and comorbid status, no statistically significant association between 
      inhospital or ICU mortality, and vaccination status, was apparent. CONCLUSION: We 
      found COVID-19 infection can cause severe disease and death in vaccine 
      recipients, though comorbid status and older age were significant contributors to 
      mortality. Organ support requirements and the number of deaths were highest in 
      the unvaccinated cohort.

TI  - CoronaVac vaccine is effective in preventing symptomatic and severe COVID-19 in 
      pregnant women in Brazil: a test-negative case-control study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: More doses of CoronaVac have been administered worldwide than any 
      other COVID-19 vaccine. However, the effectiveness of COVID-19 inactivated 
      vaccines in pregnant women is still unknown. We estimated the vaccine 
      effectiveness (VE) of CoronaVac against symptomatic and severe COVID-19 in 
      pregnant women in Brazil. METHODS: We conducted a test-negative design study in 
      all pregnant women aged 18-49 years with COVID-19-related symptoms in Brazil from 
      March 15, 2021, to October 03, 2021, linking records of negative and positive 
      SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests to 
      national vaccination records. We also linked records of test-positive cases with 
      notifications of severe, hospitalised or fatal COVID-19. Using logistic 
      regression, we estimated the adjusted odds ratio and VE against symptomatic 
      COVID-19 and against severe COVID-19 by comparing vaccine status in test-negative 
      subjects to test-positive symptomatic cases and severe cases. RESULTS: Of the 
      19,838 tested pregnant women, 7424 (37.4%) tested positive for COVID-19 and 588 
      (7.9%) had severe disease. Only 83% of pregnant women who received the first dose 
      of CoronaVac completed the vaccination scheme. A single dose of the CoronaVac 
      vaccine was not effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19. The effectiveness 
      of two doses of CoronaVac was 41% (95% CI 27.1-52.2) against symptomatic COVID-19 
      and 85% (95% CI 59.5-94.8) against severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: A complete 
      regimen of CoronaVac in pregnant women was effective in preventing symptomatic 
      COVID-19 and highly effective against severe illness in a setting that combined 
      high disease burden and marked COVID-19-related maternal deaths.

TI  - Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccination in Preventing All-Cause Mortality among 
      Adults during the Third Wave of the Epidemic in Hungary: Nationwide Retrospective 
      Cohort Study.
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10071009 [doi]
LID - 1009
AB  - Our investigation aimed to describe the all-cause mortality rates by COVID-19 
      vaccination groups in Hungary for an epidemic period (1 April 2021-20 June 2021) 
      and a nonepidemic period (21 June 2021-15 August 2021), and to determine the 
      vaccines' effectiveness in preventing all-cause mortality utilizing nonepidemic 
      effectiveness measures to adjust for the healthy vaccinee effect (HVE). 
      Sociodemographic status, comorbidity, primary care structural characteristics, 
      and HVE-adjusted survival difference between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated 
      cohorts in the epidemic period had been computed by Cox regression models, 
      separately for each vaccine (six vaccines were available in Hungary). Hazard 
      ratio (HR) reduction in epidemic period corrected with nonepidemic period's HR 
      with 95% confidence interval for each vaccine was used to describe the vaccine 
      effectiveness (VE). The whole adult population (N = 6,404,702) of the country was 
      followed in this study (4,026,849 fully vaccinated). Each vaccine could reduce 
      the HVE-corrected all-cause mortality in the epidemic period 
      (VE(Oxford/AstraZeneca) = 0.592 [0.518-0.655], VE(Janssen) = 0.754 [0.628-0.838], 
      VE(Moderna) = 0.573 [0.526-0.615], VE(Pfizer-BioNTech) = 0.487 [0.461-0.513], 
      VE(Sinopharm) = 0.530 [0.496-0.561], and VE(Sputnik)&amp;nbsp;(V) = 0.557 
      [0.493-0.614]). The HVE-corrected general mortality for COVID-19 vaccine cohorts 
      demonstrated the real-life effectiveness of vaccines applied in Hungary, and the 
      usefulness of this indicator to convince vaccine hesitants.

AB  - We performed a review study according to recent COVID-19 vaccines' real-world 
      data to provide comparisons between COVID-19 vaccines regarding their relative 
      efficacy. Although most vaccine platforms showed comparable effectiveness and 
      efficacy, we highlight critical points and recent developments generated in 
      studies that might affect vaccine efficacy including population-dependent effects 
      of the vaccine (transplantation, adiposity, and specific comorbidities, as well 
      as older age, male sex, ethnicity, and prior infection), vaccine type, variants 
      of concern (VOC), and an extended vaccine schedule. Owing to these factors, 
      community-based trials can be of great importance in determining vaccine 
      effectiveness in a systematic manner; thus, uncertainty remains regarding vaccine 
      efficacy. Long immune protection of vaccination with BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 
      has been demonstrated to be up to 61 months and 5-12 months after the previous 
      infection, and boosting infection-acquired immunity for both the first and second 
      doses of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines was correlated with high and 
      durable protection. However, large cohort and longitudinal studies are required 
      for the evaluation of immunity dynamics and longevity in unvaccinated, 
      vaccinated, and infected individuals, as well as vaccinated convalescent 
      individuals in real-world settings. Regarding the likelihood of vaccine escape 
      variants evolving, an ongoing examination of the protection conferred against an 
      evolving virus (new variant) by an extended schedule can be crucial.

      Effectiveness among Hospitalized Italian Adults, 2021/22 Season.

AB  - Following an extremely low incidence of influenza during the first waves of the 
      ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021/22 Northern Hemisphere winter season saw a 
      resurgence of influenza virus circulation. The aim of this study was to describe 
      epidemiology of severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) among Italian adults 
      and estimate the 2021/22 season influenza vaccine effectiveness. For this 
      purpose, a test-negative case-control study was conducted in a geographically 
      representative sample of Italian hospitals. Of 753 SARI patients analyzed, 2.5% 
      (N = 19) tested positive for influenza, most of which belonged to the A(H3N2) 
      subtype. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these belonged to the subclade 
      3C.2a1b.2a.2, which was antigenically different from the 2021/22 A(H3N2) vaccine 
      component. Most (89.5%) cases were registered among non-vaccinated individuals, 
      suggesting a protective effect of influenza vaccination. Due to a limited number 
      of cases, vaccine effectiveness estimated through the Firth's penalized logistic 
      regression was highly imprecise, being 83.4% (95% CI: 25.8-97.4%) and 83.1% (95% 
      CI: 22.2-97.3%) against any influenza type A and A(H3N2), respectively. Exclusion 
      of SARS-CoV-2-positive controls from the model did not significantly change the 
      base-case estimates. Within the study limitations, influenza vaccination appeared 
      to be effective against laboratory-confirmed SARI.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The impact of COVID-19 infection and the effect of 
      COVID-19 vaccinations on patients with demyelinating central nervous system 
      disease in low middle income countries (LMIC's) have not been reported in detail 
      earlier. We sought to identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 infection 
      and the role of vaccination in order to develop management guidelines relevant to 
      our patients. METHODS: A total of 621 patients from our registry that included 
      297 MS and 324 non MS disorders (Aquaporin- 4 antibody positive [50], Myelin 
      oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody positive [81], seronegative [162] and 
      clinically isolated syndrome [31]) were contacted. COVID-19 infection and 
      vaccination status were queried. Patients who self reported COVID-19 infection 
      based on a positive RT PCR report were compared with non infected patients to 
      identify factors associated with susceptibility for COVID-19 infection. 
      Univariate and multivariate analysis of potential risk factors included 
      demographic and clinical features, body mass index (BMI), presence of 
      comorbidities, absolute lymphocyte count, treatment types and vaccination status. 
      RESULTS: Sixty seven patients with MS and 27 with non MS disorders developed 
      COVID-19 infection. Among them 81 patients had mild infection and remained 
      quarantined at home. All 13 patients who needed hospitalization recovered. 
      Vaccination status was known in 582 patients among whom 69.8% had completed or 
      taken one dose of vaccine at the time of inquiry. Majority of treated patients 
      (61.3%) were on nonspecific immunosuppressants. In univariate analysis, presence 
      of ≥1 comorbidity was significantly associated with COVID-19 infection in both MS 
      (p value 0.01, OR-2.28, 95%CI- 1.18-4.4) and non MS patients (p- 0.001, OR-4.4, 
      95% CI-1.88-10.24). In the latter, BMI ≥ 30 (p-0.04, OR-3.27, 95% CI- 0.98-10.87) 
      and EDSS score ≥ 3 (p-0.02, OR- 2.59,95% CI- 1.08-6.23) were other significant 
      associations. History of prior COVID-19 vaccination was associated with reduced 
      frequency of COVID-19 infection among MS (p- 0.001,OR- 0.24,95% CI- 0.13-0.43) 
      and non MS patients (p- 0.0001,OR-0.14, 95% CI- 0.058-0.35). In multivariate 
      analysis presence of comorbidities significantly increased and prior vaccination 
      significantly reduced frequency of COVID-19 infection for both MS and related 
      disorders. Concurrent disease modifying treatments showed a trend for association 
      with infection. In the unvaccinated group, patients on disease modifying 
      treatment were significantly at risk of infection, 81.5% unvaccinated and treated 
      versus 18.5% who were unvaccinated and untreated (p- 0.0001, OR-10.1, 95% 
      CI-0.56-2.11). CONCLUSION: Frequency and severity of COVID-19 infection was low 
      among our patient cohort. Higher rate of infection in the treated group was 
      significantly seen among unvaccinated patients. Our preliminary results suggests 
      that in LMIC's, where "off label therapies" with inexpensive immunosuppressives 
      are the main disease modifying drugs, mRNA vaccinations appear safe and effective 
      against severe COVID-19 infection.

TI  - Case-control study to estimate odds of death within 28 days of positive test for 
      SARS-CoV-2 prior to vaccination for residents of long-term care facilities in 
      England, 2020-2021.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Persons living in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are presumed to 
      be at higher risk of adverse outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection due to increasing 
      age and frailty, but the magnitude of increased risk is not well quantified. 
      METHODS: After linking demographic and mortality data for cases with confirmed 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 2020 and January 2021 in England, a random 
      sample of 6000 persons who died and 36 000 who did not die within 28 days of a 
      positive test was obtained from the dataset of 3 020 800 patients. Based on an 
      address-matching process, the residence type of each case was categorised into 
      one of private home and residential or nursing LTCF. Univariable and 
      multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Multivariable 
      analysis showed that an interaction effect between age and residence type 
      determined the outcome. Compared with a 60-year-old person not living in LTCF, 
      the adjusted OR (aOR) for same-aged persons living in residential and nursing 
      LTCFs was 1.77 (95% CI 1.21 to 2.6, p=0.0017) and 3.95 (95% CI 2.77 to 5.64, 
      p<0.0001), respectively. At 90 years of age, aORs were 0.87 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.06, 
      p=0.21) and 0.74 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.9, p=0.001), respectively. The model had an 
      overall accuracy of 94.2% (94.2%) when applied to the full dataset of 2 978 800 
      patients. CONCLUSION: This study found that residents of LTCFs in England had 
      higher odds of death up to 80 years of age. Beyond 80 years, there was no 
      difference in the odds of death for LTCF residents compared with those in the 
      wider community.

TI  - Evaluation of BNT162b2 Vaccine Effectiveness in Galicia, Northwest Spain.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19074039 [doi]
LID - 4039
AB  - Investigating vaccine effectiveness (VE) in real-world conditions is crucial, 
      especially its variation across different settings and populations. We undertook 
      a test-negative control study in Galicia (Northwest Spain) to assess BNT162b2 
      effectiveness against acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      infection as well as COVID-19 associated hospitalization, intensive care unit 
      (ICU) admission and mortality. A total of 44,401 positive and 817,025 negative 
      SARS-CoV-2 test results belonging to adults were included. Adjusted odds ratios 
      of vaccination and their 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using 
      multivariate logistic-regression models. BNT162b2 showed high effectiveness in 
      reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections in all age categories, reaching maximum VE ≥ 14 
      days after administering the second dose [18-64 years: VE = 92.9% (95%CI: 
      90.2-95.1); 65-79 years: VE = 85.8% (95%CI: 77.3-91.9), and ≥80 years: VE = 91.4% 
      (95%CI: 87.9-94.1)]. BNT162b2 also demonstrated effectiveness in preventing 
      COVID-19 hospitalization for all age categories, with VE more pronounced for 
      those aged ≥80 years [VE = 60.0% (95%CI: 49.4-68.3)]. Moreover, there was a 
      considerable reduction in ICU admission [VE = 88.0% (95%CI: 74.6-95.8)] and 
      mortality [VE = 38.0% (95%CI: 15.9-55.4)] in the overall population. BNT162b2 
      showed substantial protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 
      severity. Our findings would prove useful for systematic reviews and 
      meta-analysis on COVID-19 VE.

TI  - Evaluation of the Effectiveness and Safety of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccine in 
      the Vaccination Campaign among the Health Workers of Fondazione Policlinico 
      Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph182111098 [doi]

AB  - Health workers, especially those in patient-facing roles, had a significantly 
      increased risk of COVID-19 infection, having serious outcomes, and risking 
      spreading the virus to patients and staff. Vaccination campaign planning suggests 
      allocating initial supplies of BNT162b2 vaccine to health workers given the 
      importance of early protection to safeguard the continuity of care to patients. 
      The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of BNT162b2 
      vaccine among the health workers of Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino 
      Gemelli IRCCS (FPG). The retrospective cohort study was conducted among health 
      staff working at the FPG. Vaccination data were collected from hospital records. 
      The primary end points were vaccine effectiveness and safety. A total of 6649 
      health workers were included, of whom 5162 received injections. There were 14 
      cases of COVID-19 with onset at least 14 days after the second dose among 
      vaccinated health workers and 45 cases among unvaccinated ones. BNT162b2 was 
      91.5% effective against COVID-19 (95% credible interval, 84.7% to 95.3%). The 
      safety profile of BNT162b2 vaccine consisted of short-term, non-serious events. 
      The promotion and boost of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign represents a key 
      public health measure useful to curb the spread of the pandemic especially in 
      vulnerable contexts, such as hospitals, where health workers carry out a 
      paramount role for the entire community, and requires further protection with a 
      possible booster dose in view of autumn-winter 2021.

      BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine.
PG  - 179-184
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.7382 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: With the evidence of waning immunity of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 
      (Pfizer-BioNTech), a nationwide third-dose (booster) vaccination campaign was 
      initiated in Israel during August 2021; other countries have begun to administer 
      a booster shot as well. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the initial short-term additional 
      benefit of a 3-dose vs a 2-dose regimen against infection of SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This preliminary retrospective case-control study used 
      2 complementary approaches: a test-negative design and a matched case-control 
      design. Participants were included from the national centralized database of 
      Maccabi Healthcare Services, an Israeli healthcare maintenance organization 
      covering 2.5 million members. Data were collected between March 1, 2020, and 
      October 4, 2021, and analyses focused on the period from August 1, 2021, to 
      October 4, 2021, because the booster dose was widely administered from August 1 
      onward. EXPOSURES: Either 2 doses or 3 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The reduction in the odds of a positive SARS-CoV-2 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at different time intervals following 
      receipt of the booster dose (0-6, 7-13, 14-20, 21-27, and 28-65 days) compared 
      with receiving only 2 doses. RESULTS: The study population included 306 710 
      members of Maccabi Healthcare Services who were 40 years and older (55% female) 
      and received either 2 or 3 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine and did not have a 
      positive PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2 prior to the start of the follow-up 
      period. During this period, there were 500 232 PCR tests performed, 227 380 among 
      those who received 2 doses and 272 852 among those who received 3 doses, with 
      14 989 (6.6%) and 4941 (1.8%) positive test results in each group, respectively. 
      Comparing those who received a booster and those who received 2 doses, there was 
      an estimated odds ratio of 0.14 (95% CI, 0.13-0.15) 28 to 65 days following 
      receipt of the booster (86% reduction in the odds of testing positive for 
      SARS-CoV-2). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Previous studies have demonstrated that 
      vaccine-derived protection against SARS-CoV-2 wanes over time. In this 
      case-control analysis, we showed an association between receipt of the booster 
      dose and a reduction in the odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, potentially 
      counteracting waning immunity in the short term. Further monitoring of data from 
      this population is needed to determine the duration of immunity following the 
      booster.

AB  - The duration of protection of the third (booster) dose of the BioNTech/Pfizer 
      BNT162b2 mRNA Coronavirus Disease 2019 vaccine has been the subject of recent 
      investigations, as global discussions around the necessity and effectiveness of a 
      fourth dose are already underway. By conducting a retrospective study 
      implementing a test-negative case-control design, analyzing 546,924 PCR tests 
      performed throughout January 2022 by 389,265 persons who received at least two 
      doses, we find that the effectiveness in each month-since-vaccination decreases 
      significantly. Compared to those vaccinated five months prior to the outcome 
      period, on August 2021, relative protection against infection waned from 53.4% a 
      month after vaccination to 16.5% three months after vaccination. These results 
      suggest that there is a significant waning of vaccine effectiveness against the 
      Omicron variant of the third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine within a few months 
      after administration. Additional information could assist to comprehensively 
      estimate the effectiveness of the three-dose-strategy.

AB  - Background: Epidemiological studies show that BCG-vaccinated population seems to 
      be more likely protected from COVID-19 infection, but WHO gave a stark warning on 
      use of BCG vaccine without confirmed COVID-19 trials. The aim of the study is to 
      evaluate whether TB vaccination, performed several years earlier, could confer 
      protection against COVID-19. Methods: After the Ethical Committee authorization, 
      professional orders were used to contact physicians with an online survey. 
      Specialty, COVID-19 infection and previous BCG vaccination were recorded. 
      Statistical data analysis was performed. Results: 1906 physicians answered the 
      questionnaire, (M = 1068; F = 838; mean age 50.7 ± 13.3 years; range 24-87), more 
      than half (1062; 55.7%) experienced BCG vaccination. Professional activity was 
      recorded, and only 49 subjects (2.6%) of them were infected by SARS-CoV2. Among 
      the group of infected people, asymptomatic form occurred in 12 subjects (24.5%); 
      a pauci-symptomatic form in 24 subjects (49.0%); and a severe form (pneumonia 
      and/or respiratory distress) in 13 (26.5%). Considering only the clinically 
      relevant form of COVID-19, period prevalence was 2.2% (23/1062) in the vaccinated 
      group and 1.7% (14/844) in the unvaccinated group (OR: 1.31, 95% C.I.: 0.68-2.63, 
      p = 0.427). Conclusion: Our experience does not confirm the possible protective 
      role of BCG vaccination, performed years earlier, against COVID-19. Although 
      recent epidemiological studies point out in BCG-vaccinated population a lower 
      prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infection, in our cohort of physicians no significant 
      difference was found in terms of prevalence of COVID-19 infection. Our data 
      underline the necessity to follow the WHO warning about the indiscriminate use of 
      BCG vaccine, until clear evidence of protection by BCG vaccination against 
      COVID-19 is fully demonstrated.

TI  - Comparison of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children-Related Myocarditis, 
      Classic Viral Myocarditis, and COVID-19 Vaccine-Related Myocarditis in Children.
PG  - e024393

AB  - Background Although rare, classic viral myocarditis in the pediatric population 
      is a disease that carries significant morbidity and mortality. Since 2020, 
      myocarditis has been a common component of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in 
      children (MIS-C) following SARS-CoV-2 infection. In 2021, myocarditis related to 
      mRNA COVID-19 vaccines was recognized as a rare adverse event. This study aims to 
      compare classic, MIS-C, and COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis with regard to 
      clinical presentation, course, and outcomes. Methods and Results In this 
      retrospective cohort study, we compared patients aged <21 years hospitalized at 
      our institution with classic viral myocarditis from 2015 to 2019, MIS-C 
      myocarditis from March 2020 to February 2021, and vaccine-related myocarditis 
      from May 2021 to June 2021. Of 201 total participants, 43 patients had classic 
      myocarditis, 149 had MIS-C myocarditis, and 9 had vaccine-related myocarditis. At 
      presentation, ejection fraction was lowest for those with classic myocarditis, 
      with ejection fraction <55% present in 58% of patients. Nearly all patients with 
      MIS-C myocarditis (n=139, 93%) and all patients with vaccine-related myocarditis 
      (n=9, 100%) had normal left ventricular ejection fraction at the time of 
      discharge compared with 70% (n=30) of the classic myocarditis group (P<0.001). At 
      3 months after discharge, of the 21 children discharged with depressed ejection 
      fraction, none of the 10 children with MIS-C myocarditis had residual dysfunction 
      compared with 3 of the 11 (27%) patients in the classic myocarditis group. 
      Conclusions Compared with classic myocarditis, those with MIS-C myocarditis had 
      better clinical outcomes, including rapid recovery of cardiac function. Patients 
      with vaccine-related myocarditis had prompt resolution of symptoms and 
      improvement of cardiac function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In February 2021, Colombia began mass vaccination against COVID-19 
      using mainly BNT162b2 and CoronaVac vaccines. We aimed to estimate vaccine 
      effectiveness (VE) to prevent COVID-19 symptomatic cases, hospitalization, 
      critical care admission, and deaths in a cohort of 796,072 insured subjects older 
      than 40 years in northern Colombia, a setting with a high SARS-CoV-2 
      transmission. METHODS: We identified individuals vaccinated between March 1st of 
      2021 and August 15th of 2021. We included symptomatic cases, hospitalizations, 
      critical care admissions, and deaths in patients with confirmed COVID-19 as main 
      outcomes. We calculated VE for each outcome from the hazard ratio in Cox 
      proportionally hazards regressions (adjusted by age, sex, place of residence, 
      diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus, cancer, hypertension, tuberculosis, 
      neurological diseases, and chronic renal disease), with 95% confidence intervals 
      (CI). FINDINGS: A total of 719,735 insured participants of 40 and more years were 
      followed. We found 21,545 laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 among 
      unvaccinated population, along with 2874 hospitalizations, 1061 critical care 
      admissions, and 1329 deaths, for a rate of 207.2 per million person-days, 27.1 
      per million person-days, 10.0 per million person-days, and 12.5 per million 
      person-days, respectively. We found CoronaVac was not effective for any outcome 
      in subjects above 80 years old; but for people 40-79 years of age, we found two 
      doses of CoronaVac reduced hospitalization (33.1%; 95% CI, 14.5-47.7), critical 
      care admission (47.2%; 95% CI, 18.5-65.8), and death (55.7%; 95% CI, 32.5-70.0). 
      We found BNT162b2 was effective for all outcomes in the entire population of 
      subjects above 40 years of age, significantly declining for subjects ≥80 years. 
      INTERPRETATION: Two doses of either CoronaVac in population between 40 and 79 
      years of age, or BNT162b2 among vaccinated above 40 years old significantly 
      reduced deaths of confirmed COVID-19 in a cohort of individuals from Colombia. 
      Vaccine effectiveness for CoronaVac and BNT162b2 declined with increasing age.

PG  - 1680-1689
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2109908 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) is a 
      new syndrome associated with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 adenoviral vector vaccine 
      against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Data are lacking on the 
      clinical features of and the prognostic criteria for this disorder. METHODS: We 
      conducted a prospective cohort study involving patients with suspected VITT who 
      presented to hospitals in the United Kingdom between March 22 and June 6, 2021. 
      Data were collected with the use of an anonymized electronic form, and cases were 
      identified as definite or probable VITT according to prespecified criteria. 
      Baseline characteristics and clinicopathological features of the patients, risk 
      factors, treatment, and markers of poor prognosis were determined. RESULTS: Among 
      294 patients who were evaluated, we identified 170 definite and 50 probable cases 
      of VITT. All the patients had received the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine 
      and presented 5 to 48 days (median, 14) after vaccination. The age range was 18 
      to 79 years (median, 48), with no sex preponderance and no identifiable medical 
      risk factors. Overall mortality was 22%. The odds of death increased by a factor 
      of 2.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 5.2) among patients with cerebral 
      venous sinus thrombosis, by a factor of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.3) for every 50% 
      decrease in the baseline platelet count, by a factor of 1.2 (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.3) 
      for every increase of 10,000 fibrinogen-equivalent units in the baseline d-dimer 
      level, and by a factor of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.5) for every 50% decrease in the 
      baseline fibrinogen level. Multivariate analysis identified the baseline platelet 
      count and the presence of intracranial hemorrhage as being independently 
      associated with death; the observed mortality was 73% among patients with 
      platelet counts below 30,000 per cubic millimeter and intracranial hemorrhage. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The high mortality associated with VITT was highest among patients 
      with a low platelet count and intracranial hemorrhage. Treatment remains 
      uncertain, but identification of prognostic markers may help guide effective 
      management. (Funded by the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.).

AB  - Vaccination programs against COVID-19 vary globally with estimates of vaccine 
      effectiveness (VE) affected by vaccine type, schedule, strain, outcome, and 
      recipient characteristics. This study assessed VE of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 
      vaccines against PCR positive SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospital admission, and death 
      among adults aged 50 years and older in Wales, UK during the period 7 December 
      2020 to 18 July 2021, when Alpha, followed by Delta, were the predominant 
      variants. We used individual-level linked routinely collected data within the 
      Secure Anonymized Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. Data were available for 
      1,262,689 adults aged 50 years and over; coverage of one dose of any COVID-19 
      vaccine in this population was 92.6%, with coverage of two doses 90.4%. VE 
      against PCR positive infection at 28-days or more post first dose of any COVID-19 
      vaccine was 16.0% (95%CI 9.6-22.0), and 42.0% (95%CI 36.5-47.1) seven or more 
      days after a second dose. VE against hospital admission was higher at 72.9% 
      (95%CI 63.6-79.8) 28 days or more post vaccination with one dose of any vaccine 
      type, and 84.9% (95%CI 78.2-89.5) at 7 or more days post two doses. VE for one 
      dose against death was estimated to be 80.9% (95%CI 72.1-86.9). VE against PCR 
      positive infection and hospital admission was higher for BNT162b2 compared to 
      ChAdOx1. In conclusion, vaccine uptake has been high among adults in Wales and VE 
      estimates are encouraging, with two doses providing considerable protection 
      against severe outcomes. Continued roll-out of the vaccination programme within 
      Wales, and globally, is crucial in our fight against COVID-19.

TI  - Association of COVID-19 Vaccination With Risk of COVID-19 Infection, 
      Hospitalization, and Death in Heart Transplant Recipients.
PG  - 651-654
LID - 10.1001/jamacardio.2022.0670 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients are at increased risk 
      for morbidity and mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although antibody 
      response to COVID-19 vaccination is lower in solid organ transplant recipients, 
      there has been no study assessing the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 
      vaccination in OHT recipients. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and effectiveness 
      of COVID-19 vaccination and associations with SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical 
      outcomes in a large population of adult OHT recipients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This case-control study examined data from a US heart transplant 
      program at a single center for all adult recipients of OHT who were followed up 
      from January 15, 2021, through January 31, 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The 
      primary outcome was number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and related hospitalizations, 
      intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths between vaccinated vs 
      unvaccinated adult recipients of OHT. RESULTS: A total of 436 patients who 
      received OHT were included in the study, of which 106 patients were infected with 
      COVID-19. The mean (SD) age was 54 (17) years; 303 (69.5%) were men and 133 
      (30.5%) were women. There were 366 patients in the vaccinated cohort with 72 
      COVID-19 infections (19.7%), 15 hospitalizations (4.1%), 4 ICU admissions (1.1%), 
      and 3 deaths (0.8%). There were 70 patients in the unvaccinated cohort with 34 
      COVID-19 infections (48.6%), 10 hospitalizations (14.3%), 3 ICU admissions 
      (4.3%), and 3 deaths (4.3%). COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a lower 
      risk of COVID-19 infection (risk ratio [RR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.30-0.56), 
      hospitalization (RR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.14-0.61), and death (RR, 0.19; 95% CI, 
      0.05-0.82). Among the 366 vaccinated OHT recipients, there was no 
      echocardiographic evidence of graft dysfunction, clinically significant 
      rejection, or allosensitization at 6 months after they received the COVID-19 
      vaccine. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients with OHT who are infected with 
      SARS-CoV-2 are at greater risk of severe infection and death compared with 
      immunocompetent individuals. COVID-19 vaccination was associated with fewer 
      COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, with no heart 
      transplant-specific adverse events. COVID-19 vaccination for all OHT recipients 
      is of paramount importance.

      crucial to gain an insight into the longer-term impact on health outcomes, and 
      eventually boosting public confidence. For this reason, we conducted a 
      multicenter, retrospective cohort study using data on infection and vaccination 
      rates among employees of three Prague hospitals in the period between 27 December 
      2020 and 31 August 2021. The post-vaccination and post-infection protectiveness 
      were assessed in a total of 11,443 hospital workers who were followed up for more 
      than 14 days either after their Comirnaty vaccination or study enrolment, 
      depending on their previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The effectiveness of full 
      vaccination against any SARS-CoV-2 infection achieved 88.3% (83.2-91.8%) over the 
      eight months of follow-up, a figure not much different from the 92.5% 
      (76.5-97.6%) level of protection built by a previous infection. Despite this, the 
      post-vaccination level of protection declined to about 65% between June and 
      August. No case of breakthrough infection was registered among hospital workers 
      having received one or two vaccine doses more than three months after previous 
      infection. The eight-month effectiveness of the Comirnaty vaccine exhibited a 
      declining trend requiring a new booster dose. The need for vaccination in the 
      previously infected employees was not demonstrated conclusively in this study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 infection in pregnant people has previously been shown to 
      increase the risk for poor maternal-fetal outcomes. Despite this, there has been 
      a lag in COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant people due to concerns over the 
      potential effects of the vaccine on maternal-fetal outcomes. Here we examine the 
      impact of COVID-19 vaccination and booster on maternal COVID-19 breakthrough 
      infections and birth outcomes. METHODS: This was a retrospective multicenter 
      cohort study on the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on maternal-fetal outcomes for 
      people that delivered (n=86,833) at Providence St. Joseph Health across Alaska, 
      California, Montana, Oregon, New Mexico, Texas, and Washington from January 26, 
      2021 through July 11, 2022. Cohorts were defined by vaccination status at time of 
      delivery: unvaccinated (n=48,492), unvaccinated propensity score matched 
      (n=26,790), vaccinated (n=26,792; two doses of mRNA-1273 Moderna or BNT162b2 
      Pfizer-BioNTech), and/or boosted (n=7,616). The primary outcome was maternal 
      COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 vaccination status at delivery, COVID-19 
      infection-related health care, preterm birth (PTB), stillbirth, very low birth 
      weight (VLBW), and small for gestational age (SGA) were evaluated as secondary 
      outcomes. FINDINGS: Vaccinated pregnant people were significantly less likely to 
      have a maternal COVID-19 infection than unvaccinated matched (p<0.0001) pregnant 
      people. During a maternal COVID-19 infection, vaccinated pregnant people had 
      similar rates of hospitalization (p=0.23), but lower rates of supplemental oxygen 
      (p<0.05) or vasopressor (p<0.05) use than those in an unvaccinated matched 
      cohort. Compared to an unvaccinated matched cohort, vaccinated people had 
      significantly lower stillbirth rate (p<0.01) as well as no difference in rate of 
      PTB (p=0.35), SGA (p=0.79), or rate of VLBW (>1,500 g; 0.31). Vaccinated people 
      who were boosted had significantly lower rates of maternal COVID-19 infections 
      (p<0.0001), COVID-19 related hospitalization (p<0.05), PTB (p<0.05), stillbirth 
      (p<0.01), SGA (p<0.05), and VLBW (p<0.01), compared to vaccinated people that did 
      not receive a third booster dose five months after completing the initial 
      vaccination series. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 vaccination protects against adverse 
      maternal-fetal outcomes with booster doses conferring additional protection 
      against COVID-19 infection. It is therefore important for pregnant people to have 
      high priority status for vaccination, and for them to stay current with their 
      COVID-19 vaccination schedule. FUNDING: This study was funded by the National 
      Institute for Child Health & Human Development and the William O. and K. Carole 
      Ellison Foundation.

TI  - Associations of BMI with COVID-19 vaccine uptake, vaccine effectiveness, and risk 
      of severe COVID-19 outcomes after vaccination in England: a population-based 
      cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A high BMI has been associated with a reduced immune response to 
      vaccination against influenza. We aimed to investigate the association between 
      BMI and COVID-19 vaccine uptake, vaccine effectiveness, and risk of severe 
      COVID-19 outcomes after vaccination by using a large, representative 
      population-based cohort from England. METHODS: In this population-based cohort 
      study, we used the QResearch database of general practice records and included 
      patients aged 18 years or older who were registered at a practice that was part 
      of the database in England between Dec 8, 2020 (date of the first vaccination in 
      the UK), to Nov 17, 2021, with available data on BMI. Uptake was calculated as 
      the proportion of people with zero, one, two, or three doses of the vaccine 
      across BMI categories. Effectiveness was assessed through a nested matched 
      case-control design to estimate odds ratios (OR) for severe COVID-19 outcomes 
      (ie, admission to hospital or death) in people who had been vaccinated versus 
      those who had not, considering vaccine dose and time periods since vaccination. 
      Vaccine effectiveness against infection with SARS-CoV-2 was also investigated. 
      Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models estimated the risk of severe 
      COVID-19 outcomes associated with BMI (reference BMI 23 kg/m(2)) after 
      vaccination. FINDINGS: Among 9 171 524 participants (mean age 52 [SD 19] years; 
      BMI 26·7 [5·6] kg/m(2)), 566 461 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during follow-up, 
      of whom 32 808 were admitted to hospital and 14 389 died. Of the total study 
      sample, 19·2% (1 758 689) were unvaccinated, 3·1% (287 246) had one vaccine dose, 
      52·6% (4 828 327) had two doses, and 25·0% (2 297 262) had three doses. In people 
      aged 40 years and older, uptake of two or three vaccine doses was more than 80% 
      among people with overweight or obesity, which was slightly lower in people with 
      underweight (70-83%). Although significant heterogeneity was found across BMI 
      groups, protection against severe COVID-19 disease (comparing people who were 
      vaccinated vs those who were not) was high after 14 days or more from the second 
      dose for hospital admission (underweight: OR 0·51 [95% CI 0·41-0·63]; healthy 
      weight: 0·34 [0·32-0·36]; overweight: 0·32 [0·30-0·34]; and obesity: 0·32 
      [0·30-0·34]) and death (underweight: 0·60 [0·36-0·98]; healthy weight: 0·39 
      [0·33-0·47]; overweight: 0·30 [0·25-0·35]; and obesity: 0·26 [0·22-0·30]). In the 
      vaccinated cohort, there were significant linear associations between BMI and 
      COVID-19 hospitalisation and death after the first dose, and J-shaped 
      associations after the second dose. INTERPRETATION: Using BMI categories, there 
      is evidence of protection against severe COVID-19 in people with overweight or 
      obesity who have been vaccinated, which was of a similar magnitude to that of 
      people of healthy weight. Vaccine effectiveness was slightly lower in people with 
      underweight, in whom vaccine uptake was also the lowest for all ages. In the 
      vaccinated cohort, there were increased risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes for 
      people with underweight or obesity compared with the vaccinated population with a 
      healthy weight. These results suggest the need for targeted efforts to increase 
      uptake in people with low BMI (<18·5 kg/m(2)), in whom uptake is lower and 
      vaccine effectiveness seems to be reduced. Strategies to achieve and maintain a 
      healthy weight should be prioritised at the population level, which could help 
      reduce the burden of COVID-19 disease. FUNDING: UK Research and Innovation and

AB  - Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, health care personnel (HCP) have been at high 
      risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, through patient 
      interactions and community exposure (1). The Advisory Committee on Immunization 
      Practices recommended prioritization of HCP for COVID-19 vaccination to maintain 
      provision of critical services and reduce spread of infection in health care 
      settings (2). Early distribution of two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech 
      and Moderna) to HCP allowed assessment of the effectiveness of these vaccines in 
      a real-world setting. A test-negative case-control study is underway to evaluate 
      mRNA COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic illness among HCP at 
      33 U.S. sites across 25 U.S. states. Interim analyses indicated that the VE of a 
      single dose (measured 14 days after the first dose through 6 days after the 
      second dose) was 82% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 74%-87%), adjusted for age, 
      race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions. The adjusted VE of 2 doses 
      (measured ≥7 days after the second dose) was 94% (95% CI = 87%-97%). VE of 
      partial (1-dose) and complete (2-dose) vaccination in this population is 
      comparable to that reported from clinical trials and recent observational 
      studies, supporting the effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines against 
      symptomatic disease in adults, with strong 2-dose protection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prioritization of U.S. health care personnel for early receipt of 
      messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 
      (Covid-19), allowed for the evaluation of the effectiveness of these new vaccines 
      in a real-world setting. METHODS: We conducted a test-negative case-control study 
      involving health care personnel across 25 U.S. states. Cases were defined on the 
      basis of a positive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) or antigen-based test for 
      SARS-CoV-2 and at least one Covid-19-like symptom. Controls were defined on the 
      basis of a negative PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, regardless of symptoms, and were 
      matched to cases according to the week of the test date and site. Using 
      conditional logistic regression with adjustment for age, race and ethnic group, 
      underlying conditions, and exposures to persons with Covid-19, we estimated 
      vaccine effectiveness for partial vaccination (assessed 14 days after receipt of 
      the first dose through 6 days after receipt of the second dose) and complete 
      vaccination (assessed ≥7 days after receipt of the second dose). RESULTS: The 
      study included 1482 case participants and 3449 control participants. Vaccine 
      effectiveness for partial vaccination was 77.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
      70.9 to 82.7) with the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) and 88.9% (95% CI, 78.7 
      to 94.2) with the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna); for complete vaccination, vaccine 
      effectiveness was 88.8% (95% CI, 84.6 to 91.8) and 96.3% (95% CI, 91.3 to 98.4), 
      respectively. Vaccine effectiveness was similar in subgroups defined according to 
      age (<50 years or ≥50 years), race and ethnic group, presence of underlying 
      conditions, and level of patient contact. Estimates of vaccine effectiveness were 
      lower during weeks 9 through 14 than during weeks 3 through 8 after receipt of 
      the second dose, but confidence intervals overlapped widely. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines were highly effective under real-world conditions 
      in preventing symptomatic Covid-19 in health care personnel, including those at 
      risk for severe Covid-19 and those in racial and ethnic groups that have been 
      disproportionately affected by the pandemic. (Funded by the Centers for Disease 
      Control and Prevention.).

TI  - Effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccination in Preventing COVID-19-Associated 
      Hospitalization Among Adults with Previous SARS-CoV-2 Infection - United States, 
      June 2021-February 2022.
PG  - 549-555
LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm7115e2 [doi]
AB  - Previous infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been 
      estimated to confer up to 90% protection against reinfection, although this 
      protection was lower against the Omicron variant compared with that against other 
      SARS-CoV-2 variants (1-3). A test-negative design was used to estimate 
      effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in preventing subsequent 
      COVID-19-associated hospitalization among adults aged ≥18 years with a previous 
      positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) or diagnosis of COVID-19.(†) The 
      analysis used data from Cosmos, an electronic health record (EHR)-aggregated data 
      set (4), and compared vaccination status of 3,761 case-patients (positive NAAT 
      result associated with hospitalization) with 7,522 matched control-patients 
      (negative NAAT result). After previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, estimated vaccine 
      effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19-associated hospitalization was 47.5% (95% 
      CI = 38.8%-54.9%) after 2 vaccine doses and 57.8% (95% CI = 32.1%-73.8%) after a 
      booster dose during the Delta-predominant period (June 20-December 18, 2021), and 
      34.6% (95% CI = 25.5%-42.5%) after 2 doses and 67.6% (95% CI = 61.4%-72.8%) after 
      a booster dose during the Omicron-predominant period (December 19, 2021-February 
      24, 2022). Vaccination provides protection against COVID-19-associated 
      hospitalization among adults with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the highest 
      level of protection conferred by a booster dose. All eligible persons, including 
      those with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, should stay up to date with vaccination 
      to prevent COVID-19-associated hospitalization.

TI  - Durability of the Single-Dose Ad26.COV2.S Vaccine in the Prevention of COVID-19 
      Infections and Hospitalizations in the US Before and During the Delta Variant 
      Surge.
PG  - e222959

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is critical to control the 
      pandemic. Randomized clinical trials demonstrated efficacy of the single-dose 
      Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine, but data on longer-term protection in clinical 
      practice and effectiveness against variants are needed. OBJECTIVE: To assess the 
      association between receiving the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and COVID-19-related 
      infections and hospitalizations before and during the Delta variant surge. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included adults aged 18 
      years and older who were newly Ad26.COV2.S-vaccinated matched to as many as 10 
      unvaccinated individuals by date, location, age, sex, and comorbidity index. This 
      was followed by 1:4 propensity score matching on COVID-19 risk factors. Data were 
      collected from US insurance claims data from March 1, 2020, through August 31, 
      2021. EXPOSURES: Vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S vs no vaccination. MAIN OUTCOMES 
      AND MEASURES: Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated for recorded COVID-19 
      infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization, nationwide and in subgroups by 
      age, high-risk factors, calendar time, and states with high incidences of the 
      Delta variant. VE estimates were corrected for underrecording of vaccinations in 
      insurance data. RESULTS: Among 422 034 vaccinated individuals (mean [SD] age, 
      54.7 [17.4] years; 236 437 [56.0%] women) and 1 645 397 matched unvaccinated 
      individuals (mean [SD] age, 54.5 [17.5] years; 922 937 [56.1%] women), VE was 76% 
      (95% CI, 75%-77%) for COVID-19 infections and 81% (95% CI, 78%-82%) for 
      COVID-19-related hospitalizations. VE was stable for at least 180 days after 
      vaccination and over calendar time. Among states with high Delta variant 
      incidence, VE during June to August 2021 was 74% (95% CI, 71%-77%) for infections 
      and 81% (95% CI, 75%-86%) for hospitalizations. VE for COVID-19 was higher in 
      individuals younger than 65 years (78%; 95% CI, 77%-79%) and lower in 
      immunocompromised patients (64%; 95% CI, 59%-68%). All estimates were corrected 
      for vaccination underrecording; uncorrected VE, which served as a lower bound, 
      was 66% (95% CI, 64%-67%) for any recorded COVID-19 infection and 72% (95% CI, 
      69%-74%) for COVID-19-related hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This 
      cohort study in US clinical practice showed stable VE of Ad26.COV2.S for at least 
      6 months before as well as during the time the Delta variant emerged and became 
      dominant.

TI  - Post-Vaccination SARS-CoV-2 Infections among Health Workers at the University 
      Hospital of Verona, Italy: A Retrospective Cohort Survey.
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10020272 [doi]
LID - 272
AB  - BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign began on 27 December 2020 in 
      Europe, primarily involving health workers. This study aimed to assess the 
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccination effectiveness, as assessed by reductions in incidence, 
      symptom severity, and further infection spreading. METHODS: A retrospective 
      cohort study was conducted on 9811 health workers operating at the Verona 
      University Hospital, Italy, from 27 December 2020 to 3 May 2021. All health 
      workers were offered vaccination with Comirnaty (BNT162b2, BioNTech/Pfizer, 
      Mainz, Germany/New York, United States), and a health surveillance program was 
      implemented with periodical swab testing. Vaccination status and clinical data 
      were collected using an ad hoc semi-structured questionnaire and health 
      surveillance charts. RESULTS: As of 3rd of May, 82.5% of health workers had been 
      vaccinated against SAR-CoV-2, and 177 (1.8%) had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 
      Vaccination more than halved the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
      reduced by two-thirds the cumulative incidence of symptomatic subjects. In 
      detail, most unvaccinated HWs were symptomatic; 50% reported fever, 45% reported 
      ageusia/anosmia, and nearly 20% reported dyspnea. These percentages were much 
      lower in HWs who had been vaccinated for at least 14 days (18% for fever and 
      anosmia, 6% for dyspnea and ageusia). Moreover, cases of vaccine breakthrough 
      were sixfold less likely to further spread the infection than unvaccinated HWs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination reduced the infection frequency among HWs, 
      further spreading of the infection, and the presence, severity, and duration of 
      COVID-19-related symptoms.

AB  - Recently, Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness has decreased especially against mild 
      disease due to emergence of the Delta variant and waning protection. In this 
      register-based study among healthcare workers in Finland, the vaccine 
      effectiveness of two-dose mRNA vaccine series against SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      decreased from 82% (95% CI 79-85%) 14-90 days after vaccination to 53% (43-62%) 
      after 6 months. Similar trend was observed for other series. Waning was not 
      observed against Covid-19 hospitalization. These results facilitate 
      decision-making of booster doses for healthcare workers.

      (B.1.1.529) BA.1 and BA.2 SARS-CoV-2 variants after previous infection and 
      vaccination in adolescents in England, August, 2021-March, 2022: a national, 
      observational, test-negative, case-control study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      following previous infection with specific individual SARS-CoV-2 variants, 
      COVID-19 vaccination, and a combination of previous infection and vaccination 
      (hybrid immunity) in adolescents. We aimed to estimate protection against 
      symptomatic PCR-confirmed infection with the delta (B.1.617.2) and omicron 
      (B.1.1.529) variants in adolescents with previous infection, mRNA vaccination, 
      and hybrid immunity. METHODS: We conducted an observational, test-negative, 
      case-control study using national SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-19 mRNA 
      vaccination data in England. Symptomatic adolescents aged 12-17 years who were 
      unvaccinated or had received primary BNT162b2 immunisation at symptom onset and 
      had a community SARS-CoV-2 PCR test were included. Vaccination and previous 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection status in adolescents with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (cases) 
      were compared with vaccination and previous infection status in adolescents who 
      had a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test (controls). Vaccination data were collected 
      from the National Immunisation Management System, and were linked to PCR testing 
      data. The primary outcome was protection against SARS-CoV-2 delta and omicron 
      infection (defined as 1 - odds of vaccination or previous infection in cases 
      divided by odds of vaccination or previous infection in controls). FINDINGS: 
      Between Aug 9, 2021, and March 31, 2022, 1 161 704 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were 
      linked to COVID-19 vaccination status, including 390 467 positive tests with the 
      delta variant and 212 433 positive tests with the omicron variants BA.1 and BA.2. 
      In unvaccinated adolescents, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection with wildtype, alpha 
      (B.1.1.7), or delta strains provided greater protection against subsequent delta 
      infection (>86·1%) than against subsequent omicron infection (<52·4%); previous 
      delta or omicron infection provided similar protection against omicron 
      reinfection (52·4% [95% CI 50·9-53·8] vs 59·3% [46·7-69·0]). In adolescents with 
      no previous infection, vaccination provided lower protection against omicron 
      infection than against delta infection, with omicron protection peaking at 64·5% 
      (95% CI 63·6-65·4) at 2-14 weeks after dose two and 62·9% (60·5-65·1) at 2-14 
      weeks after dose three, with waning protection after each dose. Adolescents with 
      hybrid immunity from previous infection and vaccination had the highest 
      protection, irrespective of the SARS-CoV-2 strain in the primary infection. The 
      highest protection against omicron infection was observed in adolescents with 
      vaccination and previous omicron infection, reaching 96·4% (95% CI 84·4-99·1) at 
      15-24 weeks after vaccine dose two. INTERPRETATION: Previous infection with any 
      SARS-CoV-2 variant provided some protection against symptomatic reinfection, and 
      vaccination added to this protection. Vaccination provides low-to-moderate 
      protection against symptomatic omicron infection, with waning protection after 
      each dose, while hybrid immunity provided the most robust protection. Although 
      more data are needed to investigate longer-term protection and protection against 
      infection with new variants, these data question the need for additional booster 
      vaccine doses for adolescents in populations with already high protection against 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. FUNDING: None.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed at assessing the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 
      Covishield, which is identical to AstraZeneca vaccine, in preventing 
      laboratory-confirmed Covid-19. METHODS: Using test-negative case-control design, 
      information on vaccination status of cases with Covid-19 among healthcare workers 
      in our institution in Puducherry, India, and an equal number of controls matched 
      for age and date of testing, was obtained. The groups were compared using 
      multivariable conditional logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR). VE 
      was calculated as 100*(1-adjusted odds ratio)%. RESULTS: Using data from 360 
      case-control pairs, VE of one dose and of two doses, in providing protection 
      against Covid-19 was 49% (95% CI: 17%-68%) and 54% (27%-71%), respectively. Among 
      cases with moderately severe disease that required oxygen therapy, VE following 
      any number of vaccine doses was 95% (44%-100%). CONCLUSION: Covishield vaccine 
      protected significantly against Covid-19, with a higher protection rate against 
      severe forms of disease.

TI  - COVID-19 Vaccination and Asymptomatic Infection: Effect of BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine 
      on the Incidence of COVID-19 and Duration of Sick Leave Among Healthcare Workers.
PG  - e868-e870
LID - 10.1097/JOM.0000000000002389 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of COVID-19 and the duration of sick leave 
      among asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) after vaccination with BNT162b2. 
      METHODS: From October 2020 to March 2021, we determined the incidence of COVID-19 
      in a cohort of 671 asymptomatic HCWs before and after the vaccination. We also 
      analyzed the days required to obtain a negative RT-PCR result after infection. 
      RESULTS: Prior to vaccination 105 (15.6%) HCWs were positive. Positive cases were 
      reduced to 42 (7.5%) after the vaccination period (P < 0.0001). A negative RT-PCR 
      was observed at the first control in 80% of vaccinated HCWs and only in 37% 
      before vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Even in case of asymptomatic infection, 
      vaccinated HCWs have a reduced incidence and a shorter period of sick leave than 
      before vaccination, suggesting vaccination impacts on the sustainability of the 
      health system and labor costs.

TI  - Waning Effectiveness of the BNT162b2 Vaccine Against Infection in Adolescents.
LID - 2022.01.04.22268776 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2022.01.04.22268776 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The short-term effectiveness of a two-dose regimen of the 
      BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine for adolescents has been demonstrated. 
      However, little is known about the long-term effectiveness in this age group. It 
      is known, though, that waning of vaccine-induced immunity against infection in 
      adult populations is evident within a few months. METHODS: Leveraging the 
      centralized computerized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), we 
      conducted a matched case-control design for evaluating the association between 
      time since vaccination and the incidence of infections, where two outcomes were 
      evaluated separately: a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection (regardless of symptoms) 
      and a symptomatic infection (COVID-19). Cases were defined as individuals aged 12 
      to 16 with a positive PCR test occurring between June 15 and December 8, 2021, 
      when the Delta variant was dominant in Israel. Controls were adolescents who had 
      not tested positive previously. RESULTS: We estimated a peak vaccine 
      effectiveness between 2 weeks and 3 months following receipt of the second dose, 
      with 85% and 90% effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, 
      respectively. However, in line with previous findings for adults, waning of 
      vaccine effectiveness was evident in adolescents as well. Long-term protection 
      conferred by the vaccine was reduced to 75-78% against infection and symptomatic 
      infection, respectively, 3 to 5 months after the second dose, and waned to 58% 
      against infection and 65% against COVID-19 after 5 months. CONCLUSIONS: Like 
      adults, vaccine-induced protection against both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 
      wanes with time, starting three months after inoculation and continuing for more 
      than five months.

AB  - COVID-19 vaccines are effective, but breakthrough infections have been 
      increasingly reported. We conducted a test-negative case-control study to assess 
      the durability of protection after full vaccination with BNT162b2 against 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a 
      national medical practice from January 2021 through January 2022. We fit 
      conditional logistic regression (CLR) models stratified on residential county and 
      calendar time of testing to assess the association between time elapsed since 
      vaccination and the odds of symptomatic infection or non-COVID-19 hospitalization 
      (negative control), adjusted for several covariates. There were 5,985 symptomatic 
      individuals with a positive test after full vaccination with BNT162b2 (cases) and 
      32,728 negative tests contributed by 27,753 symptomatic individuals after full 
      vaccination (controls). The adjusted odds of symptomatic infection were higher 
      250 days after full vaccination versus at the date of full vaccination (Odds 
      Ratio [OR]: 3.62, 95% CI: 2.52 to 5.20). The odds of infection were still lower 
      285 days after the first BNT162b2 dose as compared to 4 days after the first dose 
      (OR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.67), when immune protection approximates the 
      unvaccinated status. Low rates of COVID-19 associated hospitalization or death in 
      this cohort precluded analyses of these severe outcomes. The odds of non-COVID-19 
      associated hospitalization (negative control) decreased with time since 
      vaccination, suggesting a possible underestimation of waning protection by this 
      approach due to confounding factors. In summary, BNT162b2 strongly protected 
      against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection for at least 8 months after full 
      vaccination, but the degree of protection waned significantly over this period.

AB  - COVID-19 vaccines are effective, but breakthrough infections have been 
      increasingly reported. We conducted a test-negative case-control study to assess 
      the durability of protection against symptomatic infection after vaccination with 
      mRNA-1273. We fit conditional logistic regression (CLR) models stratified on 
      residential county and calendar date of SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing to assess the 
      association between the time elapsed since vaccination and the odds of 
      symptomatic infection, adjusted for several covariates. There were 2,364 
      symptomatic individuals who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test after full 
      vaccination with mRNA-1273 ("cases") and 12,949 symptomatic individuals who 
      contributed 15,087 negative tests after full vaccination ("controls"). The odds 
      of symptomatic infection were significantly higher 250 days after full 
      vaccination compared to the date of full vaccination (Odds Ratio [OR]: 2.47, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-5.13). The odds of non-COVID-19 associated 
      hospitalization and non-COVID-19 pneumonia (negative control outcomes) remained 
      relatively stable over the same time interval (Day 250 OR(Non-COVID 
      Hospitalization): 0.68, 95% CI: 0.47-1.0; Day 250 OR(Non-COVID Pneumonia): 1.11, 
      95% CI: 0.24-5.2). The odds of symptomatic infection remained significantly lower 
      almost 300 days after the first mRNA-1273 dose as compared to 4 days after the 
      first dose, when immune protection approximates the unvaccinated state (OR: 0.26, 
      95% CI: 0.17-0.39). Low rates of COVID-19 associated hospitalization or death in 
      this cohort precluded analyses of these severe outcomes. In summary, mRNA-1273 
      robustly protected against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at least 8 months 
      after full vaccination, but the degree of protection waned over this time period.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We explored the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing 
      reinfection in the Republic of Cyprus. STUDY DESIGN: This was a matched 
      case-control study (1:2). METHODS: Cases were adults with a first episode of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in 2020 and a second episode (i.e. reinfection) between June 
      and August 2021. Controls were adults with only one infection episode in 2020 
      (i.e. not reinfected). Matching was performed by age, gender, and week of 
      diagnosis for the first episode. The reinfection date of a case was applied to 
      the matched controls for estimating full or partial vaccination status. Cases and 
      controls were classified as unvaccinated, partially vaccinated (i.e. vaccination 
      series not completed or final dose received ≤14 days before the reinfection 
      date), or fully vaccinated (i.e. final dose received >14 days before the 
      reinfection date). Conditional logistic regression was performed to calculate 
      odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for full or partial vaccination, against 
      no vaccination, between controls and cases. RESULTS: This study showed that 
      controls were more likely to be vaccinated (odds ratio for full vaccination: 
      5.51, 95% confidence interval: 2.43-12.49) than cases. CONCLUSIONS: This finding 
      answers a pressing question of the public and supports the offer of vaccination 
      to people with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.

TI  - Impact of cytokine storm on severity of COVID-19 disease in a private hospital in 
      West Jakarta prior to vaccination.
PG  - e0262438

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide 
      pandemic and is a threat to global health. Patients who experienced cytokine 
      storms tend to have a high mortality rate. However, to date, no study has 
      investigated the impact of cytokine storms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 
      retrospective cohort study included only COVID-19 positive patients hospitalized 
      in a Private Hospital in West Jakarta between March and September 2020. All 
      patients were not vaccinated during this period and treatment was based on the 
      guidelines by the Ministry of Health Indonesia. A convenience sampling method was 
      used and all patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. RESULTS: The 
      clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients following medical therapy was either cured 
      (85.7%) or died (14.3%), with 14.3% patients reported to have cytokine storm, 
      from which 23.1% led to fatalities. A plasma immunoglobulin (Gammaraas®) and/or 
      tocilizumab (interleukin-6 receptor antagonist; Actemra®) injection was utilised 
      to treat the cytokine storm while remdesivir and oseltamivir were administered to 
      ameliorate COVID-19. Most (61.5%) patients who experienced the cytokine storm 
      were male; mean age 60 years. Interestingly, all patients who experienced the 
      cytokine storm had hypertension or/ and diabetes complication (100%). Fever, 
      cough and shortness of breath were also the common symptoms (100.0%). Almost all 
      (92.3%) patients with cytokine storm had to be treated in the intensive care unit 
      (ICU). Most (76.9%) patients who had cytokine storm received hydroxychloroquine 
      and all had antibiotics [1) azithromycin + levofloxacin or 2) meropenam for 
      critically ill patients] and vitamins such as vitamins C and B-complex as well as 
      mineral. Unfortunately, from this group, 23.1% patients died while the remaining 
      70% of patients recovered. A significant (p<0.05) correlation was established 
      between cytokine storms and age, the presence of comorbidity, diabetes, 
      hypertension, fever, shortness of breath, having oxygen saturation (SPO2) less 
      than 93%, cold, fatigue, ward of admission, the severity of COVID-19 disease, 
      duration of treatment as well as the use of remdesivir, Actemra® and Gammaraas®. 
      Most patients recovered after receiving a combination treatment (oseltamivir + 
      remdesivir + Antibiotics + Vitamin/Mineral) for approximately 11 days with a 90% 
      survival rate. On the contrary, patients who received oseltamivir + 
      hydroxychloroquine + Gammaraas® + antibiotics +Vitamin/Mineral, had a 83% 
      survival rate after being admitted to the hospital for about ten days. 
      CONCLUSION: Factors influencing the development of a cytokine storm include age, 
      duration of treatment, comorbidity, symptoms, type of admission ward and severity 
      of infection. Most patients (76.92%) with cytokine storm who received 
      Gammaraas®/Actemra®, survived although they were in the severe and critical 
      levels (87.17%). Overall, based on the treatment duration and survival rate, the 
      most effective therapy was a combination of oseltamivir + favipiravir + 
      hydroxychloroquine + antibiotics + vitamins/minerals.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate vaccine effectiveness after the first and second dose of 
      ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 against symptomatic COVID-19 and infection in a socially 
      vulnerable community in Brazil when Gamma and Delta were the predominant variants 
      circulating. METHODS: We conducted a test-negative study in the community 
      Complexo da Maré, the largest group of slums (n = 16) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 
      from January 17, 2021 to November 27, 2021. We selected RT-qPCR positive and 
      negative tests from a broad community testing program. The primary outcome was 
      symptomatic COVID-19 (positive RT-qPCR test with at least one symptom) and the 
      secondary outcome was infection (any positive RT-qPCR test). Vaccine 
      effectiveness was estimated as 1 - OR, which was obtained from adjusted logistic 
      regression models. RESULTS: We included 10 077 RT-qPCR tests (6,394, 64% from 
      symptomatic and 3,683, 36% from asymptomatic individuals). The mean age was 40 
      (SD: 14) years, and the median time between vaccination and RT-qPCR testing among 
      vaccinated was 41 (25-75 percentile: 21-62) days for the first dose and 36 (25-75 
      percentile: 17-59) days for the second dose. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness 
      against symptomatic COVID-19 was 31.6% (95% CI, 12.0-46.8) 21 days after the 
      first dose and 65.1% (95% CI, 40.9-79.4) 14 days after the second dose. Adjusted 
      vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 infection was 31.0% (95% CI, 12.7-45.5) 
      21 days after the first dose and 59.0% (95% CI, 33.1-74.8) 14 days after the 
      second dose. DISCUSSION: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was effective in reducing symptomatic 
      COVID-19 in a socially vulnerable community in Brazil when Gamma and Delta were 
      the predominant variants circulating.

AB  - The effectiveness of inactivated vaccines (VE) against symptomatic and severe 
      COVID-19 caused by omicron is unknown. We conducted a nationwide, test-negative, 
      case-control study to estimate VE for homologous and heterologous (BNT162b2) 
      booster doses in adults who received two doses of CoronaVac in Brazil in the 
      Omicron context. Analyzing 1,386,544 matched-pairs, VE against symptomatic 
      disease was 8.6% (95% CI, 5.6-11.5) and 56.8% (95% CI, 56.3-57.3) in the period 
      8-59 days after receiving a homologous and heterologous booster, respectively. 
      During the same interval, VE against severe Covid-19 was 73.6% (95% CI, 
      63.9-80.7) and 86.0% (95% CI, 84.5-87.4) after receiving a homologous and 
      heterologous booster, respectively. Waning against severe Covid-19 after 120 days 
      was only observed after a homologous booster. Heterologous booster might be 
      preferable to individuals with completed primary series inactivated vaccine.

TI  - Decreased infectivity following BNT162b2 vaccination: A prospective cohort study 
      in Israel.
PG  - 100150

LID - 100150
AB  - BACKGROUND: BNT162b2 was shown to be 92% effective in preventing COVID-19. 
      Prioritizing vaccine rollout, and achievement of herd immunity depend on 
      SARS-CoV-2 transmission reduction. The vaccine's effect on infectivity is thus a 
      critical priority. METHODS: Among all 9650 HCW of a large tertiary medical center 
      in Israel, we calculated the prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR cases with 
      asymptomatic presentation, tested following known or presumed exposure and the 
      infectious subset (N-gene-Ct-value<30) of these. Additionally, infection 
      incidence rates were calculated for symptomatic cases and infectious (Ct<30) 
      cases. Vaccine effectiveness within three months of vaccine rollout was measured 
      as one minus the relative risk or rate ratio, respectively. To further assess 
      infectiousness, we compared the mean Ct-value and the proportion of infections 
      with a positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen test of vaccinated vs. unvaccinated. The 
      correlation between IgG levels within the week before detection and Ct level was 
      assessed. FINDINGS: Reduced prevalence among fully vaccinated HCW was observed 
      for (i) infections detected due to exposure, with asymptomatic presentation 
      (VE(i)=65.1%, 95%CI 45-79%), (ii) the presumed infectious (Ct<30) subset of these 
      (VE(ii)=69.6%, 95%CI 43-84%) (iii) never-symptomatic infections (VE(iii)=72.3%, 
      95%CI 48-86%), and (iv) the presumed infectious (Ct<30) subset (VE(iv)=83.0%, 
      95%CI 51-94%).Incidence of (v) symptomatic and (vi) symptomatic-infectious cases 
      was significantly lower among fully vaccinated vs. unvaccinated individuals 
      (VE(v)= 89.7%, 95%CI 84-94%, VE(vi)=88.1%, 95%CI 80-95%).The mean Ct-value was 
      significantly higher in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated (27.3±1.2 vs. 22.2±1.0, 
      p<0.001) and the proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests was also 
      significantly lower among vaccinated vs. unvaccinated PCR-positive HCW (80% vs. 
      31%, p<0.001). Lower infectivity was correlated with higher IgG concentrations 
      (R=0.36, p=0.01). INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that BNT162b2 is 
      moderately to highly effective in reducing infectivity, via preventing infection 
      and through reducing viral shedding. FUNDING: Sheba Medical Center, Israel.

TI  - Evaluating real-world COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness using a test-negative 
      case-control design.

LID - 10.2217/cer-2022-0069 [doi]
AB  - Aim: It is important to assess if clinical trial efficacy translates into 
      real-world effectiveness for COVID-19 vaccines. Materials & methods: We conducted 
      a modified test-negative design (TND) to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of 
      three COVID-19 vaccines. We defined cases in two ways: 
      self-reported COVID-19-positive tests, and self-reported positive tests with ≥1 
      moderate/severe COVID-19 symptom. Results: Any vaccination was associated with a 
      95% reduction in subsequently reporting a positive COVID-19 test, and a 71% 
      reduction in reporting a positive test and ≥1 moderate/severe symptom. 
      Conclusion: We observed high effectiveness across all three marketed vaccines, 
      both for self-reported positive COVID-19 tests and moderate/severe COVID-19 
      symptoms. This innovative TND approach can be implemented in future COVID-19 
      vaccine and treatment real-world effectiveness studies.

TI  - Vaccine Effectiveness of CanSino (Adv5-nCoV) Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      Vaccine Among Childcare Workers-Mexico, March-December 2021.
PG  - S167-S173
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac488 [doi]
LID - ciac488
AB  - BACKGROUND: Beginning in March 2021, Mexico vaccinated childcare workers with a 
      single-dose CanSino Biologics (Adv5-nCoV) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      vaccine. Although CanSino is currently approved for use in 10 Latin American, 
      Asian, and European countries, little information is available about its vaccine 
      effectiveness (VE). METHODS: We evaluated CanSino VE within a childcare worker 
      cohort that included 1408 childcare facilities. Participants were followed during 
      March-December 2021 and tested through severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction or 
      rapid antigen test if they developed any symptom compatible with COVID-19. 
      Vaccination status was obtained through worker registries. VE was calculated as 
      100% × (1 - hazard ratio for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated vs 
      unvaccinated participants), using an Andersen-Gill model adjusted for age, sex, 
      state, and local viral circulation. RESULTS: The cohort included 43 925 persons 
      who were mostly (96%) female with a median age of 32 years; 37 646 (86%) were 
      vaccinated with CanSino. During March-December 2021, 2250 (5%) participants had 
      laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, of whom 25 were hospitalized and 6 died. Adjusted 
      VE was 20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10%-29%) against illness, 76% (95% CI, 
      42%-90%) against hospitalization, and 94% (95% CI, 66%-99%) against death. VE 
      against illness declined from 48% (95% CI, 33%-61%) after 14-60 days following 
      full vaccination to 20% (95% CI, 9%-31%) after 61-120 days. CONCLUSIONS: CanSino 
      vaccine was effective at preventing COVID-19 illness and highly effective at 
      preventing hospitalization and death. It will be useful to further evaluate 
      duration of protection and assess the value of booster doses to prevent COVID-19 
      and severe outcomes.

TI  - Impaired humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine in kidney transplant 
      recipients and dialysis patients.
LID - eabj1031 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/sciimmunol.abj1031 [doi]
AB  - Patients with kidney failure are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      making effective vaccinations a critical need. It is not known how well mRNA 
      vaccines induce B and plasma cell responses in dialysis patients (DP) or kidney 
      transplant recipients (KTR) compared to healthy controls (HC). We studied humoral 
      and B cell responses of 35 HC, 44 DP and 40 KTR. Markedly impaired anti-BNT162b2 
      responses were identified among KTR and DP compared to HC. In DP, the response 
      was delayed (3-4 weeks after boost) and reduced with anti-S1 IgG and IgA 
      positivity in 70.5% and 68.2%, respectively. In contrast, KTR did not develop IgG 
      responses except one patient who had a prior unrecognized infection and developed 
      anti-S1 IgG. The majority of antigen-specific B cells (RBD+) were identified in 
      the plasmablast or post-switch memory B cell compartments in HC, whereas RBD+ B 
      cells were enriched among pre-switch and naïve B cells from DP and KTR. The 
      frequency and absolute number of antigen-specific circulating plasmablasts in the 
      cohort correlated with the Ig response, a characteristic not reported for other 
      vaccinations. In conclusion, these data indicated that immunosuppression resulted 
      in impaired protective immunity after mRNA vaccination, including Ig induction 
      with corresponding generation of plasmablasts and memory B cells. Thus, there is 
      an urgent need to improve vaccination protocols in patients after kidney 
      transplantation or on chronic dialysis.

TI  - COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against omicron (B.1.1.529) variant infection and 
      hospitalisation in patients taking immunosuppressive medications: a retrospective 
      cohort study.
PG  - e775-e784
LID - 10.1016/S2665-9913(22)00216-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a scarcity of research regarding the effectiveness of the 
      mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccines in patients 
      taking immunosuppressant medications, and no data are published to date 
      pertaining to their effectiveness against omicron (B.1.1.529) variant SARS-CoV-2 
      infection and hospitalisation. We aimed to assess the relationship between 
      immunosuppressive medications, mRNA vaccination, omicron infection, and severe 
      COVID-19 outcomes (ie, hospitalisation, ICU admission, death). METHODS: We did a 
      retrospective cohort study and included vaccinated and unvaccinated people aged 
      18 years or older in the Michigan Medicine health-care system, USA, during the 
      omicron-dominant period of the pandemic (Dec 16, 2021-March 4, 2022). We 
      collected data from electronic health records (demographics, diagnoses, 
      medications) combined with immunisation data from the Michigan State Registry to 
      determine vaccination status, and we collected COVID-19-related hospitalisation 
      data by chart review. We used a Cox proportional hazards model based on calendar 
      time to assess the effectiveness of the mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccines in people 
      taking immunosuppressive medications (conventional synthetic disease-modifying 
      antirheumatic drugs [DMARDs], biologic DMARDs, or glucocorticoids within the past 
      3 months), while controlling for participant characteristics. Using the same 
      model, we assessed the effect of different classes of medication such as 
      immunosuppressive DMARDs, immunomodulatory DMARDs, and glucocorticoids on 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalisation due to COVID-19. All analyses were done 
      using complete cases after removing participants with missing covariates. 
      FINDINGS: 209 492 people were identified in Michigan Medicine, including 165 913 
      who were vaccinated and 43 579 who were unvaccinated. 41 078 people were excluded 
      because they were younger than 18 years, partially vaccinated, had received a 
      vaccine other than the two vaccines studied, or had incomplete covariate data. 
      168 414 people were included in the analysis; 97 935 (58%) were women, 70 479 
      (42%) were men, and 129 816 (77%) were White. 5609 (3%) people were taking 
      immunosuppressive medications. In patients receiving immunosuppressants, three 
      doses of BNT162b2 had a vaccine effectiveness of 50% (95% CI 31-64; p<0·0001) and 
      three doses of mRNA-1273 had a vaccine effectiveness of 60% (42-73; p<0·0001) 
      against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Three doses of either vaccine had an effectiveness 
      of 87% (95% CI 73-93; p<0·0001) against hospitalisation due to COVID-19. Receipt 
      of immunosuppressive DMARDs (hazard ratio 2·32, 95% CI 1·23-4·38; p=0·0097) or 
      glucocorticoids (2·93, 1·77-4·86; p<0·0001) and a history of organ or bone marrow 
      transplantation (3·52, 2·01-6·16; p<0·0001) were associated with increased risk 
      of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 compared with those who had not received 
      immunosuppressive medications or transplant. INTERPRETATION: People taking 
      immunosuppressive DMARDs or glucocorticoids are at substantially higher risk of 
      hospitalisation due to COVID-19 than the general population. However, the 
      mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccines remain effective within this group, and it is 
      important that patients taking these medications remain up to date with 
      vaccinations to mitigate their risk. FUNDING: National Institute of Allergy and 
      Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health.

AB  - PURPOSE: The BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) is approved for adolescents aged 12-17 
      years. We estimated BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness (VE) and a booster dose 
      effectiveness in adolescents aged 12-17 years and the impact of opening schools 
      and the Omicron variant on risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adolescents. METHODS: 
      We used logistic regression with a test-negative design controlling for gender 
      and race to estimate BNT162b2 VE and the effectiveness of a booster dose in 
      adolescents aged 12-17 years. To evaluate the effect of school opening on Omicron 
      transmission, we used Cox proportional hazards regression to compare adolescents 
      to a reference group of adults aged 22-33 or aged 65+ years, investigating 
      whether risk for adolescents increased relative to the reference group after 
      school opened. RESULTS: We found that adolescents who received two BNT162b2 doses 
      had significant protection against Omicron infection in the first three months 
      following their second dose (VE = 54.5%, confidence interval [CI]: [17.8%-76.9%], 
      p = .014) but no protection afterwards. Receiving a booster dose was associated 
      with lower risk of infection (odds ratio = 0.48, CI: [0.33-0.69], p < .0001) and 
      restored efficacy to a similar level (VE = 56.3%, CI: [36.5%-70.6%], p < .0001). 
      We observed a statistically significant increase (p = .04) in adolescent 
      infection risk relative to adults in the period of Omicron predominance. 
      DISCUSSION: The BNT162b2 vaccine is effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      in adolescents but immunity against Omicron wanes rapidly and booster doses are 
      needed to retain protection. More research is needed to determine the effect of 
      school reopening on spread in the Omicron-dominant period.

TI  - Association between COVID-19 Primary Vaccination and Severe Disease Caused by

      Cohort Study.
LID - 10.3390/vaccines11010014 [doi]
LID - 14
AB  - We aimed to investigate vaccine effectiveness against progression to severe 
      COVID-19 (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), intensive care unit (ICU) 
      admission and/or death) and in-hospital death in a cohort of hospitalized 
      COVID-19 patients. Mixed effects logistic regression analyses were performed to 
      estimate the association between receiving a primary COVID-19 vaccination 
      schedule and severe outcomes after adjusting for patient, hospital, and 
      vaccination characteristics. Additionally, the effects of the vaccine brands 
      including mRNA vaccines mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2, and adenovirus-vector vaccines 
      ChAdOx1 (AZ) and Ad26.COV2.S (J&J) were compared to each other. This 
      retrospective, multicenter cohort study included 2493 COVID-19 patients 
      hospitalized across 73 acute care hospitals in Belgium during the time period 15 
      August 2021-14 November 2021 when the Delta variant (B1.617.2) was predominant. 
      Hospitalized COVID-19 patients that received a primary vaccination schedule had 
      lower odds of progressing to severe disease (OR (95% CI); 0.48 (0.38; 0.60)) and 
      in-hospital death (OR (95% CI); 0.49 (0.36; 0.65)) than unvaccinated patients. 
      Among the vaccinated patients older than 75 years, mRNA vaccines and AZ seemed to 
      confer similar protection, while one dose of J&J showed lower protection in this 
      age category. In conclusion, a primary vaccination schedule protects against 
      worsening of COVID-19 to severe outcomes among hospitalized patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe effectiveness of mRNA vaccines by comparing 2-dose (2D) 
      and 3-dose (3D) healthcare worker (HCW) recipients in the setting of Omicron 
      variant dominance. Performance of 2D and 3D vaccine series against SARS-CoV-2 
      variants and the clinical outcomes of HCWs may inform return-to-work guidance. 
      METHODS: In a retrospective study from December 15, 2020 to January 15, 2022, 
      SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCWs at a large tertiary cancer centre in New York 
      City were examined to estimate infection rates (aggregated positive tests / 
      person-days) and 95% CIs over the Omicron period in 3D and 2D mRNA vaccinated 
      HCWs and were compared using rate ratios. We described the clinical features of 
      post-vaccine infections and impact of prior (pre-Omicron) COVID infection on 
      vaccine effectiveness. RESULTS: Among the 20857 HCWs in our cohort, 20,660 
      completed the 2D series with an mRNA vaccine during our study period and 12461 
      had received a third dose by January 15, 2022. The infection rate ratio for 3D 
      versus 2D vaccinated HCWs was 0.667 (95% CI 0.623, 0.713) for an estimated 3D 
      vaccine effectiveness of 33.3% compared to two doses only during the Omicron 
      dominant period from December 15, 2021 to January 15, 2022. Breakthrough Omicron 
      infections after 3D + 14 days occurred in 1,315 HCWs. Omicron infections were 
      mild, with 16% of 3D and 11% 2D HCWs being asymptomatic. DISCUSSION: Study 
      demonstrates improved vaccine-derived protection against COVID-19 infection in 3D 
      versus 2D mRNA vaccinees during the Omicron surge. The advantage of 3D 
      vaccination was maintained irrespective of prior COVID-19 infection status.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Breastfeeding women are generally excluded from 
      clinical trials with new vaccines. The objective of the study was to explore 
      whether the BNT162b2 mRNA and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines are safe for 
      breastfeeding mothers and their breastfed infants. Methods: A convenience sample 
      prospective cohort single institution study was performed on breastfeeding health 
      care professionals, who were exposed to second dose of SARS-CoV2 vaccine at the 
      beginning of the study period. They and their breastfed children's symptoms were 
      followed up through online questionnaires for 14 days. Results: Of the 95 finally 
      included participants, only 1 was lost to follow-up on day 7. Mean age of the 
      mothers was 35.9 ± 3.9 years and that of their infants was 14.6 ± 12.1 months. At 
      least one adverse event was reported by 85% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
      76-91.5%) of the mothers. The most frequent was injection site pain in 81% of 
      cases. Moreover, 31% (95% CI: 22-41%) observed some event in their breastfed 
      children. Most frequently, 19% (95% CI: 13-30%) of the children were irritable. 
      During the 14 days of follow-up, 36% of the children (95% CI: 27-46%) were 
      diagnosed with respiratory infection. Conclusions: Most mothers' reactions were 
      mild and transitory, generally limited to the first 3 days after vaccination. 
      Many children's events were associated with concomitant infectious processes and 
      we did not detect a notable peak on any particular day of follow-up. Neither 
      mothers nor their infants developed serious adverse events nor were they 
      diagnosed with COVID-19 within the study period.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence from COVID-19 outbreak shows that individuals with specific 
      chronic diseases are at higher risk of severe prognosis after infection. Public 
      health authorities are developing vaccination programmes with priorities that 
      minimize the risk of mortality and severe events in individuals and communities. 
      We propose an evidence-based strategy that targets the frailest subjects whose 
      timely vaccination is likely to minimize future deaths and preserve the 
      resilience of the health service by preventing infections. METHODS: The cohort 
      includes 146,087 cases with COVID-19 diagnosed in 2020 in Milan (3.49 million 
      inhabitants). Individual level data on 42 chronic diseases and vital status 
      updated as of January 21, 2021, were available in administrative data. Analyses 
      were performed in three sub-cohorts of age (16-64, 65-79 and 80+ years) and 
      comorbidities affecting mortality were selected by means of LASSO cross-validated 
      conditional logistic regression. Simplified models based on previous results 
      identified high-risk categories worth targeting with highest priority. Results 
      adjusted by age and gender, were reported in terms of odds ratios and 95%CI. 
      RESULTS: The final models include as predictors of mortality (7,667 deaths, 5.2%) 
      10, 12, and 5 chronic diseases, respectively. The older age categories shared, as 
      risk factors, chronic renal failure, chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular 
      disease, Parkinson disease and psychiatric diseases. In the younger age category, 
      predictors included neoplasm, organ transplantation and psychiatric conditions. 
      Results were consistent with those obtained on mortality at 60 days from 
      diagnosis (6,968 deaths). CONCLUSION: This approach defines a two-level 
      stratification for priorities in the vaccination that can easily be applied by 
      health authorities, eventually adapted to local results in terms of number and 
      types of comorbidities, and rapidly updated with current data. After the early 
      phase of vaccination, data on effectiveness and safety will give the opportunity 
      to revise prioritization and discuss the future approach in the remaining 
      population.

LID - 10.19191/EP22.1.A001.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after the second vaccine 
      dose decline in the following months; the administration of an additional vaccine 
      dose (booster) is able to restore the immune system in the short period 
      significantly reducing the risk of a severe disease. In the winter of 2021, a new 
      particularly infectious variant caused the urgent need to increase the coverage 
      of the booster dose. OBJECTIVES: to present, using real data, an evaluation of 
      the efficacy of the booster dose in reducing the severe disease of SARS-CoV-2 
      infection in terms of hospital admissions, intensive care and death from all 
      causes. DESIGN: descriptive study of vaccine adherence; associative study of the 
      factors linked with adherence of vaccination and COVID-19 symptoms; associative 
      study of vaccine effectiveness against hospital admission and mortality. SETTING 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: population-based study in the Milan and Lodi provinces 
      (Lombardy Region, Northern Italy) with subjects aged >=19 years alive at 
      01.10.2021, not residing in a nursery home, followed up to 31.12.2021. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: COVID-19 symptoms, hospitalization for COVID-19, intensive care 
      hospitalization, and all-cause mortality in the period 01.10.2021-31.12.2021. 
      RESULTS: the cohort included 2,936,193 patients at 01.10.2021: at the end of the 
      follow-up period (31.12.2021), 378,616 (12.9%) had no vaccine, 128,879 (4.3%) had 
      only 1 dose, 412,227 (14.0%) had a 2nd dose given since less than 4 months, 725. 
      806 (25%) had a 2nd dose given since 4-7 months, 74,152 (2.5%) had a 2nd dose 
      given since 7+ months, 62,614 (2.1%) had a 2nd dose and have had the disease, and 
      1,153,899 (39.3%) received the booster. In the study period 
      (01.10.2021-31.12.2021), characterized by a very high prevalence of the omicron 
      variant, 121,620 cases (antigenic/molecular buffer positive), 3,661 
      hospitalizations for COVID-19, 162 ICU hospitalizations, and 7,508 deaths from 
      all causes were identified. Compared to unvaccinated people, subjects who had the 
      booster dose had half the risk of being symptomatic, in particular for asthenia, 
      muscle pain, and dyspnoea which are the most commons COVID-19 symptoms. In 
      comparison with the subjects who had the booster dose, the unvaccinated had a 
      10-fold risk of hospitalization for COVID-19, a 9-fold risk of intensive care, 
      and a 3-fold risk of dying. CONCLUSIONS: this work highlights the vaccination 
      efficacy in reducing serious adverse events for those who undergo the booster and 
      the need to implement specific engagement policies to bring to a booster those 
      who had taken the second dose since the longest time.

AB  - A retrospective cohort study was carried out in a large Israeli health 
      maintenance organization to determine vaccine effectiveness (VE) of a third dose 
      of BNT162b2 vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Of nearly 1 million members receiving 2 doses of BNT162b2 
      in January-February 2021, infection rates (based on polymerase chain reaction 
      results) were compared between those who received a third dose with those who did 
      not during August-October 2021 (maximum, 70 days). Crude VE was 92.9% (95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 92.6%-93.2%) and adjusted VE was 89.1% (95% CI, 
      87.5%-90.5%). We conclude that the third dose provides added protection against 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection for those vaccinated 6 months ago.

AB  - Development of an effective vaccine against Covid-19 is crucial to reducing 
      infection. mRNA BNT162b2, developed and manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech, was one 
      of the first FDA-approved vaccinations reporting high efficacy (95%) and minimal 
      side effects. Evaluating effectiveness of BNT162b2 in a general population has 
      been made possible after the implementation of a nation-wide vaccination program 
      in Israel. This retrospective cohort study was carried out in Maccabi HealthCare 
      services, Israel among 1.6 million members aged 16 and over. The population was 
      divided into those who were at least seven days post- second vaccination and 
      those who had not been vaccinated. Number of days till the end of the study or 
      Covid-19 infection, Covid-19-related hospitalization and mortality was calculated 
      for each participant between 18.1.2021 to 25.4.2021. Participants who had reached 
      day eight after second vaccination during the study period could contribute days 
      to both groups. Vaccine efficacy (VE) was calculated using a conditional Poisson 
      model, controlling for age group, gender, hypertension, diabetes and obesity, 
      fitted within clusters defined by geographical statistical area and calendar 
      week. BNT162b2 was found effective for the total population group for infection, 
      hospitalization and mortality, with adjusted VE of 93·0% (CI:92·6-93·4%), 93·4% 
      (CI:91·9-94·7%) and 91·1% (CI:86·5-94·1%) respectively. VE for infection was 
      lower for participants aged 75 and over, and for those with hypertension, 
      diabetes and obesity. This study strengthens the evidence that the 
      Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination is effective in preventing infection, hospitalization 
      and mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant individuals have been receiving COVID-19 vaccines following 
      pre-authorisation clinical trials in non-pregnant people. This study aimed to 
      determine the frequency and nature of significant health events among pregnant 
      females after COVID-19 vaccination, compared with unvaccinated pregnant controls 
      and vaccinated non-pregnant individuals. METHODS: We did an observational cohort 
      study, set in seven Canadian provinces and territories including Ontario, Quebec, 
      British Columbia, Alberta, Nova Scotia, Yukon, and Prince Edward Island. 
      Eligibility criteria for vaccinated individuals were a first dose of a COVID-19 
      vaccine within the previous 7 days; an active email address and telephone number; 
      ability to communicate in English or French; and residence in the aforementioned 
      provinces or territories. Study participants were pregnant and non-pregnant 
      females aged 15-49 years. Individuals were able to participate as controls if 
      they were unvaccinated and fulfilled the other criteria. Data were collected 
      primarily by self-reported survey after both vaccine doses, with telephone 
      follow-up for those reporting any medically attended event. Participants reported 
      significant health events (new or worsening of a health event sufficient to cause 
      work or school absenteeism, medical consultation, or prevent daily activities) 
      occurring within 7 days of vaccination or within the past 7 days for unvaccinated 
      individuals. We employed multivariable logistic regression to examine significant 
      health events associated with mRNA vaccines, adjusting for age group, previous 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, and trimester, as appropriate. FINDINGS: As of Nov 4, 2021, 
      191 360 women aged 15-49 years with known pregnancy status had completed the 
      first vaccine dose survey and 94 937 had completed the second dose survey. 
      180 388 received one dose and 94 262 received a second dose of an mRNA vaccine, 
      with 5597 pregnant participants receiving dose one and 3108 receiving dose two, 
      and 174 765 non-pregnant participants receiving dose one and 91 131 receiving 
      dose two. Of 6179 included unvaccinated control participants, 339 were pregnant 
      and 5840 were not pregnant. Overall, 226 (4·0%) of 5597 vaccinated pregnant 
      females reported a significant health event after dose one of an mRNA vaccine, 
      and 227 (7·3%) of 3108 after dose two, compared with 11 (3·2%) of 339 pregnant 
      unvaccinated females. Pregnant vaccinated females had an increased odds of a 
      significant health event within 7 days of the vaccine after dose two of mRNA-1273 
      (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4·4 [95% CI 2·4-8·3]) compared with pregnant 
      unvaccinated controls within the past 7 days, but not after dose one of mRNA-1273 
      or any dose of BNT162b2. Pregnant vaccinated females had decreased odds of a 
      significant health event compared with non-pregnant vaccinated females after both 
      dose one (aOR 0·63 [95% CI 0·55-0·72]) and dose two (aOR 0·62 [0·54-0·71]) of any 
      mRNA vaccination. There were no significant differences in any analyses when 
      restricted to events which led to medical attention. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 
      mRNA vaccines have a good safety profile in pregnancy. These data can be used to 
      appropriately inform pregnant people regarding reactogenicity of COVID-19 
      vaccines during pregnancy, and should be considered alongside effectiveness and 
      immunogenicity data to make appropriate recommendations about best use of 
      COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy. FUNDING: Canadian Institutes of Health Research,

AB  - BACKGROUND: While long-term studies on the correlates of protection, vaccine 
      effectiveness, and enhanced surveillance are awaited for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, 
      studies on breakthrough infections help understand the nature and course of this 
      illness among vaccinated individuals and guide in public health preparedness. 
      This study aims to compare the differences in the hospitalization outcomes 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection of fully vaccinated individuals with with those of 
      unvaccinated and partially vaccinated individuals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single 
      institution observational cohort study. This study compared the differences in 
      clinical, biochemical parameters and the hospitalization outcomes of 53 fully 
      vaccinated individuals with those of unvaccinated (1464) and partially vaccinated 
      (231) individuals, among a cohort of 2,080 individuals hospitalized with 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. Descriptive statistics and propensity-score weighted 
      multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for clinical and laboratory 
      parameters were used to compare the differences and to identify factors 
      associated with outcomes. RESULTS: Completing the course of vaccination protected 
      individuals from developing severe COVID-19 as evidenced by lower proportions of 
      those with hypoxia, abnormal levels of inflammatory markers, requiring 
      ventilatory support, and death compared to unvaccinated and partially vaccinated 
      individuals. There were no differences in these outcomes among patients who 
      received either vaccine type approved in India. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts should be 
      made to improve the vaccination rates as a timely measure to prepare for the 
      upcoming waves of this highly transmissible pandemic. Vaccination rates of the 
      communities may also guide in the planning of the health needs and appropriate 
      use of medical resources.

      Cohort Study.
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10111914 [doi]
LID - 1914
AB  - Vaccination is effective in preventing COVID-19-related hospitalization among all 
      age groups, but there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of the booster of 
      the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine among adolescents. We analyzed the data on the status of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and their vaccination profiles in adolescents aged 13-18 
      years in Soma city (Fukushima, Japan) (n = 1835) from 14 May to 15 June 2022. The 
      crude incidence rate and 95% confidence interval were calculated with the 
      negative-binomial regression model after classifying the immunization status. The 
      crude effectiveness of a booster administration to prevent infections was 
      estimated as 86.4% (95% confidence interval: 57.2-95.7) when compared with the 
      primary vaccination alone. The results of this study support that the 
      community-based mass vaccination campaign of a booster dose among adolescents has 
      additional protection from COVID-19 during the period of the B.1.1.529 (omicron) 
      variant wave.

TI  - Severe COVID pneumonia and undetectable B cells after vaccination in patients 
      previously treated with rituximab: a case series.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The risk of developing severe COVID-19 illness despite completing 
      vaccination for patients who have previously received immunosuppressive therapy 
      is unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: We present three patients who received rituximab 
      for treatment of autoimmune disorders who subsequently developed severe COVID-19 
      pneumonia post-vaccination requiring intensive care unit admission and found to 
      have undetectable B cells. DISCUSSION: While there have been concerns about the 
      effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in this patient cohort, this is the first case 
      series to report development of severe COVID-19 illness after completing 
      vaccination in those who previously received rituximab. Guidelines for the 
      optimal timing of COVID-19 vaccination in relation to immunosuppressive therapy 
      have been recently published, albeit after many patients in this subpopulation 
      have already been vaccinated. CONCLUSION: This case series brings attention to 
      the limited humoral response to vaccines in patients treated with rituximab, 
      highlights existing guidelines and their limitations, and raises future 
      considerations about the potential benefits to testing vaccine responsiveness.

TI  - Effectiveness of mRNA BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant 
      among elderly residents from a long-term care facility, South of France, May 
      2021.
PG  - 2586-2591
LID - 28496 [pii]
LID - 10.26355/eurrev_202204_28496 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Delta 
      variant was classified as a variant of concern in May 2021 due to its increased 
      transmissibility. It became dominant in Europe during the summer, raising 
      concerns on the effectiveness of vaccines. We assessed the vaccine effectiveness 
      (VE) of mRNA BNT162b2 (BioNTech-Pfizer) against SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant during 
      an outbreak affecting long-term care facility (LTCF) residents in southern 
      France, May 2021. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort 
      study among LTCF residents. We described sex, age, dependency level, reverse 
      transcription PCR and sequencing results, clinical evolution, vaccination status. 
      We compared attack rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19), and severe COVID-19 (respiratory support, hospitalization, 
      and/or death) by vaccination status (two doses administered vs. none) to estimate 
      VE (1 - Relative Risk [RR]) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). VE was adjusted 
      by age (Poisson regression). RESULTS: Among 72 LTCF residents, 75.0% (n=54) were 
      women, mean age was 88.7 (SD 8.1) years, 69% (n=49/71) were severely dependent. 
      SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified in 39 residents (54.2%), 11 with 
      symptomatic, and eight with severe COVID-19. All sequenced samples (n=19, 48.7%) 
      had the same Delta variant genomic sequence. Age-adjusted BNT162b2 VE against 
      SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant infection was 11.2% (95% CI: 0.0-61.1%), it was 88.4% 
      (95% CI: 59.9-96.7%) against symptomatic, and 93.5% (95% CI: 67.2-98.7%) against 
      severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: We found a high BNT162b2 VE against symptomatic and 
      severe COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant among LTCF elderly residents, 
      but not against Delta variant infection. This supports vaccination rollout and 
      the implementation of control measures for close contacts among vaccinated LTCF 
      elderly residents.

AB  - Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is proven to be effective in protecting 
      against severe tuberculosis. It has been suggested to be able to exert a 
      non-specific beneficial effect as protection against other infectious diseases. 
      The duration of protection against tuberculosis is estimated to be from 10 to 
      15 years, but the duration of the protection against other infections is not 
      known, maybe up to 20 years, maybe much shorter than that. We don't know it for 
      sure. BCG induced trained immunity paradigm is based on experimental models, 
      cohort studies with low number of individuals, and some epidemiological data in 
      which other possible interfering factors are not controlled. The titles and 
      scopes of scientific articles should be cautiously considered as they can promote 
      indications of getting vaccinated or revaccinated with BCG, before its 
      effectiveness is confirmed and recommendations are published. Besides, 
      revaccination with BCG can put at serious risk patients with primary or secondary 
      immunodeficiency. Maybe BCG vaccine is effective in preventing COVID-19 deaths or 
      reducing its severity, but may the effect of this vaccine be relevant even with 
      poor health politics and assistance? It is very difficult to compare the 
      epidemiologic data about COVID-19 in different countries. There are countless 
      factors, mainly social and related to the healthcare system, which can be more 
      decisive than the hypothesis of trained immunity induced by BCG. Until now, we 
      can say that BCG's protective role is, at least, insufficient, given many other 
      factors that corroborate SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or its severity.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) booster vaccination has been implemented 
      globally in the midst of surges in infection due to the Delta and Omicron 
      variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The 
      objective of the present study was to present a framework to estimate the 
      proportion of the population that is immune to symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      with the Omicron variant (immune proportion) in Japan, considering the waning of 
      immunity resulting from vaccination and naturally acquired infection. We 
      quantified the decay rate of immunity against symptomatic infection with Omicron 
      conferred by the second and third doses of COVID-19 vaccine. We estimated the 
      current and future vaccination coverage for the second and third vaccine doses 
      from February 17, 2021 to August 1, 2022 and used data on the confirmed COVID-19 
      incidence from February 17, 2021 to April 10, 2022. From this information, we 
      estimated the age-specific immune proportion over the period from February 17, 
      2021 to August 1, 2022. Vaccine-induced immunity, conferred by the second vaccine 
      dose in particular, was estimated to rapidly wane. There were substantial 
      variations in the estimated immune proportion by age group because each age 
      cohort experienced different vaccination rollout timing and speed as well as a 
      different infection risk. Such variations collectively contributed to 
      heterogeneous immune landscape trajectories over time and age. The resulting 
      prediction of the proportion of the population that is immune to symptomatic 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection could aid decision-making on when and for whom another round 
      of booster vaccination should be considered. This manuscript was submitted as 
      part of a theme issue on "Modelling COVID-19 and Preparedness for Future 
      Pandemics".

TI  - Estimation of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Effectiveness Against Medically Attended 
      COVID-19 in Pregnancy During Periods of Delta and Omicron Variant Predominance in 
      the United States.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Pregnant people are at high risk for severe COVID-19 but were 
      excluded from mRNA vaccine trials; data on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) 
      are needed. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the estimated effectiveness of mRNA 
      vaccination against medically attended COVID-19 among pregnant people during 
      Delta and Omicron predominance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 
      test-negative, case-control study was conducted from June 2021 to June 2022 in a 
      network of 306 hospitals and 164 emergency department and urgent care (ED/UC) 
      facilities across 10 US states, including 4517 ED/UC encounters and 975 
      hospitalizations among pregnant people with COVID-19-like illness (CLI) who 
      underwent SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing. EXPOSURES: Two doses (14-149 and ≥150 
      days prior) and 3 doses (7-119 and ≥120 days prior) of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (≥1 
      dose received during pregnancy) vs unvaccinated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Estimated VE against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated ED/UC encounter or 
      hospitalization, based on the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for prior vaccination; VE 
      was calculated as (1 - aOR) × 100%. RESULTS: Among 4517 eligible CLI-associated 
      ED/UC encounters and 975 hospitalizations, 885 (19.6%) and 334 (34.3%) were 
      SARS-CoV-2 positive, respectively; the median (IQR) patient age was 28 (24-32) 
      years and 31 (26-35) years, 537 (12.0%) and 118 (12.0%) were non-Hispanic Black 
      and 1189 (26.0%) and 240 (25.0%) were Hispanic. During Delta predominance, the 
      estimated VE against COVID-19-associated ED/UC encounters was 84% (95% CI, 69% to 
      92%) for 2 doses within 14 to 149 days, 75% (95% CI, 5% to 93%) for 2 doses 150 
      or more days prior, and 81% (95% CI, 30% to 95%) for 3 doses 7 to 119 days prior; 
      estimated VE against COVID-19-associated hospitalization was 99% (95% CI, 96% to 
      100%), 96% (95% CI, 86% to 99%), and 97% (95% CI, 79% to 100%), respectively. 
      During Omicron predominance, for ED/UC encounters, the estimated VE of 2 doses 
      within 14 to 149 days, 2 doses 150 or more days, 3 doses within 7 to 119 days, 
      and 3 doses 120 or more days prior was 3% (95% CI, -49% to 37%), 42% (95% CI, 
      -16% to 72%), 79% (95% CI, 59% to 89%), and -124% (95% CI, -414% to 2%), 
      respectively; for hospitalization, estimated VE was 86% (95% CI, 41% to 97%), 64% 
      (95% CI, -102% to 93%), 86% (95% CI, 28% to 97%), and -53% (95% CI, -1254% to 
      83%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, maternal mRNA 
      COVID-19 vaccination, including booster dose, was associated with protection 
      against medically attended COVID-19. VE estimates were higher against 
      COVID-19-associated hospitalization than ED/UC visits and lower against the 
      Omicron variant than the Delta variant. Protection waned over time, particularly 
      during Omicron predominance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in 
      preventing illness and death from COVID-19 in Córdoba, Argentina, during the 
      period from January through June 2021. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was 
      conducted among 1,139,458 residents of the province of Córdoba. Multiple logistic 
      regression models were developed to describe the relationship between vaccination 
      and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 or death from COVID-19, while taking account of 
      comorbidities and chronic disease risk factors and adjusting for sex and age. 
      RESULTS: Among the general population, having received one or two doses of 
      vaccine reduced the risk of illness by 98.8% and 99.3%, respectively, and the 
      risk of dying by 83% and 96.5%, respectively. Among those who developed COVID-19, 
      the probability of dying was reduced by 57% and 80%, respectively. Regarding 
      probability of death, risk increased with age, with being male, and with obesity, 
      arterial hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: Vaccination is 
      effective and protects against the risk of getting COVID-19, developing severe 
      disease, or dying. Having obesity, arterial hypertension, or diabetes mellitus, 
      in descending order, increases the risk of death.

TI  - Characteristics associated with the residual risk of severe COVID-19 after a 
      complete vaccination schedule: A cohort study of 28 million people in France.
PG  - 100441
LID - 10.1016/j.lanepe.2022.100441 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior to the availability of vaccines, the risk factors for 
      developing severe forms of COVID-19 were mostly older age and various 
      comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, mental disorders, 
      transplantations, and kidney disease. Although vaccines have been shown to be 
      highly effective in preventing severe forms of COVID-19, a residual risk may 
      persist, despite vaccination, for certain population groups. METHODS: The study 
      was based on data from the national COVID-19 vaccination database (VAC-SI) 
      coupled with the National Health Data System (SNDS), which contains comprehensive 
      reimbursement and hospitalisation data for all of France. All people fully 
      vaccinated by July 31, 2021, with a double-injection vaccine, i.e., the mRNA 
      BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines, or a single dose for people 
      with a previous confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included and followed until 
      August 31, 2021. Cox proportional hazard models were performed to estimate 
      adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) for COVID-19-related hospitalisation or in-hospital 
      death associated with age, gender, deprivation index, comorbidities, and 
      immunosuppressive or oral corticosteroid therapy from day 14 after 
      full-vaccination. FINDINGS: In a population of 28,031,641 fully vaccinated 
      individuals with an average follow-up of 80 days, 5,345 (87 hospitalisations per 
      100,000 person-years) were hospitalised for COVID-19 and 996 (16 in-hospital 
      death per 100,000 person-years) died in hospital. In multivariable analysis, a 
      higher risk was observed with increasing age, male gender, and social 
      deprivation. Most of the 47 chronic conditions considered were positively 
      associated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation and a 
      slight excess risk of death. The risk of hospitalisation and in-hospital death 
      for COVID-19 also increased with the use of immunosuppressants (aHR 3.3 [2.8-3.8] 
      and 2.4 [1.7-3.5], respectively) and oral corticosteroids (aHR 2.8 [2.5-3.1] and 
      4.1 [3.3-5.1]).Less than 10% (519/5,345) of hospitalised cases and 2% (24/996) of 
      those who died in hospital had no identified comorbidities. There was a strong 
      association between an increasing number of comorbidities and the risk of 
      hospitalisation and in-hospital death (e.g., 5+ versus none, aHR 10.1 95%CI 
      9.0-11.5 and 17.8 95%CI 11.5-27.4, respectively). INTERPRETATION: Although 
      vaccination has dramatically reduced the occurrence of severe forms of COVID-19, 
      a residual risk remains for the elderly, immunocompromised, and polypathological 
      populations and warrants complementary preventive measures. FUNDING: None.

TI  - Vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19 outcomes within the French overseas 
      territories: A cohort study of 2-doses vaccinated individuals matched to 
      unvaccinated ones followed up until September 2021 and based on the National 
      Health Data System.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Although several observational studies on the effectiveness of 
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have been published, vaccination coverage by August, 3 
      2021, remained low in the French overseas territories, despite Martinique and 
      Guadeloupe experiencing an unprecedented number of COVID-19-related 
      hospitalizations. We aimed to determine the association between COVID-19 
      vaccination and severe COVID-19 in the French overseas territories. METHODS: The 
      French National Health Data System was used to conduct a 1:1 matched-cohort 
      study. For each individual receiving a first dose of BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1 
      nCoV-19, or Ad26.COV2-S vaccine between December 27, 2020, and July 31, 2021, one 
      unvaccinated individual was randomly selected and matched for year of birth, sex, 
      and overseas territories on the date of vaccination. We estimated vaccine 
      effectiveness against COVID-19-related hospitalization and in-hospital death 
      after a full vaccination schedule, defined as ≥14 days after the second dose. 
      Analyses were stratified according to the number of comorbidities. RESULTS: 
      276,778 vaccinated individuals had a double-dose vaccination during the follow-up 
      period and were followed with their paired unvaccinated control. The average age 
      was 50 years and 53% were women. During a median 77 days of follow-up from day 14 
      after the second injection, 96 COVID-19-related hospitalizations occurred among 
      vaccinated individuals and 1,465 among their unvaccinated counterparts. Overall, 
      vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization was 94% (95%CI [93-95]) and 
      exceeded 90% in each overseas territory, except Mayotte. The results were similar 
      looking specifically at hospitalizations between July 15 and September 30, 2021. 
      Vaccine effectiveness against in-hospital death was similar (94% [95%CI 91-96]). 
      The risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization increased with the number of 
      comorbidities, especially among vaccinated individuals. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: In conclusion, vaccination has a major effect in reducing the risk of 
      severe Covid-19 in the French overseas territories. The risk of 
      COVID-19-hospitalization was very low among vaccinated individuals, especially in 
      the absence of comorbidities. These results aim to increase confidence in vaccine 
      effectiveness in overseas territories in hope of achieving better vaccination 
      coverage.

TI  - A Cost-Effectiveness Evaluation of Hospitalizations, Fatalities, and Economic 
      Outcomes Associated with Universal Versus Anaphylaxis Risk-Stratified COVID-19 
      Vaccination Strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaccine-associated anaphylaxis is a rare event (1.34 events/million 
      doses; 0.00017% occurrence over 26 years). Several reports of allergic reactions 
      concerning for anaphylaxis have been reported early into the Pfizer-BioNTech and 
      Moderna coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine campaign in the United 
      States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. OBJECTIVE: To perform a 
      cost-effectiveness analysis characterizing the risks of COVID-19 versus vaccine 
      anaphylaxis, comparing universal COVID-19 vaccination versus risk-stratified 
      vaccination approaches. METHODS: Cohort analysis models were created to evaluate 
      the cost-effectiveness of universal vaccination versus risk-stratified 
      vaccination (eg, contraindicated in persons with a history of any previous 
      episode of anaphylaxis) with a threshold for cost-effective care at $10,000,000 
      per death prevented. In the base case, risk of anaphylaxis was estimated at 0.1%, 
      with case-fatality estimated at 0.3%. RESULTS: On a population level (n = 
      300,000,000 simulated persons), universal vaccination was associated with a 
      cost-savings of $503,596,316 and saved 7,607 lives, but the cost-savings was 
      sensitive to increasing rates of vaccine-associated anaphylaxis. The universal 
      strategy dominated at higher rates of COVID-19 infection and low rates of 
      vaccine-associated anaphylaxis in both the health care and societal perspectives. 
      When the risk of vaccine-associated anaphylaxis exceeded 0.8%, the 
      risk-stratified approach to vaccination was the most cost-effective strategy. 
      There was also an interaction between anaphylaxis risk and anaphylaxis fatality, 
      with a risk-stratified approach becoming cost-effective as each risk increased 
      concurrently. Stratified observation time by anaphylaxis history (15 minutes vs 
      30 minutes) was not cost-effective until a 1% anaphylaxis case-fatality was 
      assumed and risk of vaccine anaphylaxis exceeded 6%. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      demonstrates that unless vaccine anaphylaxis rates exceed 0.8%, a universal 
      vaccination approach dominates a risk-stratified approach where persons with any 
      history of anaphylaxis would be contraindicated from vaccination, with lower cost 
      and superior health outcomes.

      (tozinameran, Pfizer/BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca). METHODS: 
      Com-COV was a participant-masked, randomised immunogenicity trial. For these 
      exploratory analyses, we used the trial's general cohort, in which adults aged 50 
      years or older were randomly assigned to four homologous and four heterologous 
      vaccine schedules using BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 with 4-week or 12-week 
      priming intervals (eight groups in total). Immunogenicity analyses were done on 
      the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, comprising participants with no evidence 
      of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline or for the trial duration, to assess the 
      effect of priming interval on humoral and cellular immune response 28 days and 6 
      months post-second dose, in addition to the effects on reactogenicity and safety. 
      The Com-COV trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 69254139 (EudraCT 
      2020-005085-33). FINDINGS: Between Feb 11 and 26, 2021, 730 participants were 
      randomly assigned in the general cohort, with 77-89 per group in the ITT 
      analysis. At 28 days and 6 months post-second dose, the geometric mean 
      concentration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG was significantly higher in the 
      12-week interval groups than in the 4-week groups for homologous schedules. In 
      heterologous schedule groups, we observed a significant difference between 
      intervals only for the BNT162b2-ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group at 28 days. Pseudotyped 
      virus neutralisation titres were significantly higher in all 12-week interval 
      groups versus 4-week groups, 28 days post-second dose, with geometric mean ratios 
      of 1·4 (95% CI 1·1-1·8) for homologous BNT162b2, 1·5 (1·2-1·9) for ChAdOx1 
      nCoV-19-BNT162b2, 1·6 (1·3-2·1) for BNT162b2-ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and 2·4 (1·7-3·2) 
      for homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. At 6 months post-second dose, anti-spike IgG 
      geometric mean concentrations fell to 0·17-0·24 of the 28-day post-second dose 
      value across all eight study groups, with only homologous BNT162b2 showing a 
      slightly slower decay for the 12-week versus 4-week interval in the adjusted 
      analysis. The rank order of schedules by humoral response was unaffected by 
      interval, with homologous BNT162b2 remaining the most immunogenic by antibody 
      response. T-cell responses were reduced in all 12-week priming intervals compared 
      with their 4-week counterparts. 12-week schedules for homologous BNT162b2 and 
      ChAdOx1 nCoV-19-BNT162b2 were up to 80% less reactogenic than 4-week schedules. 
      INTERPRETATION: These data support flexibility in priming interval in all studied 
      COVID-19 vaccine schedules. Longer priming intervals might result in lower 
      reactogenicity in schedules with BNT162b2 as a second dose and higher humoral 
      immunogenicity in homologous schedules, but overall lower T-cell responses across 
      all schedules. Future vaccines using these novel platforms might benefit from 
      schedules with long intervals. FUNDING: UK Vaccine Taskforce and National 
      Institute for Health and Care Research.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      vaccination has been effective in protecting against severe COVID-19 infections 
      and related mortality. It is recommended for all individuals including patients 
      with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, safety data are lacking in this 
      group of patients. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the short- and long-term vaccine 
      related adverse events (AEs) in patients with IBD. METHODS: This is a 
      prospective, observational cohort study investigating short- and long-term AEs 
      related to the BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with IBD (study group) after the 
      first and second dose compared to healthy participants (control group). Patients 
      were recruited at the time of attendance to the clinic or infusion rooms. Short 
      term (<3 weeks) localized and systemic AEs were assessed via questionnaire. 
      Follow-up phone-based survey was made to collect data on long term (up to 24 
      weeks) AEs. RESULTS: A total of 408 patients answered the questionnaires, 204 
      patients in each group, the study and control group. No serious adverse events 
      were reported in either the study or the control group after the first or the 
      second dose. Participants in the control group reported more frequent pain at the 
      injection site than those in the study group after the first dose [58 (57%) vs. 
      38 (37%) respectively, P = 0.005]. After the second dose, tiredness was reported 
      more frequently in the control group [49 (48%)] compared to the study group [25 
      (24%) (P < 0.001)]. At 20-24 weeks post vaccination, 386 out of 408 (94.6%) 
      patients were willing to participate in the follow-up phone based questionnaire 
      [196 (96.1%) in the study group vs. 190 (93.1%) in the control group]. In both 
      groups, none of the patients reported local, systemic, or severe adverse events 
      (0 out of 386) at week 20-24 post second dose. CONCLUSION: The BNT162b2 vaccine 
      is safe in patients with IBD. No severe or long-term adverse events were reported 
      in our study. The frequency of local and systemic adverse events after the second 
      dose was generally higher among healthy participants compared to patients with 
      IBD. Further studies including a larger cohort with a longer follow-up duration 
      are needed to assess for possible rare adverse events.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since its emergence in November, 2021, in southern Africa, the 
      SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant of concern (VOC) has rapidly spread across the world. 
      We aimed to investigate the severity of omicron and the extent to which booster 
      vaccines are effective in preventing symptomatic infection. METHODS: In this 
      study, using the Scotland-wide Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced 
      Surveillance of COVID-19 (EAVE II) platform, we did a cohort analysis with a 
      nested test-negative design incident case-control study covering the period Nov 
      1-Dec 19, 2021, to provide initial estimates of omicron severity and the 
      effectiveness of vaccine boosters against symptomatic disease relative to 25 
      weeks or more after the second vaccine dose. Primary care data derived from 940 
      general practices across Scotland were linked to laboratory data and hospital 
      admission data. We compared outcomes between infection with the delta VOC 
      (defined as S-gene positive) and the omicron VOC (defined as S-gene negative). We 
      assessed effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, with infection 
      confirmed through a positive RT-PCR. FINDINGS: By Dec 19, 2021, there were 23 840 
      S-gene-negative cases in Scotland, which were predominantly among those aged 
      20-39 years (11 732 [49·2%]). The proportion of S-gene-negative cases that were 
      possible reinfections was more than ten times that of S-gene-positive cases (7·6% 
      vs 0·7%; p<0·0001). There were 15 hospital admissions in S-gene-negative 
      individuals, giving an adjusted observed-to-expected admissions ratio of 0·32 
      (95% CI 0·19-0·52). The booster vaccine dose was associated with a 57% (54-60) 
      reduction in the risk of symptomatic S-gene-negative infection relative to 
      individuals who tested positive 25 weeks or more after the second vaccine dose. 
      INTERPRETATION: These early national data suggest that omicron is associated with 
      a two-thirds reduction in the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation compared with 
      delta. Although offering the greatest protection against delta, the booster dose 
      of vaccination offers substantial additional protection against the risk of 
      symptomatic COVID-19 for omicron compared with 25 weeks or more after the second 
      vaccine dose. FUNDING: Health Data Research UK, National Core Studies, Public

AB  - IMPORTANCE: There is a lack of information regarding the need to postpone 
      conception after COVID-19 vaccination. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the time 
      interval between the first dose of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine and in vitro 
      fertilization (IVF) treatment as well as the rate of pregnancy after a fresh 
      embryo transfer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was 
      conducted at a single public IVF center in China. Female patients aged 20 to 47 
      years and undergoing IVF treatment were consecutively registered from May 1 to 
      December 22, 2021, with follow-up until March 31, 2022. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 
      infection before or during IVF treatment and those who underwent 2 or more IVF 
      treatments, received the noninactivated or unknown COVID-19 vaccine, or did not 
      have a fresh embryo transfer were excluded from this study. EXPOSURES: The 
      vaccinated group (subdivided into 4 subgroups of time interval from first 
      vaccination to fertilization treatment: ≤30 days, 31-60 days, 61-90 days, and ≥91 
      days) and nonvaccinated group. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk ratios (RRs) for 
      the association between the time interval and ongoing pregnancy (pregnancy 
      continued at least 12 weeks). RESULTS: A total of 3052 female patients (mean [SD] 
      age, 31.45 [3.96] years) undergoing IVF treatment were analyzed in this study. 
      There were 667 vaccinated patients receiving IVF (35 were vaccinated ≤30 days, 58 
      were vaccinated 31-60 days, 105 were vaccinated 61-90 days, and 469 were 
      vaccinated ≥91 days before fertilization treatment), and 2385 unvaccinated 
      patients receiving treatment. The ovarian stimulation and laboratory parameters 
      were similar among all groups. Ongoing pregnancy was significantly lower in the 
      30 days or less subgroup (34.3% [12 of 35]; adjusted RR [aRR], 0.61; 95% CI, 
      0.33-0.91) and the 31 to 60 days' subgroup (36.2% [21 of 58]; aRR, 0.63; 95% CI, 
      0.42-0.85). A slightly but not statistically lower rate was found in the 61 to 90 
      days' subgroup, and no reduced risk for ongoing pregnancy in the 91 days or more 
      subgroup was observed (56.3% [264 of 469]; aRR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.88-1.04) compared 
      with the unvaccinated group (60.3% [1439 of 2385], as reference). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: Findings of this study suggest that receipt of the first inactivated 
      COVID-19 vaccine dose 60 days or less before fertilization treatment is 
      associated with a reduced rate of pregnancy. In patients undergoing IVF treatment 
      with a fresh embryo transfer, the procedure may need to be delayed until at least 
      61 days after COVID-19 vaccination.

TI  - Vaccine effectiveness of the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 against 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents of long-term care facilities in England 
      (VIVALDI): a prospective cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in older adults living in 
      long-term care facilities is uncertain. We investigated the protective effect of 
      the first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca non-replicating viral-vectored vaccine 
      (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; AZD1222) and the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA-based vaccine (BNT162b2) 
      in residents of long-term care facilities in terms of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 
      infection over time since vaccination. METHODS: The VIVALDI study is a 
      prospective cohort study that commenced recruitment on June 11, 2020, to 
      investigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission, infection outcomes, and immunity in 
      residents and staff in long-term care facilities in England that provide 
      residential or nursing care for adults aged 65 years and older. In this cohort 
      study, we included long-term care facility residents undergoing routine 
      asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 testing between Dec 8, 2020 (the date the vaccine was 
      first deployed in a long-term care facility), and March 15, 2021, using national 
      testing data linked within the COVID-19 Datastore. Using Cox proportional hazards 
      regression, we estimated the relative hazard of PCR-positive infection at 0-6 
      days, 7-13 days, 14-20 days, 21-27 days, 28-34 days, 35-48 days, and 49 days and 
      beyond after vaccination, comparing unvaccinated and vaccinated person-time from 
      the same cohort of residents, adjusting for age, sex, previous infection, local 
      SARS-CoV-2 incidence, long-term care facility bed capacity, and clustering by 
      long-term care facility. We also compared mean PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values 
      for positive swabs obtained before and after vaccination. The study is registered 
      with ISRCTN, number 14447421. FINDINGS: 10 412 care home residents aged 65 years 
      and older from 310 LTCFs were included in this analysis. The median participant 
      age was 86 years (IQR 80-91), 7247 (69·6%) of 10 412 residents were female, and 
      1155 residents (11·1%) had evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. 9160 
      (88·0%) residents received at least one vaccine dose, of whom 6138 (67·0%) 
      received ChAdOx1 and 3022 (33·0%) received BNT162b2. Between Dec 8, 2020, and 
      March 15, 2021, there were 36 352 PCR results in 670 628 person-days, and 1335 
      PCR-positive infections (713 in unvaccinated residents and 612 in vaccinated 
      residents) were included. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for PCR-positive infection 
      relative to unvaccinated residents declined from 28 days after the first vaccine 
      dose to 0·44 (95% CI 0·24-0·81) at 28-34 days and 0·38 (0·19-0·77) at 35-48 days. 
      Similar effect sizes were seen for ChAdOx1 (adjusted HR 0·32, 95% CI 0·15-0·66) 
      and BNT162b2 (0·35, 0·17-0·71) vaccines at 35-48 days. Mean PCR Ct values were 
      higher for infections that occurred at least 28 days after vaccination than for 
      those occurring before vaccination (31·3 [SD 8·7] in 107 PCR-positive tests vs 
      26·6 [6·6] in 552 PCR-positive tests; p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Single-dose 
      vaccination with BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines provides substantial protection 
      against infection in older adults from 4-7 weeks after vaccination and might 
      reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, the risk of infection is not eliminated, 
      highlighting the ongoing need for non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent 
      transmission in long-term care facilities. FUNDING: UK Government Department of

TI  - Duration of vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisation, 
      and death in residents and staff of long-term care facilities in England 
      (VIVALDI): a prospective cohort study.
PG  - e470-e480
LID - 10.1016/S2666-7568(22)00147-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Residents and staff in long-term care facilities have been 
      prioritised for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, but data on potential waning of 
      vaccine effectiveness and the effect of booster doses in this vulnerable 
      population are scarce. We aimed to evaluate effectiveness of one, two, and three 
      vaccine doses against infection and severe clinical outcomes in staff and 
      residents of long-term care facilities in England over the first year following 
      vaccine roll-out. METHODS: The VIVALDI study is a prospective cohort study done 
      in 331 long-term care facilities in England. Residents aged 65 years or older and 
      staff aged 18 years or older were eligible for participation. Participants had 
      routine PCR testing throughout the study period between Dec 8, 2020, and Dec 11, 
      2021. We retrieved all PCR results and cycle threshold values for PCR-positive 
      samples from routine testing in long-term care facilities, and positive PCR 
      results from clinical testing in hospitals through the UK's COVID-19 Datastore. 
      PCR results were linked to participants using pseudo-identifiers based on 
      individuals' unique UK National Health Service (NHS) numbers, which were also 
      used to retrieve vaccination records from the National Immunisation Management 
      Service, hospitalisation records from NHS England, and deaths data from the 
      Office for National Statistics through the COVID-19 Datastore. In a Cox 
      proportional hazards regression, we estimated vaccine effectiveness against 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation, and COVID-19-related 
      death after one, two, and three vaccine doses, separately by previous SARS-CoV-2 
      exposure. This study is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN 14447421. 
      FINDINGS: 80 186 residents and staff of long-term care facilities had records 
      available for the study period, of whom 15 518 eligible residents and 19 515 
      eligible staff were included in the analysis. For residents without evidence of 
      previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure, vaccine effectiveness decreased from 61·7% (95% CI 
      35·1 to 77·4) to 22·0% (-14·9 to 47·0) against infection; from 89·0% (70·6 to 
      95·9) to 56·3% (30·1 to 72·6) against hospitalisation; and from 96·4% (84·3 to 
      99·2) to 64·4% (36·1 to 80·1) against death, when comparing 14-83 days after dose 
      two and 84 days or more after dose two. For staff without evidence of previous 
      exposure, vaccine effectiveness against infection decreased slightly from 57·9% 
      (43·1 to 68·9) at 14-83 days after dose two to 42·1% (29·9 to 52·2) at 84 days or 
      more after dose two. There were no hospitalisations or deaths among unexposed 
      staff at 14-83 days, but seven hospitalisations (vaccine effectiveness 91·0% [95% 
      CI 74·3 to 96·8]) and one death were observed at 84 days or more after dose two. 
      High vaccine effectiveness was restored following a third vaccine dose, with 
      vaccine effectiveness in unexposed residents of 72·7% (55·8 to 83·1) against 
      infection, 90·1% (80·6 to 95·0) against hospitalisation, and 97·5% (88·1 to 99·5) 
      against death; and vaccine effectiveness in unexposed staff of 78·2% (70·0 to 
      84·1) against infection and 95·8% (49·9 to 99·6) against hospitalisation. There 
      were no COVID-19-related deaths among unexposed staff after the third vaccine 
      dose. INTERPRETATION: Our findings showed substantial waning of SARS-CoV-2 
      vaccine effectiveness against all outcomes in residents of long-term care 
      facilities from 12 weeks after a primary course of ChAdOx1-S or mRNA vaccines. 
      Boosters restored protection, and maximised immunity across all outcomes. These 
      findings show the importance of boosting and the need for ongoing surveillance in 
      this vulnerable cohort. FUNDING: UK Government Department of Health and Social

AB  - Vaccines against COVID-19 have been available in Germany since December 2020. At 
      the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the Immunization Unit is responsible for 
      monitoring vaccination coverage and assessment of vaccine effectiveness. This 
      article provides an overview of the respective reporting structures, vaccination 
      databases, and epidemiological studies established by the Immunization Unit 
      during the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe the COVID-19 Digital Vaccination 
      Coverage Monitoring (DIM), which provides daily updates on vaccination coverage 
      by age group. We next describe how, based on the DIM data and COVID-19 case data, 
      the assessment of vaccine effectiveness against different clinical endpoints 
      (hospitalization, intensive care, death) is performed. While this method is used 
      for a preliminary estimate of vaccine efficacy, population-based nonrandomized 
      studies are able to provide more precise and detailed estimates under 
      "real-world" conditions. In this context, we describe the hospital-based 
      case-control study COViK, which is being conducted in collaboration with the Paul 
      Ehrlich Institute (PEI). We discuss strengths and limitations of the 
      abovementioned structures and tools. Finally, we provide an outlook on future 
      challenges that may arise during the ongoing pandemic and during the transition 
      phase into an endemic situation.

TI  - Relative vaccine effectiveness of the booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine for 
      preventing death in individuals with a primary regimen based on the BBIBP-CorV, 
      ChAdOx1-S, or BNT162b2 vaccines during the Omicron wave in Peru: A nested 
      case-control study using national population data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have reported evidence about the effectiveness of a third 
      dose with BNT162b2 for preventing hospitalization and death by COVID-19. However, 
      there is little evidence regarding other primary vaccine schedules such as 
      BBIBP-CorV and ChAdOx1-S. We estimated the relative vaccine effectiveness (RVE) 
      of the booster dose versus the primary regimens of COVID-19 vaccines based on 
      BBIBP-CorV, ChAdOx1-S, or BNT162b2 for preventing death during the Omicron wave 
      in Peruvian adult people. METHODS: We carried out a nested case-control study 
      with a risk set sampling of controls using data from Peru between December 20, 
      2021, and February 20, 2022 (during the Omicron wave). Data on vaccination, 
      COVID-19 tests and deaths were collected from national surveillance databases. We 
      performed conditional logistic regression models to estimate the RVE on the adult 
      population. In addition, we executed sub-group analysis per age group (18 to 
      59 years, and 60 years or more) and per primary regime (based on BNT162b2, 
      BBIBP-CorV, or ChAdOx1-S). RESULTS: Of the 11,188,332 people eligible to enter 
      the study 1,974 met the case definition (death from COVID-19) and were matched to 
      9,183 controls. The overall RVE of a third dose to prevent death was 87.2% 
      (84.2%-89.7%), which varied according to the primary regime (87.3% for BNT162b2, 
      82.0% for BBIPB-CorV-2, and 79.5% for ChAdOx-S). In older adults, the RVE was 
      87.1%, without significant variations according to the primary regime (86.1% for 
      BNT162b2, 86.1 for BBIBP-CorV, and 82% for ChAdOx-S). CONCLUSIONS: The booster) 
      dose of vaccine against COVID-19 had a high RVE for preventing death by COVID-19 
      in the Peruvian population in all primary regimes of vaccines during the Omicron 
      wave. This effect was consistent in people over 60 years of age, the group most 
      vulnerable to die from this infection.

AB  - During a COVID-19 outbreak in a prison in Zambia from December 14 to 19, 2021, a 
      case-control study was done to measure vaccine effectiveness (VE) against 
      infection and symptomatic infection, when the Omicron variant was the dominant 
      circulating variant. Among 382 participants, 74.1% were fully vaccinated, and the 
      median time since full vaccination was 54 days. There were no hospitalizations or 
      deaths. COVID-19 VE against any SARS-CoV-2 infection was 64.8%, and VE against 
      symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was 72.9%. COVID-19 vaccination helped protect 
      incarcerated persons against SARS-CoV-2 infection during an outbreak while 
      Omicron was the dominant variant in Zambia. These findings provide important 
      local evidence that might be used to increase COVID-19 vaccination in Zambia and 
      other countries in Africa.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 variant Beta (B.1.351) was designated as a Variant of 
      Concern (VoC) after becoming the dominant strain in South Africa and spreading 
      internationally. BNT162b2 showed lower levels of neutralizing antibodies against 
      Beta than against other strains raising concerns about effectiveness of vaccines 
      against infections caused by Beta. We estimated BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness 
      (VE) against Beta infections in Israel, a country with high vaccine uptake. 
      METHODS: The Ministry of Health (MoH) identified Beta cases through mandatory 
      reporting of SARS-CoV-2 cases and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of specimens from 
      vaccination-breakthrough infections, reinfections, arriving international 
      travelers, and a selection of other infected persons. A cohort analysis was 
      conducted of exposure events of contacts of primary Beta cases. WGS was conducted 
      on available PCR-positive specimens collected from contacts. VE estimates with 
      95% confidence intervals (CIs) against confirmed and probable Beta infections 
      were determined by comparing infection risk between unvaccinated and 
      fully-vaccinated (≥7 days after the second dose) contacts, and between 
      unvaccinated and partially-vaccinated (<7 days after the second dose) contacts. 
      FINDINGS: MoH identified 310 Beta cases through Jun 27, 2021. During the study 
      period (Dec 11, 2020 - Mar 25, 2021), 164 non-institutionalized primary Beta 
      cases, with 552 contacts aged ≥16 years, were identified. 343/552 (62%) contacts 
      were interviewed and tested. 71/343 (21%) contacts were PCR-positive. WGS was 
      performed on 7/71 (10%) PCR-positive specimens; all were Beta. Among 
      SARS-CoV-2-infected contacts, 48/71 (68%) were symptomatic, 10/71 (14%) 
      hospitalized, and 2/71 (3%) died. Fully-vaccinated VE against confirmed or 
      probable Beta infections was 72% (95% CI -5 - 97%; p=0·04) and against 
      symptomatic confirmed or probable Beta infections was 100% (95% CI 19 - 100%; 
      p=0·01). There was no evidence of protection in partially-vaccinated contacts. 
      INTERPRETATION: In a prospective observational study, two doses of BNT162b2 were 
      effective against confirmed and probable Beta infections. Through the end of June 
      2021, introductions of Beta did not interrupt control of the pandemic in Israel.

AB  - Effectiveness of corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) vaccines used in India is 
      unexplored and need to be substantiated. The present case-control study was 
      planned to elicit the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing infection 
      and disease severity in the general population of Bihar, India. This case-control 
      study was conducted among people aged ≥45 years during April to June 2021. The 
      cases were the COVID-19 patients admitted or visited All India Institute of 
      Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Patna, Bihar, India, and were contacted directly. The 
      controls were the individuals tested negative for severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) at the Virology laboratory, AIIMS-Patna and 
      contacted telephonically for collection of relevant information. The vaccine 
      effectiveness (VE) was calculated by using the formula (VE = 1 - odds ratio). The 
      adjusted VE for partial and full vaccination were estimated to be 52.0% (95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 39.0-63.0%) and 83.0% (95% CI 73.0-89.0%) respectively 
      for preventing SARS CoV-2 infection. The sub-group analyses of the cases have 
      shown that the length of hospital stays (LOS) (partially vaccinated: 9 days vs. 
      unvaccinated: 12 days; P = 0.028) and the severity of the disease (fully 
      vaccinated: 30.3% vs. partially vaccinated: 51.3% and unvaccinated: 54.1%; P = 
      0.035) were significantly low among vaccinated compared to unvaccinated 
      individuals. To conclude, four out of every five fully vaccinated individuals are 
      estimated to be protected from contracting SARS CoV-2 infection. Vaccination 
      lowered LOS and chances of development of severe disease.

AB  - COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 
      11, 2020. Since then, efforts were initiated to develop safe and effective 
      vaccines. Till date, 11 vaccines have been included in the WHO's emergency use 
      list. The emergence and spread of variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 has altered the 
      disease transmission dynamics, thus creating a need for continuously monitoring 
      the real-world effectiveness of various vaccines and assessing their overall 
      impact on disease control. To achieve this goal, the Indian Council of Medical 
      Research (ICMR) along with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government 
      of India, took the lead to develop the India COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker by 
      synergizing three different public health databases: National COVID-19 testing 
      database, CoWIN vaccination database and the COVID-19 India portal. A Vaccine 
      Data Analytics Committee (VDAC) was constituted to advise on various modalities 
      of the proposed tracker. The VDAC reviewed the data related to COVID-19 testing, 
      vaccination and patient outcomes available in the three databases and selected 
      relevant data points for inclusion in the tracker, following which databases were 
      integrated, using common identifiers, wherever feasible. Multiple data filters 
      were applied to retrieve information of all individuals ≥18 yr who died after the 
      acquisition of COVID-19 infection with or without vaccination, irrespective of 
      the time between vaccination and test positivity. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) 
      against the reduction of mortality and hospitalizations was initially assessed. 
      As compared to the hospitalization data, mortality reporting was found to be much 
      better in terms of correctness and completeness. Therefore, hospitalization data 
      were not considered for analysis and presentation in the vaccine tracker. The 
      vaccine tracker thus depicts VE against mortality, calculated by a cohort 
      approach using person-time analysis. Incidence of COVID-19 deaths among one- and 
      two-dose vaccine recipients was compared with that among unvaccinated groups, to 
      estimate the rate ratios (RRs). VE was estimated as 96.6 and 97.5 per cent, with 
      one and two doses of the vaccines, respectively, during the period of reporting. 
      The India COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker was officially launched on September 9, 
      2021. The high VE against mortality, as demonstrated by the tracker, has helped 
      aid in allaying vaccine hesitancy, augmenting and maintaining the momentum of 
      India's COVID-19 vaccination drive.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: It is important to understand the association between staff 
      vaccination rates and adverse COVID-19 outcomes in nursing homes. OBJECTIVE: To 
      assess the extent to which staff vaccination was associated with preventing 
      COVID-19 cases and deaths among residents and staff in nursing homes. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This longitudinal cohort study used data on COVID-19 
      outcomes in Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes in the US between May 
      30, 2021, and January 30, 2022. Participants included the residents of 15 042 US 
      nursing homes that reported COVID-19 data to the Centers for Disease Control and 
      Prevention and passed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data quality 
      checks in the National Healthcare Safety Network. EXPOSURES: Weekly staff 
      vaccination rates. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Main outcomes are weekly COVID-19 
      cases and deaths among residents and weekly COVID-19 cases among staff. The 
      treatment variable is the primary 2-dose staff vaccination rate in each facility 
      each week. RESULTS: In the primary analysis of 15 042 nursing homes before the 
      Omicron variant wave (May 30 to December 5, 2021) using fixed effects of facility 
      and week, increasing weekly staff vaccination rates by 10 percentage points was 
      associated with 0.13 (95% CI, -0.20 to -0.10) fewer weekly COVID-19 cases per 
      1000 residents, 0.02 (95% CI, -0.03 to -0.01) fewer weekly COVID-19 deaths per 
      1000 residents, and 0.03 (95% CI, -0.04 to -0.02) fewer weekly COVID-19 staff 
      cases. In the secondary analysis of the Omicron wave (December 5, 2021, to 
      January 30, 2022), increasing staff vaccination rates were not associated with 
      lower rates of adverse COVID-19 outcomes in nursing homes. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: The findings of this cohort study suggest that before the Omicron 
      variant wave, increasing staff vaccination rates was associated with lower 
      incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths among residents and staff in US nursing 
      homes. However, as newer, more infectious and transmissible variants of the virus 
      emerged, the original 2-dose regimen of the COVID-19 vaccine as recommended in 
      December 2020 was no longer associated with lower rates of adverse COVID-19 
      outcomes in nursing homes. Policy makers may want to consider longer-term policy 
      options to increase the uptake of booster doses among staff in nursing homes.

      Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, Including Variants of Concern: 
      Test-Negative Design, British Columbia, Canada.
PG  - 485-496
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiac023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In British Columbia, Canada, most adults 50-69 years old became 
      eligible for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine 
      in April 2021, with chimpanzee adenoviral vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1) restricted 
      to ≥55-year-olds and second doses deferred ≥6 weeks to optimize single-dose 
      coverage. METHODS: Among adults 50-69 years old, single-dose messenger RNA (mRNA) 
      and ChAdOx1 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
      hospitalization, including variant-specific, was assessed by test-negative design 
      between 4 April and 2 October 2021. RESULTS: Single-dose VE included 11 861 cases 
      and 99 544 controls. Median of postvaccination follow-up was 32 days 
      (interquartile range, 15-52 days). Alpha, Gamma, and Delta variants comprised 
      23%, 18%, and 56%, respectively, of genetically characterized viruses. At 21-55 
      days postvaccination, single-dose mRNA and ChAdOx1 VE (95% confidence interval 
      [CI]) was 74% (71%-76%) and 59% (53%-65%) against any infection and 86% (80%-90%) 
      and 94% (85%-97%) against hospitalization, respectively. VE (95% CI) was similar 
      against Alpha and Gamma infections for mRNA (80% [76%-84%] and 80% [75%-84%], 
      respectively) and ChAdOx1 (69% [60%-76%] and 66% [56%-73%], respectively). mRNA 
      VE was lower at 63% (95% CI, 56%-69%) against Delta but 85% (95% CI, 71%-92%) 
      against Delta-associated hospitalization (nonestimable for ChAdOx1). CONCLUSIONS: 
      A single mRNA or ChAdOx1 vaccine dose gave important protection against 
      SARS-CoV-2, including early variants of concern. ChAdOx1 VE was lower against 
      infection, but 1 dose of either vaccine reduced the hospitalization risk by >85% 
      to at least 8 weeks postvaccination. Findings inform program options, including 
      longer dosing intervals.

TI  - Two-Dose Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Vaccine Effectiveness 
      With Mixed Schedules and Extended Dosing Intervals: Test-Negative Design Studies 
      From British Columbia and Quebec, Canada.
PG  - 1980-1992
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac290 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Canadian coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) immunization 
      strategy deferred second doses and allowed mixed schedules. We compared 2-dose 
      vaccine effectiveness (VE) by vaccine type (mRNA and/or ChAdOx1), interval 
      between doses, and time since second dose in 2 of Canada's larger provinces. 
      METHODS: Two-dose VE against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection or hospitalization among adults ≥18 years, including due 
      to Alpha, Gamma, and Delta variants of concern (VOCs), was assessed ≥14 days 
      postvaccination by test-negative design studies separately conducted in British 
      Columbia and Quebec, Canada, between 30 May and 27 November (epi-weeks 22-47) 
      2021. RESULTS: In both provinces, all homologous or heterologous mRNA and/or 
      ChAdOx1 2-dose schedules were associated with ≥90% reduction in SARS-CoV-2 
      hospitalization risk for ≥7 months. With slight decline from a peak of >90%, VE 
      against infection was ≥80% for ≥6 months following homologous mRNA vaccination, 
      lower by ∼10% when both doses were ChAdOx1 but comparably high following 
      heterologous ChAdOx1 + mRNA receipt. Findings were similar by age group, sex, and 
      VOC. VE was significantly higher with longer 7-8-week versus 
      manufacturer-specified 3-4-week intervals between mRNA doses. CONCLUSIONS: Two 
      doses of any mRNA and/or ChAdOx1 combination gave substantial and sustained 
      protection against SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization, spanning Delta-dominant 
      circulation. ChAdOx1 VE against infection was improved by heterologous mRNA 
      series completion. A 7-8-week interval between first and second doses improved 
      mRNA VE and may be the optimal schedule outside periods of intense epidemic 
      surge. Findings support interchangeability and extended intervals between 
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses, with potential global implications for low-coverage 
      areas and, going forward, for children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: New vaccines are being developed to fight the ongoing COVID-19 
      pandemic. In our study we compared the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines to prevent 
      COVID-19-related infections and mortality. METHODS: 17 randomized clinical trials 
      of COVID-19 vaccines were included after search in databases. We compared 
      COVID-19 vaccines based on symptomatic and severe infections, number of deaths 
      and hospitalizations related to COVID-19. Also, we analyzed the efficacy of 
      COVID-19 against different variants of SARS-CoV-2 as well as according to 
      different age groups. Random effects model using Mantel-Haenzeal method was used 
      to pool relative risk (RR). RESULTS: Our meta-analysis shows that full 
      vaccination could decrease not only the risk of symptomatic or severe COVID-19, 
      the risk of hospitalization and death caused by COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines were 
      also effective against variants of SARS-CoV-2 (RR = 0.36; 95% CI [0.25; 0.53], 
      p < 0.0001). However, efficacy of vaccination varied in COVID-19 
      variant-dependent manner. Moreover, the analysis in different age groups showed 
      that COVID-19 vaccines had the similar results: the risk was slightly lower in 
      adults compared to elderly cohort [Formula: see text] 65 years): (RR = 0.16, 95% 
      CI [0.11; 0.23]) and (RR = 0.19, 95% CI [0.12; 0.30]), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Data obtained from clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines looks promising, in order 
      to fully investigate efficacy of the vaccines further clinical examination is 
      required especially considering new SARS-CoV-2 variants.

TI  - Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospital workers before and after 
      vaccination programme in East Java, Indonesia-A retrospective cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) among 
      healthcare workers (HCWs) is widespread. It is important to understand COVID-19 
      characteristics among HCWs before and after vaccination. We evaluated the 
      incidence of COVID-19 among HCWs in East Java, Indonesia comparing the 
      characteristics of the disease between the pre- vs post-vaccination periods. 
      METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted among HCWs in two 
      major hospitals in East Java, Indonesia, between April 01, 2020, and Oct 31, 
      2021. All HCWs were offered vaccination with inactivated viral vaccine 
      (CoronaVac) from Jan 15, 2021. Therefore, we divided the time of the study into 
      the pre-vaccination period (between April 01, 2020, and Jan 14, 2021) and 
      post-vaccination period (between Jan 15 and Oct 31, 2021). We then compared the 
      pattern of COVID-19 infections, and hospitalisations between these periods. 
      FINDINGS: A total of 434 (15.1%) and 649 (22.6%) SARS-CoV-2 infections were 
      reported among study participants (n = 2878) during the pre-vaccination and 
      post-vaccination periods, respectively. The vaccine effectiveness was 73.3% 
      during the first 3-4 months after vaccination but this decreased to 17.6% at 6-7 
      months after vaccination, which coincided with the emergence of the delta 
      variant. The overall hospitalisation rate was reduced from 23.5% in the 
      pre-vaccination period to 14.3% in the post-vaccination period. Hypertension 
      appeared to be the strongest risk factor affecting hospitalisation in the 
      pre-vaccination period. However, the risk due to hypertension was reduced in the 
      post-vaccination period. INTERPRETATION: The risk to contract COVID-19 remains 
      high among HCWs in East Java, Indonesia. Vaccination is important to reduce 
      infection and hospitalisation. It is essentially important to evaluate the 
      characteristics of COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation, the impact of 
      co-morbidities and vaccine effectiveness in order to improve the measures applied 
      in protecting HCWs during the pandemic. FUNDING: Mandate Research Grant

TI  - Effectiveness of the Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (Vero Cell) Vaccine in Peruvian 
      Health Workers.
LID - 10.3390/life12091318 [doi]
LID - 1318
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health crisis. Vaccines 
      against this disease have demonstrated variable efficacy and safety, although 
      effectiveness has not been evaluated. In February 2021, the Ministry of Health of 
      Peru approved the emergency use of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (Vero Cell) vaccine 
      and initiated vaccination with health personnel at the national level. The 
      objective of the study is to determine the effectiveness of this vaccine to 
      reduce infections, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: We 
      performed a retrospective cohort study in the period from 23 February to 26 June 
      2021; data were obtained from the Ministry of Health (including demographic, 
      epidemiologic, clinical, hospital, laboratory results, deaths, and both date and 
      quantity of vaccine doses delivered). The exposed cohort were those who received 
      one or two vaccine doses and the non-exposed were unvaccinated. The events 
      studied were infections, hospitalizations and deaths in the cohorts. We consider 
      a case confirmed for COVID-19 if the test result was positive for SARS-CoV-2, via 
      PCR or antigen test. Effectiveness was measured with incidence density ratio and 
      risk. Confounding factors were controlled using a Poisson model with robust 
      variance. RESULTS: We enlisted 520,733 health workers, of whom 415,212 had two 
      vaccine doses and 105,521 were unvaccinated. The median age was 40 years (IQR: 
      32-50), and 65.6% were female. The effectiveness of two vaccine doses fourteen 
      days after application adjusted by age, sex, hospitalization, and antecedent of 
      having the infection was 90.9% (95% CI: 85.5-94.2%); effectiveness to avoid death 
      from COVID-19; 67.7% (60.1-73.8%) effectiveness to avoid hospitalizations; and 
      26.3% (23.8-28.6%) effectiveness to reduce the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 
      relative to the unvaccinated cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The inactivated SARS-CoV-2 
      (Vero Cell) vaccine used in two doses has an acceptable effectiveness against 
      death and risk of hospitalization, whereas it has less effectiveness in 
      preventing COVID-19 infection.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to pose a threat to public health 
      with the potential for the emergence of new variants. Vaccines are the milestones 
      to control and slow down the damage of the pandemic. As of January 2021, a 
      two-dose regimen with CoronaVac was authorized in Turkey. Due to the waning 
      seroprevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2 over time, BNT162b2 or CoronaVac has been 
      administered as the third dose following a two-dose CoronaVac regimen as a 
      national vaccination policy. As of 14 January 2021, 5243 volunteers who received 
      two doses of the CoronaVac vaccine at Hacettepe University Adult Vaccine Center 
      were followed prospectively. In our study, relative vaccine effectiveness 
      (VE(ff)) for the third dose of the CoronaVac was 58.24% and 87.27% for BNT162b2 
      in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 cases. There were no hospitalizations, 
      intensive care unit admissions, or deaths in third-dose booster groups with 
      either BNT162b2 or CoronaVac, yielding 100% effectiveness. Both homologous or 
      heterologous third-dose boosters provided further protection against severe 
      COVID-19 and should be prioritized as an effective strategy to combat the 
      COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Immune correlates of protection by vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with 
      chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.
LID - 10.1111/bjh.18602 [doi]
AB  - In chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination 
      remains unclear as most studies have focused on humoral responses. Here we 
      comprehensively examined humoral and cellular responses to vaccine in CLL 
      patients. Seroconversion was observed in 55.2% of CLL with lower rate and 
      antibody titres in treated patients. T-cell responses were detected in a 
      significant fraction of patients. CD4(+) and CD8(+) frequencies were 
      significantly increased independent of serology with higher levels of CD4(+) 
      cells in patients under a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) or a B-cell lymphoma 2 
      (BCL-2) inhibitor. Vaccination skewed CD8(+) cells towards a highly cytotoxic 
      phenotype, more pronounced in seroconverted patients. A high proportion of 
      patients showed spike-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells producing interferon gamma 
      (IFNγ) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). Patients under a BTK inhibitor 
      showed increased production of IFNγ and TNFα by CD4(+) cells. Vaccination induced 
      a Th1 polarization reverting the Th2 CLL T-cell profile in the majority of 
      patients with lower IL-4 production in untreated and BTK-inhibitor-treated 
      patients. Such robust T-cell responses may have contributed to remarkable 
      protection against hospitalization and death in a cohort of 540 patients. 
      Combining T-cell metrics with seroprevalence may yield a more accurate measure of 
      population immunity in CLL, providing consequential insights for public health.

TI  - Association of a Third Dose of BNT162b2 Vaccine With Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 
      Infection Among Health Care Workers in Israel.
PG  - 341-349
LID - 10.1001/jama.2021.23641 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Administration of a BNT162b2 booster dose (Pfizer-BioNTech) to fully 
      vaccinated individuals aged 60 years and older was significantly associated with 
      lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe illness. Data are lacking on the 
      effectiveness of booster doses for younger individuals and health care workers. 
      OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association of a BNT162b2 booster dose with SARS-CoV-2 
      infections among health care workers who were previously vaccinated with a 2-dose 
      series of BNT162b2. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a prospective 
      cohort study conducted at a tertiary medical center in Tel Aviv, Israel. The 
      study cohort included 1928 immunocompetent health care workers who were 
      previously vaccinated with a 2-dose series of BNT162b2, and had enrolled between 
      August 8 and 19, 2021, with final follow-up reported through September 20, 2021. 
      Screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed every 14 days. Anti-spike 
      protein receptor binding domain IgG titers were determined at baseline and 1 
      month after enrollment. Cox regression with time-dependent analysis was used to 
      estimate hazard ratios of SARS-CoV-2 infection between booster-immunized status 
      and 2-dose vaccinated (booster-nonimmunized) status. EXPOSURES: Vaccination with 
      a booster dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary 
      outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, as confirmed by reverse 
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Among 1928 participants, the 
      median age was 44 years (IQR, 36-52 years) and 1381 were women (71.6%). 
      Participants completed the 2-dose vaccination series a median of 210 days (IQR, 
      205-213 days) before study enrollment. A total of 1650 participants (85.6%) 
      received the booster dose. During a median follow-up of 39 days (IQR, 35-41 
      days), SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 44 participants (incidence rate, 60.2 per 
      100 000 person-days); 31 (70.5%) were symptomatic. Five SARS-CoV-2 infections 
      occurred in booster-immunized participants and 39 in booster-nonimmunized 
      participants (incidence rate, 12.8 vs 116 per 100 000 person-days, respectively). 
      In a time-dependent Cox regression analysis, the adjusted hazard ratio of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection for booster-immunized vs booster-nonimmunized participants 
      was 0.07 (95% CI, 0.02-0.20). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among health care 
      workers at a single center in Israel who were previously vaccinated with a 2-dose 
      series of BNT162b2, administration of a booster dose compared with not receiving 
      one was associated with a significantly lower rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection over a 
      median of 39 days of follow-up. Ongoing surveillance is required to assess 
      durability of the findings.

TI  - Effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine Compared with Hybrid Immunity in 
      Populations Prioritized and Non-Prioritized for COVID-19 Vaccination in 
      2021-2022: A Naturalistic Case-Control Study in Sweden.
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10081273 [doi]
LID - 1273
AB  - The term hybrid immunity is used to denote the immunological status of vaccinated 
      individuals with a history of natural infection. Reports of new SARS-CoV-2 
      variants of concern motivate continuous rethought and renewal of COVID-19 
      vaccination programs. We used a naturalistic case-control study design to compare 
      the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to hybrid immunity 180 days 
      post-vaccination in prioritized and non-prioritized populations vaccinated before 
      31 July 2021 in three Swedish counties (total population 1,760,000). Subjects 
      with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test recorded within 6 months before vaccination (n = 
      36,247; 6%) were matched to vaccinated-only controls. In the prioritized 
      population exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Delta variants post-vaccination, 
      the odds ratio (OR) for breakthrough infection was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.6-2.8; p &lt; 
      0.001) in the vaccinated-only group compared with the hybrid immunity group, 
      while in the later vaccinated non-prioritized population, the OR decreased from 
      4.3 (95% CI, 2.2-8.6; p &lt; 0.001) during circulation of the Delta variant to 
      1.9 (95% CI, 1.7-2.1; p &lt; 0.001) with the introduction of the Omicron variant 
      (B.1.617.2). We conclude that hybrid immunity provides gains in protection, but 
      that the benefits are smaller for risk groups and with circulation of the Omicron 
      variant and its sublineages.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Critical questions remain about COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) 
      in real-world settings, particularly in middle-income countries. We describe a 
      study protocol to evaluate COVID-19 VE in preventing laboratory-confirmed 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in health workers (HWs) in Albania, an upper-middle-income 
      country. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this 12-month prospective cohort study, we 
      enrolled HWs at three hospitals in Albania. HWs are vaccinated through the 
      routine COVID-19 vaccine campaign. Participants completed a baseline survey about 
      demographics, clinical comorbidities, and infection risk behaviours. Baseline 
      serology samples were also collected and tested against the SARS-CoV-2 spike 
      protein, and respiratory swabs were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by 
      RT-PCR. Participants complete weekly symptom questionnaires and symptomatic 
      participants have a respiratory swab collected, which is tested for SARS-CoV-2. 
      At 3, 6, 9 months and 12 months of the study, serology will be collected and 
      tested for antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and spike 
      protein. VE will be estimated using a piecewise proportional hazards model 
      (VE=1-HR). BASELINE DATA: From February to May 2021, 1504 HWs were enrolled. The 
      median age was 44 (range: 22-71) and 78% were female. At enrolment, 72% of 
      participants were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. 56% of participants were 
      vaccinated with one dose, of whom 98% received their first shot within 4 days of 
      enrolment. All HWs received the Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: The study protocol and procedures were reviewed and approved by 
      the WHO Ethical Review Board, reference number CERC.0097A, and the Albanian 
      Institute of Public Health Ethical Review Board, reference number 156. All 
      participants have provided written informed consent to participate in this study. 
      The primary results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal at 
      the time of completion. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04811391.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccines have been crucial in the pandemic response and 
      understanding changes in vaccines effectiveness is essential to guide vaccine 
      policies. Although the Delta variant is no longer dominant, understanding vaccine 
      effectiveness properties will provide essential knowledge to comprehend the 
      development of the pandemic and estimate potential changes over time. METHODS: In 
      this population-based cohort study, we estimated the vaccine effectiveness of 
      Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech; BNT162b2), Spikevax (Moderna; mRNA-1273), Vaxzevria 
      (AstraZeneca; ChAdOx nCoV-19; AZD1222), or a combination against SARS-CoV-2 
      infections, hospitalisations, intensive care admissions, and death using Cox 
      proportional hazard models, across different vaccine product regimens and age 
      groups, between 15 July and 31 November 2021 (Delta variant period). Vaccine 
      status is included as a time-varying covariate and all models were adjusted for 
      age, sex, comorbidities, county of residence, country of birth, and living 
      conditions. Data from the entire adult Norwegian population were collated from 
      the National Preparedness Register for COVID-19 (Beredt C19). RESULTS: The 
      overall adjusted vaccine effectiveness against infection decreased from 81.3% 
      (confidence interval (CI): 80.7 to 81.9) in the first 2 to 9 weeks after 
      receiving a second dose to 8.6% (CI: 4.0 to 13.1) after more than 33 weeks, 
      compared to 98.6% (CI: 97.5 to 99.2) and 66.6% (CI: 57.9 to 73.6) against 
      hospitalisation respectively. After the third dose (booster), the effectiveness 
      was 75.9% (CI: 73.4 to 78.1) against infection and 95.0% (CI: 92.6 to 96.6) 
      against hospitalisation. Spikevax or a combination of mRNA products provided the 
      highest protection, but the vaccine effectiveness decreased with time since 
      vaccination for all vaccine regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the vaccine 
      effectiveness against infection waned over time, all vaccine regimens remained 
      effective against hospitalisation after the second vaccine dose. For all vaccine 
      regimens, a booster facilitated recovery of effectiveness. The results from this 
      support the use of heterologous schedules, increasing flexibility in vaccination 
      policy.

TI  - Clinical Effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 Booster Vaccine Against Omicron Infection in 
      Residents and Staff of Long-term Care Facilities: A Prospective Cohort Study 
      (VIVALDI).
PG  - ofac694
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofac694 [doi]
LID - ofac694
AB  - BACKGROUND: Successive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) variants have caused severe disease in long-term care facility 
      (LTCF) residents. Primary vaccination provides strong short-term protection, but 
      data are limited on duration of protection following booster vaccines, 
      particularly against the Omicron variant. We investigated the effectiveness of 
      booster vaccination against infections, hospitalizations, and deaths among LTCF 
      residents and staff in England. METHODS: We included residents and staff of LTCFs 
      within the VIVALDI study (ISRCTN 14447421) who underwent routine, asymptomatic 
      testing (December 12, 2021-March 31, 2022). Cox regression was used to estimate 
      relative hazards of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and associated hospitalization and 
      death at 0-13, 14-48, 49-83, 84-111, 112-139, and 140+ days after dose 3 of 
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccination compared with 2 doses (after 84+ days), stratified by 
      previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and adjusting for age, sex, LTCF capacity, and 
      local SARS-CoV-2 incidence. RESULTS: A total of 14 175 residents and 19 793 staff 
      were included. In residents without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, infection risk 
      was reduced 0-111 days after the first booster, but no protection was apparent 
      after 112 days. Additional protection following booster vaccination waned but was 
      still present at 140+ days for COVID-associated hospitalization (adjusted hazard 
      ratio [aHR], 0.20; 95% CI, 0.06-0.63) and death (aHR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.20-1.27). 
      Most residents (64.4%) had received primary course vaccine of AstraZeneca, but 
      this did not impact pre- or postbooster risk. Staff showed a similar pattern of 
      waning booster effectiveness against infection, with few hospitalizations and no 
      deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that booster vaccination provided 
      sustained protection against severe outcomes following infection with the Omicron 
      variant, but no protection against infection from 4 months onwards. Ongoing 
      surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in LTCFs is crucial.

TI  - COVID-19 vaccination among cirrhotics in Italy: High coverage and effectiveness 
      of 3 doses versus 2 in preventing breakthrough infection and hospitalization.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Few reports, all retrospective, have evaluated vaccine 
      coverage against COVID-19 infection in cirrhotic subjects. No data are available 
      for European Countries. We aimed to explore this topic and potential independent 
      predictors of lack of vaccination. METHODS: Between January 1st and June 30th 
      2022, 1512 cirrhotic subjects of any etiology were consecutively enrolled in an 
      observational - prospective study in 8 referral centers in Italy. Adjusted Odds 
      Ratios (O.R.) for the association with lack of vaccination and with occurrence of 
      breakthrough infection were evaluated by multiple logistic regression analysis. 
      RESULTS: Overall vaccine coverage was 89.7% (80% among people born abroad). Among 
      the 1358 vaccinated people, 178 (13.1%) had a breakthrough infection; of them 12 
      (6.7%) were hospitalized, but none died. Independent predictors associated with 
      lack of vaccination were birth abroad, age <65 years and lower years of 
      schooling. Child stage B/C was the only independent predictor of breakthrough 
      infection. Occurrence of breakthrough infection was more likely reported in 
      subjects who received 2 doses of vaccine than in those who received 3 doses 
      (33.9% versus 9.0%; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: High vaccine coverage against COVID-19 
      infection is observed among cirrhotic subjects in Italy. Vaccine is effective in 
      preventing severe outcomes. Three doses are more effective than two, even in 
      cirrhotic subjects. LAY SUMMARY: This large cohort study evidenced high vaccine 
      coverage against COVID-19 infection among cirrhotic subjects in a European 
      country and the effectiveness of vaccine in preventing severe outcomes. Three 
      doses of vaccine are more effective than two in preventing breakthrough infection 
      and hospitalization. Informative campaigns targeting people younger than 65 years 
      of age and those with lower years of schooling may increase these excellent 
      results.

TI  - The Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Primary Vaccination in a Cohort of Patients Hospitalized 
      for Acute COVID-19 during Delta Variant Predominance.
LID - 10.3390/jcm11051191 [doi]
LID - 1191
AB  - Vaccine breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections necessitating hospitalization have 
      emerged as a relevant problem with longer time interval since vaccination and the 
      predominance of the Delta variant. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
      association between primary vaccination with four SARS-CoV-2 vaccines authorized 
      for use in the European Union-BNT162b2, ChAdOx-1S, mRNA-1273 or Ad.26.COV2.S-and 
      progression to critically severe disease (mechanical ventilation or death) and 
      duration of hospitalization among adult patients with PCR-confirmed acute 
      COVID-19 hospitalized during the Delta variant predominance (October-November 
      2021) in Slovenia. Among the 529 enrolled patients hospitalized with COVID-19 
      (median age, 65 years; 58.2% men), 175 (33.1%) were fully vaccinated at the time 
      of symptom onset. Compared with 345 unvaccinated patients, fully vaccinated 
      patients with breakthrough infections were older, more often immunocompromised, 
      and had higher Charlson comorbidity index scores. After adjusting for sex, age, 
      and comorbidities, fully vaccinated patients had lower odds for progressing to 
      critically severe disease and were discharged from the hospital earlier than 
      unvaccinated patients. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 remains an extremely 
      effective intervention to alleviate morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients.

TI  - PICK-ing Malaysia's Epidemic Apart: Effectiveness of a Diverse COVID-19 Vaccine 
      Portfolio.
LID - 10.3390/vaccines9121381 [doi]
LID - 1381
AB  - Malaysia rolled out a diverse portfolio of predominantly three COVID-19 vaccines 
      (AZD1222, BNT162b2, and CoronaVac) beginning 24 February 2021. We evaluated 
      vaccine effectiveness with two methods, covering 1 April to 15 September 2021: 
      (1) the screening method for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and symptomatic 
      COVID-19; and (2) a retrospective cohort of confirmed COVID-19 cases for COVID-19 
      related ICU admission and death using logistic regression. The screening method 
      estimated partial vaccination to be 48.8% effective (95% CI: 46.8, 50.7) against 
      COVID-19 infection and 33.5% effective (95% CI: 31.6, 35.5) against symptomatic 
      COVID-19. Full vaccination is estimated at 87.8% effective (95% CI: 85.8, 89.7) 
      against COVID-19 infection and 85.4% effective (95% CI: 83.4, 87.3) against 
      symptomatic COVID-19. Among the cohort of confirmed COVID-19 cases, partial 
      vaccination with any of the three vaccines is estimated at 31.3% effective (95% 
      CI: 28.5, 34.1) in preventing ICU admission, and 45.1% effective (95% CI: 42.6, 
      47.5) in preventing death. Full vaccination with any of the three vaccines is 
      estimated at 79.1% effective (95% CI: 77.7, 80.4) in preventing ICU admission and 
      86.7% effective (95% CI: 85.7, 87.6) in preventing deaths. Our findings suggest 
      that full vaccination with any of the three predominant vaccines (AZD1222, 
      BNT162b2, and CoronaVac) in Malaysia has been highly effective in preventing 
      COVID-19 infection, symptomatic COVID-19, COVID-19-related ICU admission, and 
      death.

AB  - Given emerging evidence of immune escape in the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron viral variant, 
      and its dominance, effectiveness of heterologous and homologous boosting 
      schedules commonly used in low-to-middle income countries needs to be 
      re-evaluated. We conducted a test-negative design using consolidated national 
      administrative data in Malaysia to compare the effectiveness of homologous and 
      heterologous BNT162b2, CoronaVac, and AZD1222 booster vaccination against 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in predominant-Delta and predominant-Omicron periods. Across 
      both periods, homologous CoronaVac and AZD1222 boosting demonstrated lower 
      effectiveness than heterologous boosting for CoronaVac and AZD1222 primary 
      vaccination recipients and homologous BNT162b2 boosting. Broadly, marginal 
      effectiveness was smaller by 40-50 percentage points in the Omicron period than 
      the Delta period. Without effective and accessible second-generation vaccines, 
      heterologous boosting using BNT162b2 for inactivated and vectored primary 
      vaccination recipients is preferred.

AB  - We assessed the protection conferred by naturally-acquired, vaccine-induced and 
      hybrid immunity during the concomitant Omicron and Delta epidemic waves in France 
      on symptomatic infection and severe COVID-19. The greatest levels of protection 
      against both variants were provided by hybrid immunity. Protection against 
      Omicron symptomatic infections was systematically lower and waned at higher speed 
      than against Delta in those vaccinated. In contrast, there were little 
      differences in variant-specific protection against severe inpatient outcomes in 
      symptomatic individuals.

TI  - Vaccine effectiveness and duration of protection against symptomatic infections 
      and severe Covid-19 outcomes in adults aged 50 years and over, France, January to 
      mid-December 2021.
PG  - 100076
LID - 10.1016/j.gloepi.2022.100076 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread despite fast vaccine rollout, which 
      could be attributed to waning immunity or to a reduced protection against some 
      variants. A thorough characterization of vaccine protection and its duration in 
      time is needed to inform vaccination policies and enhance public trust. METHODS: 
      We linked three national databases with exhaustive information on screening, 
      vaccination and hospitalizations in France from January 1st to December 12, 2021. 
      We performed a two-step analysis to estimate vaccine effectiveness against severe 
      outcomes of Covid-19 (requiring hospitalization) in people aged 50 years or over, 
      combining: (i) a test-negative case-control design to assess vaccine 
      effectiveness against symptomatic infections; and (ii) a survival analysis to 
      assess the additional protection against severe outcomes (hospitalizations, ICU 
      admissions and inpatient deaths) in infected individuals. FINDINGS: We found a 
      high vaccine effectiveness in people aged 50 years or more, reaching 82% against 
      symptomatic infections and 94% against hospitalizations, after a full vaccination 
      scheme with the Covid-19 vaccines used in France.Vaccine effectiveness against 
      symptomatic infections decreased over time, dropping to 53% after six months, but 
      remained high against severe outcomes (90% after six months). The booster dose 
      allowed restoring protection levels above 90% against symptomatic infections. 
      Vaccine protection and its evolution in time, showed little difference against 
      the variants that circulated prior to December 2021 in France, including the 
      Delta variant. INTERPRETATION: Though vaccine immunity decreases over time, 
      vaccination remains crucial to provide individual protection against severe 
      outcomes requiring hospitalization. This decline can be reversed by the receipt 
      of a booster dose.

TI  - Association Between Immune Dysfunction and COVID-19 Breakthrough Infection After 
      SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in the US.
PG  - 153-162
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.7024 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Persons with immune dysfunction have a higher risk for severe 
      COVID-19 outcomes. However, these patients were largely excluded from SARS-CoV-2 
      vaccine clinical trials, creating a large evidence gap. OBJECTIVE: To identify 
      the incidence rate and incidence rate ratio (IRR) for COVID-19 breakthrough 
      infection after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among persons with or without immune 
      dysfunction. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study 
      analyzed data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a partnership 
      that developed a secure, centralized electronic medical record-based repository 
      of COVID-19 clinical data from academic medical centers across the US. Persons 
      who received at least 1 dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine between December 10, 2020, 
      and September 16, 2021, were included in the sample. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Vaccination, COVID-19 diagnosis, immune dysfunction diagnoses (ie, HIV infection, 
      multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, solid organ transplant, and bone marrow 
      transplantation), other comorbid conditions, and demographic data were accessed 
      through the N3C Data Enclave. Breakthrough infection was defined as a COVID-19 
      infection that was contracted on or after the 14th day of vaccination, and the 
      risk after full or partial vaccination was assessed for patients with or without 
      immune dysfunction using Poisson regression with robust SEs. Poisson regression 
      models were controlled for a study period (before or after [pre- or post-Delta 
      variant] June 20, 2021), full vaccination status, COVID-19 infection before 
      vaccination, demographic characteristics, geographic location, and comorbidity 
      burden. RESULTS: A total of 664 722 patients in the N3C sample were included. 
      These patients had a median (IQR) age of 51 (34-66) years and were predominantly 
      women (n = 378 307 [56.9%]). Overall, the incidence rate for COVID-19 
      breakthrough infection was 5.0 per 1000 person-months among fully vaccinated 
      persons but was higher after the Delta variant became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 
      strain (incidence rate before vs after June 20, 2021, 2.2 [95% CI, 2.2-2.2] vs 
      7.3 [95% CI, 7.3-7.4] per 1000 person-months). Compared with partial vaccination, 
      full vaccination was associated with a 28% reduced risk for breakthrough 
      infection (adjusted IRR [AIRR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.68-0.76). People with a 
      breakthrough infection after full vaccination were more likely to be older and 
      women. People with HIV infection (AIRR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.18-1.49), rheumatoid 
      arthritis (AIRR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.09-1.32), and solid organ transplant (AIRR, 
      2.16; 95% CI, 1.96-2.38) had a higher rate of breakthrough infection. CONCLUSIONS 
      AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that full vaccination was associated with 
      reduced risk of COVID-19 breakthrough infection, regardless of the immune status 
      of patients. Despite full vaccination, persons with immune dysfunction had 
      substantially higher risk for COVID-19 breakthrough infection than those without 
      such a condition. For persons with immune dysfunction, continued use of 
      nonpharmaceutical interventions (eg, mask wearing) and alternative vaccine 
      strategies (eg, additional doses or immunogenicity testing) are recommended even 
      after full vaccination.

TI  - Real-World Effectiveness of Mix-and-Match Vaccine Regimens against SARS-CoV-2 
      Delta Variant in Thailand: A Nationwide Test-Negative Matched Case-Control Study.
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10071080 [doi]
LID - 1080
AB  - The objective of this study is to explore the real-world effectiveness of various 
      vaccine regimens to tackle the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Delta variant in Thailand during September-December 
      2021. We applied a test-negative case control study, using nationwide records of 
      people tested for SARS-CoV-2. Each case was matched with two controls with 
      respect to age, detection date, and specimen collection site. A conditional 
      logistic regression was performed. Results were presented in the form vaccine 
      effectiveness (VE) and 95% confidence interval. A total of 1,460,458 observations 
      were analyzed. Overall, the two-dose heterologous prime-boost, ChAdOx1 + BNT162b2 
      and CoronaVac + BNT162b2, manifested the largest protection level (79.9% 
      (74.0-84.5%) and 74.7% (62.8-82.8%)) and remained stable over the whole study 
      course. The three-dose schedules (CoronaVac + CoronaVac + ChAdOx1, and CoronaVac 
      + CoronaVac + BNT162b2) expressed very high degree of VE estimate (above 80.0% at 
      any time interval). Concerning severe infection, almost all regimens displayed 
      very high VE estimate. For the two-dose schedules, heterologous prime-boost 
      regimens seemed to have slightly better protection for severe infection relative 
      to homologous regimens. Campaigns to expedite the rollout of third-dose booster 
      shot should be carried out. Heterologous prime-boost regimens should be 
      considered as an option to enhance protection for the entire population.

TI  - The Effect of COVID-19 Vaccination on Reducing the Risk of Infection, 
      Hospitalization, and Death in Isfahan Province, Iran.
PG  - 188-195

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing 
      infection, hospitalization, and mortality due to COVID-19 in Isfahan Province, 
      Iran. METHODS: Following a retrospective cohort design, data of all vaccinated 
      individuals since the rollout of vaccination of the general population are 
      analyzed, Mar 2020 to Aug 13, 2021. Moreover, the data of all non-vaccinated 
      people were collected by the census method for this period. The two groups were 
      compared concerning hospitalization and mortality using the Chi-square test. 
      Kaplan-Meyer was also used to calculate the median interval between receiving a 
      vaccine and outcome (hospitalization and death). RESULTS: Overall, 583434 people 
      have received a second dose of a vaccine from Mar 2020 to Aug 2021, which 74% 
      (n=433403) was Sinopharm, 18.2% (n=106027) AstraZeneca, 3.6% (n=21216) Sputnik, 
      and 3.9% (n=22,788) Barekat. In contrast, 2,551,140 people living in the Isfahan 
      Province did not receive a vaccine. The median interval between injection of the 
      first dose and the hospitalization for those who received Sinopharm, AstraZeneca, 
      Sputnik, and Barekat was 22, 61, 19, and 19 days, respectively. For unvaccinated 
      cases, the rates of infection, hospitalization, and mortality (per 1000 
      population) were 69.7, 12.1, and 1.04, respectively. In contrast, for vaccinated 
      individuals, these rates were 3.9, 1.08, and 0.09, two weeks after the second 
      dose, respectively. CONCLUSION: The highest and lowest reduction in relative risk 
      was for those who received AstraZeneca and Sputnik, respectively.

TI  - Low pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Finnish health care workers: a 
      prospective cohort study.
PG  - 448-454
LID - 10.1080/23744235.2022.2027008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health care workers are at risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
      Our aim was to study the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike protein 
      specific antibodies in health care workers with occupational exposure to COVID-19 
      in Turku, Finland, from May to December 2020. METHODS: Health care workers of 
      Turku University Hospital units caring for COVID-19 patients or handling clinical 
      SARS-CoV-2 samples were invited to participate in the study. The presence of 
      SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike protein specific IgG antibodies were analysed 
      with in-house enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: At study enrolment, only one of the 
      222 (0.5%) study participants was seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 protein specific 
      antibodies. Two additional study participants (2/222, 0.9%) seroconverted during 
      the follow-up. All these participants were diagnosed with a RT-PCR-positive 
      COVID-19 infection before turning seropositive. CONCLUSION: In our study 
      population, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity remained low. The absence 
      of seropositive cases without previous RT-PCR confirmed infections demonstrate 
      good access to diagnostics. In addition to high vaccine coverage, high standards 
      of infection prevention practices and use of standard personal protective 
      equipment seem sufficient in preventing occupational SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 
      setting with low number of circulating virus. However, it remains unclear whether 
      similar protective practices would also be effective against more transmissible 
      SARS-CoV-2 variants.

TI  - COVID-19 mRNA vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation and death in veterans 
      according to frailty status during the SARS-CoV-2 delta (B.1.617.2) variant surge 
      in the USA: a retrospective cohort study.
PG  - e589-e598
LID - 10.1016/S2666-7568(22)00166-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that COVID-19 vaccination is effective at 
      preventing infection and death in older populations. However, whether vaccination 
      effectiveness is reduced in patients with frailty is unclear. We aimed to compare 
      vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation and death after COVID-19 during the 
      surge of the delta (B.1.617.2) variant of SARS-CoV-2 according to patients' 
      frailty status. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used data derived 
      from the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities and the US Department 
      of Veterans Affairs (VA) COVID-19 Shared Data Resource, which contains 
      information from the VA National Surveillance Tool, death certificates, and 
      National Cemetery Administration. We included veterans aged 19 years or older who 
      tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR or antigen tests between July 25 and 
      Sept 30, 2021, with no record of a previous positive test. Deaths were identified 
      through VHA facilities, death certificates, and National Cemetery Administration 
      data available from VA databases. We also retrieved data including 
      sociodemographic characteristics, medical conditions diagnosed at baseline, 
      frailty score, and vaccination information. The primary outcomes were 
      COVID-19-associated hospitalisations and all-cause deaths at 30 days from testing 
      positive for SARS-CoV-2. The odds ratio (OR) for COVID-19-associated 
      hospitalisation and hazard ratio (HR) for death of vaccinated patients compared 
      with the unvaccinated patients were estimated according to frailty categories of 
      robust, pre-frail, or frail. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as 1 minus the 
      OR for COVID-19-associated hospitalisation, and 1 minus the HR for death. 
      FINDINGS: We identified 57 784 veterans (mean age 57·5 years [SD 16·7], 50 642 
      [87·6%] males, and 40 743 [70·5%] White people), of whom 28 497 (49·3%) were 
      categorised as robust, 16 737 (29·0%) as pre-frail, and 12 550 (21·7%) as frail. 
      There were 2577 all-cause deaths (676 [26·2%] in the vaccinated group and 1901 
      [73·8%] in the unvaccinated group), and 7857 COVID-19-associated hospitalisations 
      (2749 [35·0%] in the vaccinated group and 5108 [65·0%] in the unvaccinated group) 
      within 30 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Vaccine effectiveness against 
      COVID-19-associated hospitalisation within 30 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test 
      was 65% (95% CI 61-69) in the robust group, 54% (48-58) in the pre-frail group, 
      and 36% (30-42) in the frail group. By 30 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, the 
      vaccine effectiveness for all-cause death was 79% (95% CI 74-84) in the robust 
      group, 79% (75-83) in the pre-frail group, and 68% (63-71) in the frail group. 
      INTERPRETATION: Compared with non-frail patients (pre-frail and robust), those 
      with frailty had lower levels of vaccination protection against 
      COVID-19-associated hospitalisation and all-cause death. Future studies 
      investigating COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness should incorporate frailty 
      assessments and actively recruit older adults with frailty. FUNDING: Miami VA

LID - e063919
AB  - ObjectiveTwo COVID-19 outbreaks occurred in Henan province in early 2022-one was 
      a Delta variant outbreak and the other was an Omicron variant outbreak. COVID-19 
      vaccines used at the time of the outbreak were inactivated, 91.8%; protein 
      subunit, 7.5%; and adenovirus5-vectored, 0.7% vaccines. The outbreaks provided an 
      opportunity to evaluate variant-specific breakthrough infection rates and 
      relative protective effectiveness of homologous inactivated COVID-19 vaccine 
      booster doses against symptomatic infection and pneumonia. DESIGN: Retrospective 
      cohort study METHODS: We evaluated relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) with a 
      retrospective cohort study of close contacts of infected individuals using a 
      time-dependent Cox regression model. Demographic and epidemiologic data were 
      obtained from the local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; clinical and 
      laboratory data were obtained from COVID-19-designated hospitals. Vaccination 
      histories were obtained from the national COVID-19 vaccination dataset. All data 
      were linked by national identification number. RESULTS: Among 784 SARS-CoV-2 
      infections, 379 (48.3%) were caused by Delta and 405 (51.7%) were caused by 
      Omicron, with breakthrough rates of 9.9% and 17.8%, respectively. Breakthrough 
      rates among boosted individuals were 8.1% and 4.9%. Compared with subjects who 
      received primary vaccination series ≥180 days before infection, Cox regression 
      modelling showed that homologous inactivated booster vaccination was 
      statistically significantly associated with protection from symptomatic infection 
      caused by Omicron (rVE 59%; 95% CI 13% to 80%) and pneumonia caused by Delta (rVE 
      62%; 95% CI 34% to 77%) and Omicron (rVE 87%; 95% CI 3% to 98%). CONCLUSIONS: 
      COVID-19 vaccination in China provided good protection against symptomatic 
      COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonia caused by Delta and Omicron variants. Protection 
      declined 6 months after primary series vaccination but was restored by homologous 
      inactivated booster doses given 6 months after the primary series.

AB  - With the global expansion of the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Delta 
      (B.1.617.2) variant, we conducted a matched test-negative case-control study to 
      assess the real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccines against 
      infection with Delta in Qatar's population. BNT162b2 effectiveness against any, 
      symptomatic or asymptomatic, Delta infection was 45.3% (95% CI, 22.0-61.6%) ≥14 d 
      after the first vaccine dose, but only 51.9% (95% CI, 47.0-56.4%) ≥14 d after the 
      second dose, with 50% of fully vaccinated individuals receiving their second dose 
      before 11 May 2021. Corresponding mRNA-1273 effectiveness ≥14 d after the first 
      or second dose was 73.7% (95% CI, 58.1-83.5%) and 73.1% (95% CI, 67.5-77.8%), 
      respectively. Notably, effectiveness against Delta-induced severe, critical or 
      fatal disease was 93.4% (95% CI, 85.4-97.0%) for BNT162b2 and 96.1% (95% CI, 
      71.6-99.5%) for mRNA-1273 ≥ 14 d after the second dose. Our findings show robust 
      effectiveness for both BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 in preventing Delta hospitalization 
      and death in Qatar's population, despite lower effectiveness in preventing 
      infection, particularly for the BNT162b2 vaccine.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We compared the vaccine effectiveness over time of the primary series 
      and booster against infection and severe disease with the Delta, Omicron BA.1, 
      and BA.2 variants in Singapore, an Asian setting with high vaccination coverage. 
      METHODS: We conducted a test-negative case-control study on all adult residents 
      in Singapore who underwent PCR testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in acute hospitals. Individuals with a negative PCR 
      from 1 September, 2021, to 30 November, 2021, and 1 December, 2021, to 25 April, 
      2022, served as controls for the Delta and Omicron variants respectively, and 
      PCR-positive individuals within these two time periods served as cases. 
      Associations between vaccination status and SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe 
      disease with the Delta or Omicron variants were measured using Poisson 
      regressions. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated by taking 1 minus risk ratio. 
      RESULTS: There were 68 114 individuals comprising 58 495 controls and 9619 cases 
      for the Delta period, of whom 53 093 completed the primary series and 9161 were 
      boosted. For the Omicron period, 104 601 individuals comprising 80 428 controls, 
      8643 BA.1 cases, and 15 530 BA.2 cases were included, of whom 29 183 and 71 513 
      were vaccinated with the primary series and boosted, respectively. The primary 
      series provided greater protection against infection with Delta (45%, 95% CI 
      40-50%) than against infection with Omicron (21%, 95% CI 7-34% for BA.1; 18%, 95% 
      CI 6-29% for BA.2) at <2 months from vaccination. Vaccine effectiveness of the 
      booster was similar against infection with BA.1 (44%, 95% CI 38-50%) and BA.2 
      (40%, 95% CI 35-40%). Protection against severe disease by the booster for BA.1 
      (83%, 95% CI 76-88%) and BA.2 (78%, 95% CI 73-82%) was comparable to that by the 
      primary series for Delta (80%, 95% CI 73-85%). CONCLUSION: Our findings support 
      the use of a booster dose to reduce the risk of severe disease and mitigate the 
      impact on the healthcare system in an Omicron-predominant epidemic.

AB  - Vaccination has proven effective against infection with SARS-CoV-2, as well as 
      death and hospitalisation following COVID-19 illness. However, little is known 
      about the effect of vaccination on other acute and post-acute outcomes of 
      COVID-19. Data were obtained from the TriNetX electronic health records network 
      (over 81 million patients mostly in the USA). Using a retrospective cohort study 
      and time-to-event analysis, we compared the incidences of COVID-19 outcomes 
      between individuals who received a COVID-19 vaccine (approved for use in the USA) 
      at least 2 weeks before SARS-CoV-2 infection and propensity score-matched 
      individuals unvaccinated for COVID-19 but who had received an influenza vaccine. 
      Outcomes were ICD-10 codes representing documented COVID-19 sequelae in the 
      6 months after a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (recorded between January 1 and 
      August 31, 2021, i.e. before the emergence of the Omicron variant). Associations 
      with the number of vaccine doses (1 vs. 2) and age (<60 vs. ≥ 60 years-old) were 
      assessed. Among 10,024 vaccinated individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 9479 
      were matched to unvaccinated controls. Receiving at least one COVID-19 vaccine 
      dose was associated with a significantly lower risk of respiratory failure, ICU 
      admission, intubation/ventilation, hypoxaemia, oxygen requirement, 
      hypercoagulopathy/venous thromboembolism, seizures, psychotic disorder, and hair 
      loss (each as composite endpoints with death to account for competing risks; HR 
      0.70-0.83, Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05), but not other outcomes, including 
      long-COVID features, renal disease, mood, anxiety, and sleep disorders. Receiving 
      2 vaccine doses was associated with lower risks for most outcomes. Associations 
      between prior vaccination and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection were marked in 
      those <60 years-old, whereas no robust associations were observed in those 
      ≥60 years-old. In summary, COVID-19 vaccination is associated with lower risk of 
      several, but not all, COVID-19 sequelae in those with breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. The findings may inform service planning, contribute to forecasting 
      public health impacts of vaccination programmes, and highlight the need to 
      identify additional interventions for COVID-19 sequelae.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally, recommendations are expanding for third (booster) doses of 
      BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech). In the United States, as of November 19, 2021, 
      boosters were recommended for all adults aged 18 years and older. We evaluated 
      the effectiveness of a third dose of BNT162b2 among adults in a large US 
      integrated health system. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we 
      analyzed electronic health records from Kaiser Permanente Southern California 
      between Dec 14, 2020 and Dec 5, 2021 to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) of two 
      and three doses of BNT162b2 against SARS-CoV-2 infections (without hospital 
      admission) andCOVID-19-related hospital admission. VE was calculated using 
      hazards ratios from adjusted Cox models. FINDINGS: After only two doses, VE 
      against infection declined from 85% (95% CI 83-86) during the first month to 49% 
      (46-51) ≥ 7 months following vaccination. Overall VE against hospitalization was 
      90% (95% CI 86-92) within one month and did not wane, however, effectiveness 
      against hospitalization appeared to wane among immunocompromised individuals but 
      was not statistically significant (93% [72-98] at 1 month to 74% [45-88] after 
      ≥ 7 months; p=0·490). Three-dose VE (median follow-up 1·3 months [SD 0·6]) was 
      88% (95% CI 86-89) against infection and 97% (95-98) against hospitalization. 
      Effectiveness after three doses was higher than that seen one month after 
      receiving only two doses for both outcomes. Relative VE of three doses compared 
      to two (with at least six months after the second dose) was 75% (95% CI 71-78) 
      against infections and 70% (48-83) against hospital admissions. INTERPRETATION: 
      These data support the benefit of broad BNT162b2 booster recommendations, as 
      three doses confers comparable, if not better, protection against SARS-CoV-2 
      infections and hospital admission as was seen soon after receiving two doses.

      USA: a test-negative case-control study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The duration of protection against the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant 
      for current COVID-19 vaccines is not well characterised. Vaccine-specific 
      estimates are especially needed. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and 
      durability of two and three doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA vaccine 
      against hospital and emergency department admissions due to the delta (B.1.617.2) 
      and omicron variants. METHODS: In this case-control study with a test-negative 
      design, we analysed electronic health records of members of Kaiser Permanente 
      Southern California (KPSC), a large integrated health system in California, USA, 
      from Dec 1, 2021, to Feb 6, 2022. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated in KPSC 
      patients aged 18 years and older admitted to hospital or an emergency department 
      (without a subsequent hospital admission) with a diagnosis of acute respiratory 
      infection and tested for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 
      estimated with odds ratios from adjusted logistic regression models. This study 
      is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04848584). FINDINGS: Analyses were done 
      for 11 123 hospital or emergency department admissions. In adjusted analyses, 
      effectiveness of two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine against the omicron variant 
      was 41% (95% CI 21-55) against hospital admission and 31% (16-43) against 
      emergency department admission at 9 months or longer after the second dose. After 
      three doses, effectiveness of BNT162b2 against hospital admission due to the 
      omicron variant was 85% (95% CI 80-89) at less than 3 months but fell to 55% 
      (28-71) at 3 months or longer, although confidence intervals were wide for the 
      latter estimate. Against emergency department admission, the effectiveness of 
      three doses of BNT162b2 against the omicron variant was 77% (72-81) at less than 
      3 months but fell to 53% (36-66) at 3 months or longer. Trends in waning against 
      SARS-CoV-2 outcomes due to the delta variant were generally similar, but with 
      higher effectiveness estimates at each timepoint than those seen for the omicron 
      variant. INTERPRETATION: Three doses of BNT162b2 conferred high protection 
      against hospital and emergency department admission due to both the delta and 
      omicron variants in the first 3 months after vaccination. However, 3 months after 
      receipt of a third dose, waning was apparent against SARS-CoV-2 outcomes due to 
      the omicron variant, including hospital admission. Additional doses of current, 
      adapted, or novel COVD-19 vaccines might be needed to maintain high levels of 
      protection against subsequent waves of SARS-CoV-2 caused by the omicron variant 
      or future variants with similar escape potential. FUNDING: Pfizer.

TI  - Effectiveness Associated With BNT162b2 Vaccine Against Emergency Department and 
      Urgent Care Encounters for Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among 
      Adolescents Aged 12 to 17 Years.
PG  - e2225162

LID - e2225162
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Data about the duration of protection of 2 and 3 doses of BNT162b2 in 
      children and adolescents are needed to help inform recommendations for boosters 
      in this age group. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate vaccine effectiveness (VE) and 
      durability associated with 2 doses of BNT162b2 against Delta- and Omicron-related 
      emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) encounters among adolescents aged 
      12 to 17 years and to estimate VE associated with 3 doses against these same 
      outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This test-negative case-control 
      study was conducted at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, an integrated 
      health care system using electronic health records in the US. Participants 
      included Kaiser Permanente Southern California members ages 12 to 17 years with 
      an ED or UC encounter from November 1, 2021, through March 18, 2022, for acute 
      respiratory infection who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 via a reverse 
      transction-polymerase chain reaction test. Analyses were conducted from March 21 
      to June 22, 2022. EXPOSURES: BNT162b2 vaccination status ascertained from 
      electronic health records and state registry data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      The main outcome was VE associated with BNT162b2 against ED and UC encounters 
      related to Delta or Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Analyses were 
      conducted among 3168 adolescents, including 1004 with ED visits and 2164 with UC 
      visits. Median (IQR) age was 15 (13-16) years, and 1461 (46.1%) were boys. In 
      adjusted analyses, VE associated with 2 doses of BNT162b2 against ED or UC 
      encounters was highest within the first 2 months for both Delta (89% [95% CI, 69% 
      to 96%]) and Omicron (73% [95% CI, 54% to 84%]) variants but waned to 49% (95% 
      CI, 27% to 65%) for the Delta variant and 16% (95% CI, -7% to 34%) for the 
      Omicron variant at 6 months and beyond. A third dose of BNT162b2 was associated 
      with improved protection against the Omicron variant (87% [95% CI, 72% to 94%]) 
      after a median (IQR) of 19 (9-32) days after dose 3. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      These findings suggest that 2 doses of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine were 
      associated with high levels of protection against ED and UC encounters related to 
      the Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the first few months after 
      vaccination. However, effectiveness waned over time, especially against Omicron. 
      A third dose of BNT162b2 was associated with improved protection against Omicron 
      beyond that seen initially after 2 doses, underscoring the importance of boosters 
      for adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.

TI  - Effectiveness and durability of BNT162b2 vaccine against hospital and emergency 
      department admissions due to SARS-CoV-2 omicron sub-lineages BA.1 and BA.2 in a 
      large health system in the USA: a test-negative, case-control study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 omicron (B.1.1.529 BA.1) lineage was first detected in 
      November, 2021, and is associated with reduced vaccine effectiveness. By March, 
      2022, BA.1 had been replaced by sub-lineage BA.2 in the USA. As new variants 
      evolve, vaccine performance must be continually assessed. We aimed to evaluate 
      the effectiveness and durability of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) against hospital 
      and emergency department admissions for BA.1 and BA.2. METHODS: In this 
      test-negative, case-control study, we sourced data from the electronic health 
      records of adult (aged ≥18 years) members of Kaiser Permanente Southern 
      California (KPSC), which is a health-care system in the USA, who were admitted to 
      one of 15 KPSC hospitals or emergency departments (without subsequent 
      hospitalisation) between Dec 27, 2021, and June 4, 2022, with an acute 
      respiratory infection and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Omicron 
      sub-lineage was determined by use of sequencing, spike gene target failure, and 
      the predominance of variants in certain time periods. Our main outcome was the 
      effectiveness of two or three doses of BNT162b2 in preventing emergency 
      department or hospital admission. Variant-specific vaccine effectiveness was 
      evaluated by comparing the odds ratios from logistic regression models of 
      vaccination between test-positive cases and test-negative controls, adjusting for 
      the month of admission, age, sex, race and ethnicity, body-mass index, Charlson 
      Comorbidity Index, previous influenza or pneumococcal vaccines, and previous 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also assessed effectiveness by the time since 
      vaccination. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04848584, and is 
      ongoing. FINDINGS: Of 65 813 total admissions during the study period, we 
      included 16 994 in our analyses, of which 7435 were due to BA.1, 1056 were due to 
      BA.2, and 8503 were not due to SARS-CoV-2. In adjusted analyses, two-dose vaccine 
      effectiveness was 40% (95% CI 27 to 50) for hospitalisation and 29% (18 to 38) 
      for emergency department admission against BA.1 and 56% (31 to 72) for 
      hospitalisation and 16% (-5 to 33) for emergency department admission against 
      BA.2. Three-dose vaccine effectiveness was 79% (74 to 83) for hospitalisation and 
      72% (67 to 77) for emergency department admission against BA.1 and 71% (55 to 81) 
      for hospitalisation and 21% (1 to 37) for emergency department admission against 
      BA.2. Less than 3 months after the third dose, vaccine effectiveness was 80% (74 
      to 84) for hospitalisation and 74% (69 to 78) for emergency department admission 
      against BA.1. Vaccine effectiveness 3 months or more after the third dose was 76% 
      (69 to 82) against BA.1-related hospitalisation and 65% (56 to 73) against 
      BA.1-related emergency department admission. Against BA.2, vaccine effectiveness 
      was 74% (47 to 87) for hospitalisation and 59% (40 to 72) for emergency 
      department admission at less than 3 months after the third dose and 70% (53 to 
      81) for hospitalisation and 5% (-21 to 25) for emergency department admission at 
      3 months or more after the third dose. INTERPRETATION: Two doses of BNT162b2 
      provided only partial protection against BA.1-related and BA.2-related hospital 
      and emergency department admission, which underscores the need for booster doses 
      against omicron. Although three doses offered high levels of protection (≥70%) 
      against hospitalisation, variant-adapted vaccines are probably needed to improve 
      protection against less severe endpoints, like emergency department admission, 
      especially for BA.2. FUNDING: Pfizer.

PG  - 4890-4900
LID - 10.1002/jmv.27962 [doi]
AB  - To determine the safety and efficacy profile of teenager COVID-19 vaccination. In 
      this retrospective cohort study, contact numbers of parents of teenagers under 18 
      years of age referred to a teenager vaccination centers in Tehran-Iran to receive 
      the corona vaccine were collected, and the following information was obtained via 
      the phones: demographic information, type of vaccine, and the number of doses 
      received, as well as additional information like complications and required 
      treatments. Eleven thousand forty-two subjects aged 10-18 years, mean age 
      14.55 ± 1.83 year  including 5374 boys and 5768 girls were investigated. 88.1% 
      received the Sinopharm and 11.9% the Soberana vaccine. General side effects, 
      including fatigue, fever and chills, injection site pain and dizziness, and so 
      forth happened in 2978 cases; 7421 children presented with at least one general 
      or organ-specific side effect following vaccination, including potentially 
      critical side effects, such as vascular injuries, respiratory complication, and 
      so forth. 0.1% of the subject needed hospital admission. The breakthrough 
      infection happened in 200 individuals. Our study shows that Sinopharm and 
      Soberana (PastoCoVac) COVID-19 vaccines are generally safe with no serious side 
      effects in less than 18 years old. COVID-19 infection and reinfection can occur 
      after vaccination, but the incidence is actually tolerable and significantly 
      lower than in the unvaccinated group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Some studies have reported that influenza vaccination is associated 
      with lower risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      infection and/or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) morbidity and mortality. 
      This study aims to estimate effectiveness of influenza vaccination, using 
      Abbott's quadrivalent Influvac Tetra vaccine, against SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
      against severe COVID-19. METHODS: This matched, test-negative, case-control study 
      was implemented on a population of 30,774 healthcare workers (HCWs) in Qatar 
      during the 2020 annual influenza vaccination campaign, September 17, 
      2020-December 31, 2020, before introduction of COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: Of 
      30,774 HCWs, 576 with PCR-positive tests and 10,033 with exclusively PCR-negative 
      tests were eligible for inclusion in the study. Matching by sex, age, 
      nationality, reason for PCR testing, and PCR test date yielded 518 cases matched 
      to 2058 controls. Median duration between influenza vaccination and the PCR test 
      was 43 days (IQR, 29-62). Estimated effectiveness of influenza vaccination 
      against SARS-CoV-2 infection> 14 days after receiving the vaccine was 29.7% (95% 
      CI: 5.5-47.7%). Estimated effectiveness of influenza vaccination against severe, 
      critical, or fatal COVID-19 was 88.9% (95% CI: 4.1-98.7%). Sensitivity analyses 
      confirmed the main analysis results. CONCLUSIONS: Recent influenza vaccination is 
      associated with a significant reduction in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
      COVID-19 severity.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: A comprehensive understanding of the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination 
      requires consideration of disease attenuation, determined as whether people who 
      develop COVID-19 despite vaccination have lower disease severity than 
      unvaccinated people. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between vaccination 
      with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines-mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 
      (Pfizer-BioNTech)-and COVID-19 hospitalization, and, among patients hospitalized 
      with COVID-19, the association with progression to critical disease. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A US 21-site case-control analysis of 4513 adults 
      hospitalized between March 11 and August 15, 2021, with 28-day outcome data on 
      death and mechanical ventilation available for patients enrolled through July 14, 
      2021. Date of final follow-up was August 8, 2021. EXPOSURES: COVID-19 
      vaccination. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Associations were evaluated between 
      prior vaccination and (1) hospitalization for COVID-19, in which case patients 
      were those hospitalized for COVID-19 and control patients were those hospitalized 
      for an alternative diagnosis; and (2) disease progression among patients 
      hospitalized for COVID-19, in which cases and controls were COVID-19 patients 
      with and without progression to death or mechanical ventilation, respectively. 
      Associations were measured with multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 
      4513 patients (median age, 59 years [IQR, 45-69]; 2202 [48.8%] women; 23.0% 
      non-Hispanic Black individuals, 15.9% Hispanic individuals, and 20.1% with an 
      immunocompromising condition), 1983 were case patients with COVID-19 and 2530 
      were controls without COVID-19. Unvaccinated patients accounted for 84.2% 
      (1669/1983) of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Hospitalization for COVID-19 was 
      significantly associated with decreased likelihood of vaccination (cases, 15.8%; 
      controls, 54.8%; adjusted OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.13-0.18), including for sequenced 
      SARS-CoV-2 Alpha (8.7% vs 51.7%; aOR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.06-0.16) and Delta variants 
      (21.9% vs 61.8%; aOR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.10-0.21). This association was stronger for 
      immunocompetent patients (11.2% vs 53.5%; aOR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.09-0.13) than 
      immunocompromised patients (40.1% vs 58.8%; aOR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35-0.69) 
      (P < .001) and weaker at more than 120 days since vaccination with BNT162b2 (5.8% 
      vs 11.5%; aOR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.27-0.49) than with mRNA-1273 (1.9% vs 8.3%; aOR, 
      0.15; 95% CI, 0.09-0.23) (P < .001). Among 1197 patients hospitalized with 
      COVID-19, death or invasive mechanical ventilation by day 28 was associated with 
      decreased likelihood of vaccination (12.0% vs 24.7%; aOR, 0.33; 95% CI, 
      0.19-0.58). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine 
      was significantly less likely among patients with COVID-19 hospitalization and 
      disease progression to death or mechanical ventilation. These findings are 
      consistent with risk reduction among vaccine breakthrough infections compared 
      with absence of vaccination.

TI  - Effectiveness of mRNA Vaccination in Preventing COVID-19-Associated Invasive 
      Mechanical Ventilation and Death - United States, March 2021-January 2022.
PG  - 459-465
LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm7112e1 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] and mRNA-1273 [Moderna]) are 
      effective at preventing COVID-19-associated hospitalization (1-3). However, how 
      well mRNA vaccines protect against the most severe outcomes of these 
      hospitalizations, including invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death is 
      uncertain. Using a case-control design, mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) against 
      COVID-19-associated IMV and in-hospital death was evaluated among adults aged ≥18 
      years hospitalized at 21 U.S. medical centers during March 11, 2021-January 24, 
      2022. During this period, the most commonly circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2, 
      the virus that causes COVID-19, were B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617.2 (Delta), and 
      B.1.1.529 (Omicron). Previous vaccination (2 or 3 versus 0 vaccine doses before 
      illness onset) in prospectively enrolled COVID-19 case-patients who received IMV 
      or died within 28 days of hospitalization was compared with that among 
      hospitalized control patients without COVID-19. Among 1,440 COVID-19 
      case-patients who received IMV or died, 307 (21%) had received 2 or 3 vaccine 
      doses before illness onset. Among 6,104 control-patients, 4,020 (66%) had 
      received 2 or 3 vaccine doses. Among the 1,440 case-patients who received IMV or 
      died, those who were vaccinated were older (median age = 69 years), more likely 
      to be immunocompromised* (40%), and had more chronic medical conditions compared 
      with unvaccinated case-patients (median age = 55 years; immunocompromised = 10%; 
      p<0.001 for both). VE against IMV or in-hospital death was 90% (95% CI = 88%-91%) 
      overall, including 88% (95% CI = 86%-90%) for 2 doses and 94% (95% CI = 91%-96%) 
      for 3 doses, and 94% (95% CI = 88%-97%) for 3 doses during the 
      Omicron-predominant period. COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are highly effective in 
      preventing COVID-19-associated death and respiratory failure treated with IMV. 
      CDC recommends that all persons eligible for vaccination get vaccinated and stay 
      up to date with COVID-19 vaccination (4).

TI  - Vaccine effectiveness against influenza A(H3N2)-associated hospitalized illness, 
      United States, 2022.
LID - ciac869 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac869 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with historically low influenza 
      circulation during the 2020-2021 season, followed by increase in influenza 
      circulation during the 2021-2022 US season. The 2a.2 subgroup of the influenza 
      A(H3N2) 3C.2a1b subclade that predominated was antigenically different from the 
      vaccine strain. METHODS: To understand the effectiveness of the 2021-2022 vaccine 
      against hospitalized influenza illness, a multi-state sentinel surveillance 
      network enrolled adults aged ≥18 years hospitalized with acute respiratory 
      illness (ARI) and tested for influenza by a molecular assay. Using the 
      test-negative design, vaccine effectiveness (VE) was measured by comparing the 
      odds of current season influenza vaccination in influenza-positive case-patients 
      and influenza-negative, SARS-CoV-2-negative controls, adjusting for confounders. 
      A separate analysis was performed to illustrate bias introduced by including 
      SARS-CoV-2 positive controls. RESULTS: A total of 2334 patients, including 295 
      influenza cases (47% vaccinated), 1175 influenza- and SARS-CoV-2 negative 
      controls (53% vaccinated), and 864 influenza-negative and SARS-CoV-2 positive 
      controls (49% vaccinated), were analyzed. Influenza VE was 26% (95%CI: -14 to 
      52%) among adults aged 18-64 years, -3% (95%CI: -54 to 31%) among adults aged ≥65 
      years, and 50% (95%CI: 15 to 71%) among adults 18-64 years without 
      immunocompromising conditions. Estimated VE decreased with inclusion of 
      SARS-CoV-2-positive controls. CONCLUSIONS: During a season where influenza 
      A(H3N2) was antigenically different from the vaccine virus, vaccination was 
      associated with a reduced risk of influenza hospitalization in younger 
      immunocompetent adults. However, vaccination did not provide protection in adults 
      ≥65 years of age. Improvements in vaccines, antivirals, and prevention strategies 
      are warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) have threatened COVID-19 
      vaccine effectiveness. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of the ChAdOx1 
      nCoV-19 vaccine, predominantly against the delta (B.1.617.2) variant, in addition 
      to the cellular immune response to vaccination. METHODS: We did a test-negative, 
      case-control study at two medical research centres in Faridabad, India. All 
      individuals who had a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection between April 
      1, 2021, and May 31, 2021, were included as cases and individuals who had a 
      negative RT-PCR test were included as controls after matching with cases on 
      calendar week of RT-PCR test. The primary outcome was effectiveness of complete 
      vaccination with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against laboratory-confirmed 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. The secondary outcomes were effectiveness of a single dose 
      against SARS-CoV-2 infection and effectiveness of a single dose and complete 
      vaccination against moderate-to-severe disease among infected individuals. 
      Additionally, we tested in-vitro live-virus neutralisation and T-cell immune 
      responses to the spike protein of the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and VOCs among healthy 
      (anti-nucleocapsid antibody negative) recipients of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. 
      FINDINGS: Of 2379 cases of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 85 (3·6%) were fully 
      vaccinated compared with 168 (8·5%) of 1981 controls (adjusted OR [aOR] 0·37 [95% 
      CI 0·28-0·48]), giving a vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection of 
      63·1% (95% CI 51·5-72·1). 157 (6·4%) of 2451 of cases and 181 (9·1%) of 1994) 
      controls had received a single dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (aOR 0·54 [95% 
      CI 0·42-0·68]), thus vaccine effectiveness of a single dose against SARS-CoV-2 
      infection was 46·2% (95% CI 31·6-57·7). One of 84 cases with moderate-to-severe 
      COVID-19 was fully vaccinated compared with 84 of 2295 cases with mild COVID-19 
      (aOR 0·19 [95% CI 0·01-0·90]), giving a vaccine effectiveness of complete 
      vaccination against moderate-to-severe disease of 81·5% (95% CI 9·9-99·0). The 
      effectiveness of a single dose against moderate-to-severe disease was 79·2% (95% 
      CI 46·1-94·0); four of 87 individuals with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 had 
      received a single dose compared with 153 of 2364 participants with mild disease 
      (aOR 0·20 [95% CI 0·06-0·54]). Among 49 healthy, fully vaccinated individuals, 
      neutralising antibody responses were lower against the alpha (B.1.1.7; geometric 
      mean titre 244·7 [95% CI 151·8-394·4]), beta (B.1.351; 97·6 [61·2-155·8]), kappa 
      (B.1.617.1; 112·8 [72·7-175·0]), and delta (88·4 [61·2-127·8]) variants than 
      against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (599·4 [376·9-953·2]). However, the antigen-specific 
      CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses were conserved against both the delta variant and 
      wild-type SARS-CoV-2. INTERPRETATION: The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine remained 
      effective against moderate-to-severe COVID-19, even during a surge that was 
      dominated by the highly transmissible delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. Spike-specific 
      T-cell responses were maintained against the delta variant. Such cellular immune 
      protection might compensate for waning humoral immunity. FUNDING: Department of

      follow-up until May 9, 2022, reported. EXPOSURES: SARS-CoV-2 lineage (origin

      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical outcomes included presence of symptoms, specific 
      symptoms (including fever or chills), illness duration, and medical care seeking. 
      Virologic outcomes included viral load by quantitative reverse 
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing along with viral viability. 
      RESULTS: Among 1199 participants with COVID-19 infection (714 [59.5%] women; 
      median age, 41 years), 14.0% were infected with the origin strain, 24.0% with the 
      Delta variant, and 62.0% with the Omicron variant. Participants vaccinated with 
      the second vaccine dose 14 to 149 days before Delta infection were significantly 
      less likely to be symptomatic compared with unvaccinated participants (21/27 
      [77.8%] vs 74/77 [96.1%]; OR, 0.13 [95% CI, 0-0.6]) and, when symptomatic, those 
      vaccinated with the third dose 7 to 149 days before infection were significantly 
      less likely to report fever or chills (5/13 [38.5%] vs 62/73 [84.9%]; OR, 0.07 
      [95% CI, 0.0-0.3]) and reported significantly fewer days of symptoms (10.2 vs 
      16.4; difference, -6.1 [95% CI, -11.8 to -0.4] days). Among those with Omicron 
      infection, the risk of symptomatic infection did not differ significantly for the 
      2-dose vaccination status vs unvaccinated status and was significantly higher for 
      the 3-dose recipients vs those who were unvaccinated (327/370 [88.4%] vs 85/107 
      [79.4%]; OR, 2.0 [95% CI, 1.1-3.5]). Among symptomatic Omicron infections, those 
      vaccinated with the third dose 7 to 149 days before infection compared with those 
      who were unvaccinated were significantly less likely to report fever or chills 
      (160/311 [51.5%] vs 64/81 [79.0%]; OR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.1-0.5]) or seek medical 
      care (45/308 [14.6%] vs 20/81 [24.7%]; OR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.2-0.9]). Participants 
      with Delta and Omicron infections who received the second dose 14 to 149 days 
      before infection had a significantly lower mean viral load compared with 
      unvaccinated participants (3 vs 4.1 log10 copies/μL; difference, -1.0 [95% CI, 
      -1.7 to -0.2] for Delta and 2.8 vs 3.5 log10 copies/μL, difference, -1.0 [95% CI, 
      -1.7 to -0.3] for Omicron). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a cohort of US 
      essential and frontline workers with SARS-CoV-2 infections, recent vaccination 
      with 2 or 3 mRNA vaccine doses less than 150 days before infection with Delta or 
      Omicron variants, compared with being unvaccinated, was associated with 
      attenuated symptoms, duration of illness, medical care seeking, or viral load for 
      some comparisons, although the precision and statistical significance of specific 
      estimates varied.

TI  - Humoral immunoresponse elicited against an adenoviral-based SARS-CoV-2 
      coronavirus vaccine in elderly patients.
PG  - 7193-7205
LID - 10.18632/aging.204299 [doi]
AB  - The early sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome allowed for a speedy 
      development of effective vaccines against the virus. Nevertheless, age-related 
      immunosenescence, the inability to mount strong immune responses, still 
      represents a major obstacle. Here, in a group of 149 elderly volunteers (70-96 
      years old), evolution of the humoral immune response over time to Gam-COVID-Vac 
      (Sputnik V), a vaccine based on heterologous recombinant adenovirus-26 (Ad26) and 
      adenovirus-5 (Ad5) carrying the Spike genome, was analyzed by an anti-RBD ELISA. 
      At 28 days post vaccination (dpv), a seroconversion rate of 91% was achieved, 
      showing the importance of administering at least two doses of Gam-COVID-Vac to 
      elicit a robust immune response, especially in elderly individuals without 
      previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, IgG specific antibodies that 
      reached their highest titers around 28 dpv (median = 740), persisted without 
      significant decrease after 60 dpv (median = 650). After 90 dpv, IgG titers began 
      to drop, and at 180 dpv only 44.7% of the elderly individuals remained with 
      detectable anti-RBD IgG antibodies. No significant differences were observed in 
      specific humoral immune responses between genders at early times point. However, 
      at 60 dpv anti-RBD titers were more persistent in elderly females, and only 
      dropped at 90 dpv (p < 0.0001). As expected, the highest antibodies titers were 
      elicited in the youngest subgroup (70-74 years). Our results show that 
      Gam-COVID-Vac was able to deal with the ageing of the immune system, eliciting a 
      robust immune response in an elderly cohort, which lasted approximately 90 dpv at 
      high levels, and protected against COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk of experiencing a systemic adverse event (AE) after mRNA 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination may be greater among persons with 
      a history of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      infection; data on serious events are limited. We assessed if adults reporting 
      systemic AEs resulting in emergency department visits or hospitalizations during 
      days 0-7 after mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose 1 were more likely to have a history of 
      prior SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with persons who reported no or non-severe 
      systemic AEs. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study using v-safe 
      surveillance data. Participants were ≥ 18 years and received dose 1 during 
      December 14, 2020─May 9, 2021. Cases reported severe systemic AEs 0-7 days after 
      vaccination. Three controls were frequency matched per case by age, vaccination 
      date, and days since vaccination. Follow-up surveys collected SARS-CoV-2 
      histories. RESULTS: Follow-up survey response rates were 38.6 % (potential cases) 
      and 56.8 % (potential controls). In multivariable analyses including 3,862 
      case-patients and 11,586 controls, the odds of experiencing a severe systemic AE 
      were 2.4 (Moderna, mRNA-1273; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.89, 3.09) and 1.5 
      (Pfizer-BioNTech, BNT162b2; 95 % CI: 1.17, 2.02) times higher among participants 
      with pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 histories compared with those without. Medical 
      attention of any kind for symptoms during days 0-7 following dose 2 was not 
      common among case-patients or controls. CONCLUSIONS: History of SARS-CoV-2 
      infection was significantly associated with severe systemic AEs following dose 1 
      of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine; the effect varied by vaccine received. Most 
      participants who experienced severe systemic AEs following dose 1 did not require 
      medical attention of any kind for symptoms following dose 2. Vaccine providers 
      can use these findings to counsel patients who had pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 
      infection histories, experienced severe systemic AEs following dose 1, and are 
      considering not receiving additional mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses.

TI  - Clinical Efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 2176-2185
LID - 10.1016/j.ekir.2022.07.007 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health problem. Patients 
      with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis are at a higher risk of infection 
      and mortality than the general population. Worldwide, a vaccination campaign has 
      been developed that has been shown to reduce severe infections and deaths in the 
      general population. However, there are currently limited data on the clinical 
      efficacy of vaccinations in the hemodialysis population. METHODS: A national 
      multicenter observational cohort was performed in Chile to evaluate the clinical 
      efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in end-stage renal disease patients on 
      chronic hemodialysis from February 2021 to August 2021. In addition, the BNT162b2 
      (Pfizer-BioNTech) and CoronaVac (Sinovac) vaccines were evaluated. The efficacy 
      of vaccination in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalizations, and deaths 
      associated with COVID-19 was determined. RESULTS: A total of 12,301 patients were 
      evaluated; 10,615 (86.3%) received a complete vaccination (2 doses), 490 (4.0%) 
      received incomplete vaccination, and 1196 (9.7%) were not vaccinated. During 
      follow-up, 1362 (11.0%) patients developed COVID-19, and 150 died (case fatality 
      rate: 11.0%). The efficacy of the complete vaccination in preventing infection 
      was 18.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]:11.8-23.8%), and prevention of death was 
      66.0% (95% CI:60.6-70.7%). When comparing both vaccines, BNT162b2 and CoronaVac 
      were effective in reducing infection and deaths associated with COVID-19. 
      Nevertheless, the BNT162b2 vaccine had higher efficacy in preventing infection 
      (42.6% vs. 15.0%) and deaths (90.4% vs. 64.8%) compared to CoronaVac. CONCLUSION: 
      The results of our study suggest that vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in patients 
      on chronic hemodialysis was effective in preventing infection and death 
      associated with COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare prevalence of skin, nose and gingival bleedings after 
      receipt of adeno-vectored or mRNA-vaccines against COVID-19. The hypothesis is 
      that milder symptoms indicating altered thrombocyte function may affect a larger 
      proportion of vaccinated individuals than the recently reported severe cases with 
      thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. METHODS: Using an ongoing large, 
      population-based cohort study, more than 80000 cohort participants were asked 
      through electronic questionnaires about COVID-19 vaccination and potential side 
      effects during weeks 11-13, 2021. The response rate was 58% (81267/138924). Among 
      the vaccinated, 83% were female, 85% health care workers and 80% were aged 
      40-55 years. The prevalence of self-reported episodes of skin, nose and gingival 
      bleedings were compared after mRNA and adenovirus-vectored vaccination. Estimates 
      were adjusted for age, sex, occupation, previous COVID-19 infection and chronic 
      disease. RESULTS: Four of the 3416 subjects (0.2%) who were vaccinated with a 
      single dose of mRNA vaccine reported skin bleeding as a side effect, as opposed 
      to 163 of 5132 subjects (3.2%) vaccinated with a single dose of the 
      adenovirus-vectored vaccine, OR (odds ratio) = 16.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) 
      7.5-34.1). Corresponding ORs for nose and gingival bleeding were 8.0 (4.0-15.8) 
      and 9.3 (4.3-20.0), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings could potentially 
      indicate that the adenovirus-vectored vaccine may lead to mild bleeding episodes 
      in a larger proportion of vaccinated individuals, and not only in rare cases with 
      documented thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. Studies are needed to understand the 
      possible mechanisms behind these observations, and to establish or refute whether 
      they share similarities with the severe thromboembolic bleeding complications.

TI  - Effectiveness of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccination against asymptomatic 
      and symptomatic infection of SARS-CoV-2 omicron BA.2 in Hong Kong: a prospective 
      cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccines provide protection against symptomatic infection 
      that might require medical attention and against severe outcomes; however, there 
      is a paucity of evidence regarding the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and 
      CoronaVac vaccines and their booster regimens against asymptomatic or mild 
      omicron infections in the community. We aimed to measure the effectiveness of 
      BNT162b2 and CoronaVac vaccines against asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 
      omicron infections, during a period of omicron BA.2 predominance in Hong Kong. 
      METHODS: In this prospective cohort study in a population that was generally 
      infection-naive before the large omicron BA.2 wave between January and late May, 
      2022, we established a public health surveillance platform to monitor the 
      evolving activity of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the community. We recruited a 
      cohort of individuals aged 5 years and older between March 1 and March 7, 2022, 
      from the general population. Individuals were enrolled from all 18 districts of 
      Hong Kong, according to a predefined age-stratified quota, primarily by random 
      digit dialing (generating suitable eight-digit local telephone numbers by 
      randomly picking sets of the first four digits from a sampling frame, and 
      randomly generating the last four digits), and supplemented by our existing 
      cohorts (which included cohorts for studying influenza vaccination from 
      school-based vaccination programmes and cohorts for SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence 
      from the community), to ensure representativeness of the population in Hong Kong. 
      Participants did weekly rapid antigen testing with a self-collected pooled nasal 
      and throat swab, regardless of symptom and exposure status, from March 1 to April 
      15, 2022. Individuals reporting a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by 
      laboratory PCR testing before enrolment were excluded from the vaccine 
      effectiveness analysis to avoid potential bias due to infection-induced immunity. 
      The primary outcomes of the study were the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
      including asymptomatic and symptomatic infections, and the vaccine effectiveness 
      of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac vaccines. The effectiveness of one, two, and three 
      doses of vaccination was estimated with a Cox proportional hazards regression 
      model with time-dependent covariates, allowing for changes in vaccination status 
      over time, after adjustment for demographic factors and pre-existing medical 
      conditions. FINDINGS: Of the 8636 individuals included in the analysis, 7233 
      (84%) received at least two doses of vaccine, 3993 (46%) received booster doses, 
      and 903 (10%) reported SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among these infections 589 (65·2%) 
      were symptomatic and 314 (34·8%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing. 
      Statistically significant protection against asymptomatic and symptomatic 
      SARS-CoV-2 omicron infection was found only for those who received a BNT162b2 or 
      CoronaVac booster dose, with a vaccine effectiveness of 41·4% (23·2 to 55·2; 
      p=0·0001) and 32·4% (9·0 to 49·8; p=0·0098), respectively. The vaccine 
      effectiveness of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac boosters was further increased to 50·9% 
      (95% CI 31·0-65·0; p<0·0001) and 41·6% (15·0-59·8; p=0·0049), respectively, for 
      symptomatic omicron infections. A similar pattern of vaccine effectiveness 
      (55·8%, 22·9-74·6; p=0·0040) was also conferred after receipt of a BNT162b2 
      booster by individuals who received a CoronaVac primary vaccination series. 
      INTERPRETATION: Two doses of either vaccine did not provide significant 
      protection against COVID-19 infection. However, receipt of a BNT162b2 booster or 
      CoronaVac booster was associated with a significantly lower risk of omicron BA.2 
      infection and symptomatic infection. Our findings confirm the effectiveness of 
      booster doses to protect against mild and asymptomatic infection. FUNDING: Henry

TI  - First and second doses of Covishield vaccine provided high level of protection 
      against SARS-CoV-2 infection in highly transmissible settings: results from a 
      prospective cohort of participants residing in congregate facilities in India.

LID - e008271
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of Covishield vaccine 
      among residents of congregate residential facilities. DESIGN: A prospective 
      cohort study in congregate residential facilities. SETTING: Dharamshala, Himachal 
      Pradesh, India, from December 2020 to July 2021. PARTICIPANTS: Residents of all 
      ages in seven facilities-three monasteries, two old age homes and two learning 
      centres-were enrolled. EXPOSURES: First and second doses of Covishield vaccine 
      against SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Primary outcome was 
      development of COVID-19. Secondary outcome was unfavourable outcomes, defined as 
      a composite of shortness of breath, hospitalisation or death. Vaccine 
      effectiveness (%) was calculated as (1-HR)×100. RESULTS: There were 1114 
      residents (median age 31 years) participating in the study, 82% males. 
      Twenty-eight per cent (n=308/1114) were unvaccinated, 50% (n=554/1114) had 
      received one dose and 23% (n=252/1114) had received two doses of Covishield. The 
      point prevalence of COVID-19 for the facilities ranged from 11% to 57%. Incidence 
      rates (95% CI) of COVID-19 were 76 (63 to 90)/1000 person-months in the 
      unvaccinated, 25 (18 to 35)/1000 person-months in recipients of one dose and 9 (4 
      to 19)/1000 person-months in recipients of two doses. The effectiveness of first 
      and second doses of Covishield were 71% (adjusted HR (aHR) 0.29; 95% CI 0.18 to 
      0.46; p<0.001) and 80% (aHR 0.20; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.44; p<0.001), respectively, 
      against SARS-CoV-2 infection and 86% (aHR 0.24; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.82; p=0.023) and 
      99% (aHR 0.01; 95% CI 0.002 to 0.10; p<0.001), respectively, against unfavourable 
      outcome. The effectiveness was higher after 14 days of receiving the first and 
      second doses, 93% and 98%, respectively. Risk of infection was higher in persons 
      with chronic hepatitis B (aHR 1.78; p=0.034) and previous history of tuberculosis 
      (aHR 1.62; p=0.047). CONCLUSION: Covishield was effective in preventing 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and reducing disease severity in highly transmissible 
      settings during the second wave of the pandemic driven by the Delta variant.

TI  - Evaluating clinical effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in solid organ transplant 
      recipients: A propensity score matched analysis.
PG  - e13876
LID - 10.1111/tid.13876 [doi]
LID - e13876
AB  - BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) are at disproportionate 
      risk for severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Vaccination is a key 
      preventative strategy but is associated with decreased humoral responses among 
      SOTR. Whether dampened immune responses correlate with reduced clinical 
      effectiveness is unclear. Our study was designed to evaluate the clinical 
      effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the early vaccine era. METHODS: We 
      conducted a retrospective cohort study comparing SARS-CoV-2 infection rates 
      between SOTRs who received two doses of mRNA or one dose of Ad26.Cov2.S vaccine 
      and those not fully vaccinated (partially vaccinated and unvaccinated). To 
      evaluate clinical effectiveness of vaccine, cause-specific Cox regression model 
      and modified Poisson regression model were built using the propensity 
      score-matched cohort. Additionally, the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 of fully 
      vaccinated and not fully vaccinated SOTR were compared. RESULTS: Of 2705 SOTRs, 
      1668 were included in our final matched analysis, which showed a 73% reduction of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and 76% reduction of all-cause-mortality among fully 
      vaccinated patients. Thirty-nine SOTRs developed SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 
      nine fully vaccinated and 30 not fully vaccinated. Among fully vaccinated 
      patients, 22% had severe/critical COVID-19 and 0% mortality versus not fully 
      vaccinated SOTRs, of whom 37% had severe/critical COVID-19 and 6.67% 
      COVID-19-related mortality. CONCLUSION: In SOTRs, completion of primary vaccine 
      series in the early vaccine era was associated with a significant reduction of 
      COVID-19 and was protective against severe/critical disease and death. Further 
      studies are needed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of current vaccine 
      recommendations for SOTR against emerging new variants.

TI  - COVID-19 Vaccine in Inherited Metabolic Disorders Patients: A Cross-Sectional 
      Study on Rate of Acceptance, Safety Profile and Effect on Disease.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph191912227 [doi]
LID - 12227
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaccines for COVID-19 have had a significant impact on the spread of 
      COVID-19 infection, reducing the incidence and mortality of the infection in 
      several countries. However, hesitancy toward this vaccine is a global health 
      issue for the general population The Vaccine acceptance rate among patients 
      affected with inherited metabolic disorders (IMD), as well as safety profile, has 
      not been described. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study, based on a 
      telephone survey, investigating the COVID-19 vaccination rate, the incidence and 
      type of adverse effects (AEs), the reasons for vaccine refusal and the effects on 
      the underlying disease in a cohort of IMD patients followed at a single center 
      and invited directly to vaccination by specialistic team. RESULTS: Seventy-four 
      patients were included in the study, the median age was 23.4 years (min 12.1-max 
      61.7), 47% (n = 85) were females and 61% (107) were affected from impaired 
      metabolism of phenylalanine. By October 2021, 94% (n = 163) of them had received 
      at least one dose of the vaccine, which was, in 98% of cases, mRNA-based vaccine, 
      given at the referral hospital in 65% of cases. Overall, 72% of patients with IMD 
      reported AE to the vaccine: 60% after the first dose, 81% after the second. The 
      highest rate of adverse events at the first dose was reported in patients with 
      amino acids related disorders other than impaired phenylalanine metabolism 
      (PKU/HPA) (88%). For the second dose, the PKU/HPA group reported the highest rate 
      of AEs (89% of cases). There was no effect on the underlying disease or acute 
      decompensation after the vaccine. Eleven patients (6%) were not vaccinated 
      because they considered it dangerous. CONCLUSION: Among individuals with IMD, the 
      vaccination rate was high, the incidence and severity of AEs were comparable to 
      those in the general population with no effects on the disease. Direct contact 
      with the specialist medical team, has proven to reassure patients and effectively 
      contrast hesitancy.

TI  - Comparison of test-negative and syndrome-negative controls in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine 
      effectiveness evaluations for preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations in the United 
      States.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Test-negative design (TND) studies have produced validated estimates 
      of vaccine effectiveness (VE) for influenza vaccine studies. However, 
      syndrome-negative controls have been proposed for differentiating bias and true 
      estimates in VE evaluations for COVID-19. To understand the use of alternative 
      control groups, we compared characteristics and VE estimates of syndrome-negative 
      and test-negative VE controls. METHODS: Adults hospitalized at 21 medical centers 
      in 18 states March 11-August 31, 2021 were eligible for analysis. Case patients 
      had symptomatic acute respiratory infection (ARI) and tested positive for 
      SARS-CoV-2. Control groups were test-negative patients with ARI but negative 
      SARS-CoV-2 testing, and syndrome-negative controls were without ARI and negative 
      SARS-CoV-2 testing. Chi square and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to detect 
      differences in baseline characteristics. VE against COVID-19 hospitalization was 
      calculated using logistic regression comparing adjusted odds of prior mRNA 
      vaccination between cases hospitalized with COVID-19 and each control group. 
      RESULTS: 5811 adults (2726 cases, 1696 test-negative controls, and 1389 
      syndrome-negative controls) were included. Control groups differed across 
      characteristics including age, race/ethnicity, employment, previous 
      hospitalizations, medical conditions, and immunosuppression. However, 
      control-group-specific VE estimates were very similar. Among immunocompetent 
      patients aged 18-64 years, VE was 93 % (95 % CI: 90-94) using syndrome-negative 
      controls and 91 % (95 % CI: 88-93) using test-negative controls. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Despite demographic and clinical differences between control groups, the use of 
      either control group produced similar VE estimates across age groups and 
      immunosuppression status. These findings support the use of test-negative 
      controls and increase confidence in COVID-19 VE estimates produced by 
      test-negative design studies.

AB  - Patients with chronic kidney disease on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have a very 
      high risk of death in the course of COVID-19. The aim of the study was to assess 
      the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 and 
      the fatality rate in HD patients. A retrospective registry-based cohort study was 
      performed in all HD adult patients in the Pomeranian Voivodeship. Vaccinations 
      were carried out from January to April 2021 with mRNA vaccines, either BNT162b2 
      or mRNA-1273 with two-dose schedule. In the first analysis (2nd pandemic wave), 
      1,160 unvaccinated patients were included (59.7% males, 25.7% diabetic). In the 
      second analysis (4th pandemic wave), 1,131 (59.4% male, 30.7% diabetic) 
      individuals were included, 1,042 (92.13%) were fully vaccinated. Three hundred 
      and fifteen HD patients (27.2%) were COVID-19 positive during the 2nd wave, and 
      6.9% (78/1,131) during the 4th wave. Within the fully vaccinated patients of the 
      4th wave, 60 were COVID-19 positive, 5.8 vs. 20.2% of unvaccinated COVID-19 
      positive patients in 2nd wave, respectively. COVID-19 incidence rate ratio (IRR) 
      was 0.21 (4th wave-vaccinated vs. 2nd wave-unvaccinated) indicating a 79% 
      reduction. The IRR between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients of the 4th wave 
      was 0.28 in favor of vaccinated patients with 72% reduction. In the 2nd wave, 93 
      patients died as a result of COVID-19 (fatality rate: 29.5%). The fatality rate 
      of fully vaccinated patients during the 4th wave was 6.7% (p = 0.004), while the 
      fatality rate in the 4th wave within unvaccinated patients accounted for 11.1%. 
      Significant clinical effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination was demonstrated in a 
      multicenter study in HD patients.

TI  - Non-Pharmacological Preventive Measures Had an Impact on COVID-19 in Healthcare 
      Workers before the Vaccination Effect: A Cohort Study.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19063628 [doi]
LID - 3628
AB  - Healthcare workers have been and still are at the forefront of COVID-19 patient 
      care. Their infection had direct implications and caused important challenges for 
      healthcare performance. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of 
      non-pharmacological preventive measures against COVID-19 among healthcare 
      workers. This study is based on a dynamic cohort of healthcare workers (n = 5543) 
      who had been hired by a Spanish hospital for at least one week during 2020. 
      Negative binomial regression models were used to estimate the incidence rate and 
      the rate ratio (RR) between the two waves (defined from 15 March to 21 June and 
      from 22 June to 31 December), considering natural immunity during the first wave 
      and contextual variables. All models were stratified by socio-occupational 
      variables. The average COVID-19 incidence rate per 1000 worker-days showed a 
      significant reduction between the two waves, dropping from 0.82 (CI95%: 
      0.73-0.91) to 0.39 (0.35-0.44). The adjusted RR was 0.54 (0.48-0.87) when natural 
      immunity was acquired during the first wave, and contextual variables were 
      considered. The significant reduction of the COVID-19 incidence rate could be 
      explained mainly by improvement in the non-pharmacological preventive 
      interventions. It is needed to identify which measures were more effective. Young 
      workers and those with a replacement contract were identified as vulnerable 
      groups that need greater preventive efforts. Future preparedness plans would 
      benefit from these results.

LID - 812
AB  - COVID-19 vaccines have achieved a significant reduction in mortality, yet 
      objective estimates are needed in specific settings. We aimed to determine the 
      effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination at a referral hospital in Lambayeque, Peru. 
      We conducted a retrospective cohort study from February to September 2021. We 
      included hospitalized patients with COVID-19, whose data were stored in NotiWeb, 
      a patient data system of the Peruvian Ministry of Health. We applied a propensity 
      score-weighting method according to baseline characteristics of patients, and 
      estimated hazard ratios (HR) using Cox regression models. Of 1553 participants, 
      the average age was 55 years (SD: 16.8), 907 (58%) were male, and 592 (38%) 
      deceased at 28-day follow-up. Before hospital admission, 74 (4.8%) had been 
      immunized with at least one vaccine dose. Effectiveness against death in 
      vaccinated patients was 50% at 90-day follow-up (weighted HR 0.50, 95% CI 
      0.28-0.89). Our results support the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination against 
      death and provide information after early immunization in Peru.

AB  - BackgroundDifferential SARS-CoV-2 exposure between vaccinated and unvaccinated 
      individuals may confound vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates.AimWe conducted a 
      test-negative case-control study to determine VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
      the presence of confounding by SARS-CoV-2 exposure.MethodsWe included adults 
      tested for SARS-CoV-2 at community facilities between 4 July and 8 December 2021 
      (circulation period of the Delta variant). The VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      after primary vaccination with an mRNA (Comirnaty or Spikevax) or vector-based 
      vaccine (Vaxzevria or Janssen) was calculated using logistic regression adjusting 
      for age, sex and calendar week (Model 1). We additionally adjusted for 
      comorbidity and education level (Model 2) and SARS-CoV-2 exposure (number of 
      close contacts, visiting busy locations, household size, face mask wearing, 
      contact with SARS-CoV-2 case; Model 3). We stratified by age, vaccine type and 
      time since vaccination.ResultsVE against infection (Model 3) was 64% (95% CI: 
      50-73), only slightly lower than in Models 1 (68%; 95% CI: 58-76) and 2 (67%; 95% 
      CI: 56-75). Estimates stratified by age group, vaccine and time since vaccination 
      remained similar: mRNA VE (Model 3) among people ≥ 50 years decreased 
      significantly (p = 0.01) from 81% (95% CI: 66-91) at < 120 days to 61% (95% CI: 
      22-80) at ≥ 120 days after vaccination. It decreased from 83% to 59% in Model 1 
      and from 81% to 56% in Model 2.ConclusionSARS-CoV-2 exposure did not majorly 
      confound the estimated COVID-19 VE against infection, suggesting that VE can be 
      estimated accurately using routinely collected data without exposure information.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaccine hesitancy causes serious difficulties in vaccination 
      campaigns in many countries. The study of the population's attitude toward 
      vaccination and detection of the predictive important individual psychological 
      and social factors defining the vaccination necessity perception will allow 
      elaborating promoting vaccination adherence measures. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this 
      research was to study COVID-19 threat appraisal, fear of COVID-19, trust in 
      COVID-19 information sources, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, and the relationship 
      of sociodemographic variables to COVID-19 preventive behavior. METHODS: We 
      carried out a cohort cross-sectional study of the population's attitude toward 
      vaccination against the novel COVID-19 coronavirus infection, using a specially 
      designed questionnaire for an online survey. Totally, there were 4,977 
      respondents, ranging in age from 18 to 81 years. Statistical assessment was 
      carried out using the SPSS-11 program. RESULTS: There were different attitudes 
      toward vaccination. Among respondents, 34.2% considered vaccination to be useful, 
      31.1% doubted its effectiveness, and 9.9% considered vaccination unnecessary. The 
      survey indicated that 7.4% of respondents were indifferent to the vaccine, while 
      12.2% deemed it to be dangerous. Nearly one-third (32.3%) of respondents 
      indicated that they did not plan to be vaccinated, while another third (34.0%) 
      would postpone their decision until more comprehensive data on the results and 
      effectiveness of vaccination were available. Only 11.6% of the respondents were 
      vaccinated at the time of the study. Young people were less focused on 
      vaccination compared to middle-aged and elderly people. Receiving information 
      concerning COVID-19 vaccination from healthcare workers and scientific experts 
      was associated with greater vaccination acceptance. CONCLUSION: The study results 
      showed that vaccination attitudes interacted with individuals' mental health and 
      various sociodemographic factors. Insofar as reports of physicians and experts 
      are essential for shaping attitudes to vaccination, the study results inform the 
      selection of target groups in need of particular psychosocial interventions to 
      overcome their vaccine hesitancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is one of the most common diseases and causes of death in 
      calves during the first month of life. Pre-calving vaccination programme (PVP) 
      against the most common diarrhea-causing pathogens could help to avoid this 
      threat if hyperimmune transition milk (TM) is fed to calves throughout the whole 
      susceptibility period. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to reveal 
      the implementation practices of PVPs in large commercial dairy farms and to 
      compare calf-level mortality hazards during the first year of vaccination (V+ 
      period) and a year before implementing the vaccination programme (V- period). A 
      questionnaire was filled out in 15 large-scale dairy farms in Estonia that used 
      PVP. The farms were assigned into three groups based on compliance with the 
      vaccine directions for use and TM feeding practices. Calf-level time-to-event 
      data was analyzed with an observation period of 21 days and on-farm mortality due 
      to diarrhea being the event of interest. RESULTS: During the V+ period, a 
      significant decline in diarrhea-induced calf mortality was identified in three 
      out of six herds that followed vaccination instructions and fed TM for at least 
      14 days. On average, calf mortality hazard due to diarrhea decreased among these 
      herds (hazard rate ratio (HR) = 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63; 0.81). 
      In the group of correctly vaccinating herds where TM was fed for less than 14 
      days, diarrhea-induced calf mortality decreased in two herds and remained 
      unchanged in two herds with average diarrhea-induced calf mortality hazard 
      declining significantly during the vaccination period (HR = 0.24, 95% CI 0.14; 
      0.41). Among the three farms that deviated from the vaccination instructions, the 
      average calf mortality hazard increased in the V+ period (HR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.21; 
      2.14). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that implementing a PVP might aid to 
      reduce diarrhea-induced calf mortality in large commercial dairy farms. There is 
      a need to increase veterinarians´ and farmers´ awareness about the importance of 
      including pregnant heifers into the vaccination programme and emphasize the 
      importance of prolonged feeding of hyperimmune TM to calves.

TI  - Real-world serological responses to extended-interval and heterologous COVID-19 
      mRNA vaccination in frail, older people (UNCoVER): an interim report from a 
      prospective observational cohort study.
PG  - e166-e175
LID - 10.1016/S2666-7568(22)00012-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of COVID-19 vaccines has been prioritised to protect the most 
      vulnerable-notably, older people. Because of fluctuations in vaccine 
      availability, strategies such as delayed second dose and heterologous prime-boost 
      have been used. However, the effectiveness of these strategies in frail, older 
      people are unknown. We aimed to assess the antigenicity of mRNA-based COVID-19 
      vaccines in frail, older people in a real-world setting, with a rationed interval 
      dosing of 16 weeks between the prime and boost doses. METHODS: This prospective 
      observational cohort study was done across 12 long-term care facilities of the 
      Montréal Centre-Sud - Integrated University Health and Social Services Centre in 
      Montréal, Québec, Canada. Under a rationing strategy mandated by the provincial 
      government, adults aged 65 years and older residing in long-term care facilities 
      in Québec, Canada, with or without previously documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
      were administered homologous or heterologous mRNA vaccines, with an extended 
      16-week interval between doses. All older residents in participating long-term 
      care facilities who received two vaccine doses were eligible for inclusion in 
      this study. Participants were enrolled from Dec 31, 2020, to Feb 16, 2021, and 
      data were collected up to June 9, 2021. Clinical data and blood samples were 
      serially collected from participants at the following timepoints: at baseline, 
      before the first dose; 4 weeks after the first dose; 6-10 weeks after the first 
      dose; 16 weeks after the first dose, up to 2 days before administration of the 
      second dose; and 4 weeks after the second dose. Sera were tested for 
      SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies (to the trimeric spike protein, the 
      receptor-binding domain [RBD] of the spike protein, and the nucleocapsid protein) 
      by automated chemiluminescent ELISA. Two cohorts were used in this study: a 
      discovery cohort, for which blood samples were collected before administration of 
      the first vaccine dose and longitudinally thereafter; and a confirmatory cohort, 
      for which blood samples were only collected from 4 weeks after the prime dose. 
      Analyses were done in the discovery cohort, with validation in the confirmatory 
      cohort, when applicable. FINDINGS: The total study sample consisted of 185 
      participants. 65 participants received two doses of mRNA-1273 (Spikevax; 
      Moderna), 36 received two doses of BNT162b2 (Comirnaty; Pfizer-BioNTech), and 84 
      received mRNA-1273 followed by BNT162b2. In the discovery cohort, after a 
      significant increase in anti-RBD and anti-spike IgG concentrations 4 weeks after 
      the prime dose (from 4·86 log binding antibody units [BAU]/mL to 8·53 log BAU/mL 
      for anti-RBD IgG and from 5·21 log BAU/mL to 8·05 log BAU/mL for anti-spike IgG), 
      there was a significant decline in anti-RBD and anti-spike IgG concentrations 
      until the boost dose (7·10 log BAU/mL for anti-RBD IgG and 7·60 log BAU/mL for 
      anti-spike IgG), followed by an increase 4 weeks later for both vaccines (9·58 
      log BAU/mL for anti-RBD IgG and 9·23 log BAU/mL for anti-spike IgG). 
      SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals showed lower antibody responses than previously 
      infected individuals at all timepoints tested up to 16 weeks after the prime 
      dose, but achieved similar antibody responses to previously infected participants 
      by 4 weeks after the second dose. Individuals primed with the BNT162b2 vaccine 
      showed a larger decrease in mean anti-RBD and anti-spike IgG concentrations with 
      a 16-week interval between doses (from 8·12 log BAU/mL to 4·25 log BAU/mL for 
      anti-RBD IgG responses and from 8·18 log BAU/mL to 6·66 log BAU/mL for anti-spike 
      IgG responses) than did those who received the mRNA-1273 vaccine (two doses of 
      mRNA-1273: from 8·06 log BAU/mL to 7·49 log BAU/mL for anti-RBD IgG responses and 
      from 6·82 log BAU/mL to 7·56 log BAU/mL for anti-spike IgG responses; mRNA-1273 
      followed by BNT162b2: from 8·83 log BAU/mL to 7·95 log BAU/mL for anti-RBD IgG 
      responses and from 8·50 log BAU/mL to 7·97 log BAU/mL for anti-spike IgG 
      responses). No differences in antibody responses 4 weeks after the second dose 
      were noted between the two vaccines, in either homologous or heterologous 
      combinations. INTERPRETATION: Interim results of this ongoing longitudinal study 
      show that among frail, older people, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and the type 
      of mRNA vaccine influenced antibody responses when used with a 16-week interval 
      between doses. In these cohorts of frail, older individuals with a similar age 
      and comorbidity distribution, we found that serological responses were similar 
      and clinically equivalent between the discovery and confirmatory cohorts. 
      Homologous and heterologous use of mRNA vaccines was not associated with 
      significant differences in antibody responses 4 weeks following the second dose, 
      supporting their interchangeability. FUNDING: Public Health Agency of Canada,

AB  - BACKGROUND: In late 2021, the pandemic wave was dominated by the Delta SARS-CoV-2 
      variant in Hungary. Booster vaccines were offered for the vulnerable population 
      starting from August 2021. METHODS: The nationwide HUN-VE 3 study examined the 
      effectiveness and durability of primary immunization and single booster 
      vaccinations in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, Covid-19 related 
      hospitalization and mortality during the Delta wave, compared to an unvaccinated 
      control population without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The study 
      population included 8,087,988 individuals who were 18-100 years old at the 
      beginning of the pandemic. During the Delta wave, after adjusting for age, sex, 
      calendar day, and chronic diseases, vaccine effectiveness (VE) of primary 
      vaccination against registered SARS-CoV-2 infection was between 11% to 77% and 
      18% to 79% 14-120 days after primary immunization in the 16-64 and 65-100 years 
      age cohort respectively, while it decreased to close to zero in the younger age 
      group and around 40% or somewhat less in the elderly after 6 months for almost 
      all vaccine types. In the population aged 65-100 years, we found high, 
      88.1%-92.5% adjusted effectiveness against Covid-19 infection after the 
      Pfizer-BioNTech, and 92.2%-95.6% after the Moderna booster dose, while Sinopharm 
      and Janssen booster doses provided 26.5%-75.3% and 72.9%-100.0% adjusted VE, 
      respectively. Adjusted VE against Covid-19 related hospitalization was high 
      within 14-120 days for Pfizer-BioNTech: 76.6%, Moderna: 83.8%, Sputnik-V: 78.3%, 
      AstraZeneca: 73.8%, while modest for Sinopharm: 45.7% and Janssen: 26.4%. The 
      waning of protection against Covid-19 related hospitalization was modest and 
      booster vaccination with mRNA vaccines or the Janssen vaccine increased adjusted 
      VE up to almost 100%, while the Sinopharm booster dose proved to be less 
      effective. VE against Covid-19 related death after primary immunization was high 
      or moderate: for Pfizer-BioNTech: 81.5%, Moderna: 93.2%, Sputnik-V: 100.0%, 
      AstraZeneca: 84.8%, Sinopharm: 58.6%, Janssen: 53.3%). VE against this outcome 
      also showed a moderate decline over time, while booster vaccine types restored 
      effectiveness up to almost 100%, except for the Sinopharm booster. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The HUN-VE 3 study demonstrated waning VE with all vaccine types for all examined 
      outcomes during the Delta wave and confirmed the outstanding benefit of booster 
      vaccination with the mRNA or Janssen vaccines, and this is the first study to 
      provide clear and comparable effectiveness results for six different vaccine 
      types after primary immunization against severe during the Delta pandemic wave.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal maternal physiological changes may cause severe COVID-19 
      among pregnant women. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 mRNA) has 
      been shown to be highly effective and it is recommended for individuals aged 
      ≥16 years, including pregnant women, although the vaccine has not been tested on 
      the latter. OBJECTIVE: To study the association between prenatal Pfizer-BioNTech 
      COVID-19 vaccination, pregnancy course and outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: A 
      retrospective cohort study was performed, including all women who delivered 
      between January and June 2021 at Soroka University Medical Center, the largest 
      birth center in Israel. Excluded were women diagnosed with COVID-19 in the past, 
      multiple gestations or unknown vaccination status. Pregnancy, delivery and 
      newborn complications were compared between women who received 1 or 2-dose 
      vaccines during pregnancy and unvaccinated women. Multivariable models were used 
      to adjust for background characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 4,399 women 
      participated in this study, 913 (20.8%) of which were vaccinated during 
      pregnancy. All vaccinations occurred during second or third trimesters. As 
      compared to the unvaccinated women, vaccinated women were older, more likely to 
      conceive following fertility treatments, to have sufficient prenatal care, and of 
      higher socioeconomic position. In both crude and multivariable analyses, no 
      differences were found between the groups in pregnancy, delivery and newborn 
      complications, including gestational age at delivery, incidence of small for 
      gestational age and newborn respiratory complications. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal 
      maternal COVID-19 vaccine has no adverse effects on pregnancy course and 
      outcomes. These findings may help pregnant women and health care providers to 
      make informed decision regarding vaccination.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Understanding the effectiveness and durability of protection 
      against SARS-CoV-2 infection conferred by previous infection and COVID-19 is 
      essential to inform ongoing management of the pandemic. This study aims to 
      determine whether prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccination in 
      healthcare workers protects against future infection. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This 
      is a prospective cohort study design in staff members working in hospitals in the 
      UK. At enrolment, participants are allocated into cohorts, positive or naïve, 
      dependent on their prior SARS-CoV-2 infection status, as measured by standardised 
      SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing on all baseline serum samples and previous SARS-CoV-2 
      test results. Participants undergo monthly antibody testing and fortnightly viral 
      RNA testing during follow-up and based on these results may move between cohorts. 
      Any results from testing undertaken for other reasons (eg, symptoms, contact 
      tracing) or prior to study entry will also be captured. Individuals complete 
      enrolment and fortnightly questionnaires on exposures, symptoms and vaccination. 
      Follow-up is 12 months from study entry, with an option to extend follow-up to 24 
      months.The primary outcome of interest is infection with SARS-CoV-2 after 
      previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccination during the study period. 
      Secondary outcomes include incidence and prevalence (both RNA and antibody) of 
      SARS-CoV-2, viral genomics, viral culture, symptom history and 
      antibody/neutralising antibody titres. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was 
      approved by the Berkshire Research Ethics Committee, Health Research Authority 
      (IRAS ID 284460, REC reference 20/SC/0230) on 22 May 2020; the vaccine amendment 
      was approved on 12 January 2021. Participants gave informed consent before taking 
      part in the study.Regular reports to national and international expert advisory 
      groups and peer-reviewed publications ensure timely dissemination of findings to 
      inform decision making. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN11041050.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A programme of vaccination with the four-component serogroup B 
      meningococcal (4CMenB) vaccine was introduced in South Australia for infants and 
      children aged 0-3 years on Oct 1, 2018, and for senior school students in school 
      years 10 and 11 (aged 15-16 years) and young adults aged 17-20 years on Feb 1, 
      2019. We aimed to evaluate vaccine effectiveness and impact on serogroup B 
      meningococcal disease and gonorrhoea 2 years after implementation of the 
      programme. METHODS: We did a cohort and case-control study among those targeted 
      by the South Australia 4CMenB vaccination programme. We obtained disease 
      notification data from SA Health, Government of South Australia, and vaccine 
      coverage data from the South Australian records of the Australian Immunisation 
      Register. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as the reduction in the odds of 
      infection using the screening and case-control methods. Vaccine impact was 
      estimated as incidence rate ratios (IRRs), obtained by comparing case numbers in 
      each year following the start of the vaccination programme with cases in the 
      equivalent age cohort during the pre-vaccination programme years. We used Poisson 
      or negative binomial models, as appropriate, with adjustment for changes in the 
      incidence of serogroup B meningococcal disease in age cohorts not eligible for 
      vaccination through the state programme. FINDINGS: 4CMenB vaccine coverage 2 
      years after introduction of the childhood vaccination programme was 94·9% (33 357 
      of 35 144 eligible individuals) for one dose, 91·4% (26 443 of 28 922) for two 
      doses, and 79·4% (15 440 of 19 436) for three doses in infants. The one-dose 
      (77·1%, 16 422 of 21 305) and two-dose (69·0%, 14 704 of 21 305) coverage was 
      highest in adolescents born in 2003 (approximately year 10 students). 2 years 
      after implementation of the childhood vaccination programme, incidence of 
      serogroup B meningococcal disease was significantly reduced compared with before 
      programme implementation in infants aged 12 weeks to 11 months (adjusted IRR 
      [aIRR] 0·40 [95% CI 0·23-0·69], p=0·0011), but not in those aged 1 year (0·79 
      [0·16-3·87], p=0·77), 2 years (0·75 [0·18-3·14], p=0·70), or 4 years (3·00 
      [0·47-18·79], p=0·24). aIRRs were not calculable in those aged 3 or 5 years 
      because of no cases occurring after programme implementation. aIRR for serogroup 
      B meningococcal disease was 0·27 (0·06-1·16, p=0·078) in adolescents aged 15-18 
      years 2 years after implementation of the adolescent and young adult programme, 
      and 1·20 (0·70-2·06, p=0·51) in those aged 19-21 years in the first year. 
      Two-dose vaccine effectiveness against serogroup B meningococcal disease was 
      estimated to be 94·2% (95% CI 36·6-99·5) using the screening method and 94·7% 
      (40·3-99·5) using the case-control method in children, and 100% in adolescents 
      and young adults (no cases reported after implementation). Estimated two-dose 
      vaccine effectiveness against gonorrhoea in adolescents and young adults was 
      32·7% (8·3-50·6) based on the case-control method using age-matched individuals 
      with chlamydia infection as controls. INTERPRETATION: 4CMenB vaccine shows 
      sustained effectiveness against serogroup B meningococcal disease 2 years after 
      introduction in infants and adolescents, and moderate effectiveness against 
      gonorrhoea in adolescents. The high vaccine effectiveness against serogroup B 
      meningococcal disease is likely due to high coverage in the target age groups and 
      close antigenic match between the 4CMenB vaccine and the disease-associated 
      serogroup B meningococcal strains circulating in South Australia. 
      COVID-19-related physical distancing policies might have contributed to further 
      declines in serogroup B meningococcal disease cases during the programme's second 
      year. FUNDING: SA Health, Government of South Australia.

TI  - Ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 vaccine uptake and comparison to seasonal 
      influenza vaccine uptake in Greater Manchester, UK: A cohort study.
PG  - e1003932
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1003932 [doi]
LID - e1003932
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccine uptake is lower amongst most minority ethnic groups 
      compared to the White British group in England, despite higher COVID-19 mortality 
      rates. Here, we add to existing evidence by estimating inequalities for 16 
      minority ethnic groups, examining ethnic inequalities within population 
      subgroups, and comparing the magnitudes of ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 
      vaccine uptake to those for routine seasonal influenza vaccine uptake. METHODS 
      AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Greater 
      Manchester Care Record, which contains de-identified electronic health record 
      data for the population of Greater Manchester, England. We used Cox proportional 
      hazards models to estimate ethnic inequalities in time to COVID-19 vaccination 
      amongst people eligible for vaccination on health or age (50+ years) criteria 
      between 1 December 2020 and 18 April 2021 (138 days of follow-up). We included 
      vaccination with any approved COVID-19 vaccine, and analysed first-dose 
      vaccination only. We compared inequalities between COVID-19 and influenza vaccine 
      uptake adjusting by age group and clinical risk, and used subgroup analysis to 
      identify populations where inequalities were widest. The majority of individuals 
      (871,231; 79.24%) were White British. The largest minority ethnic groups were 
      Pakistani (50,268; 4.75%), 'other White background' (43,195; 3.93%), 'other 
      ethnic group' (34,568; 3.14%), and Black African (18,802; 1.71%). In total, 
      83.64% (919,636/1,099,503) of eligible individuals received a COVID-19 vaccine. 
      Uptake was lower compared to the White British group for 15 of 16 minority ethnic 
      groups, with particularly wide inequalities amongst the groups 'other Black 
      background' (hazard ratio [HR] 0.42, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.44), Black African (HR 
      0.43, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.44), Arab (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.48), and Black 
      Caribbean (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.45). In total, 55.71% (419,314/752,715) of 
      eligible individuals took up influenza vaccination. Compared to the White British 
      group, inequalities in influenza vaccine uptake were widest amongst the groups 
      'White and Black Caribbean' (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.68) and 'White and Black 
      African' (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.72). In contrast, uptake was slightly higher 
      than the White British group amongst the groups 'other ethnic group' (HR 1.11, 
      95% CI 1.09 to 1.12) and Bangladeshi (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.11). Overall, 
      ethnic inequalities in vaccine uptake were wider for COVID-19 than influenza 
      vaccination for 15 of 16 minority ethnic groups. COVID-19 vaccine uptake 
      inequalities also existed amongst individuals who previously took up influenza 
      vaccination. Ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 vaccine uptake were concentrated 
      amongst older and extremely clinically vulnerable adults, and the most 
      income-deprived. A limitation of this study is the focus on uptake of the first 
      dose of COVID-19 vaccination, rather than full COVID-19 vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 vaccine uptake exceeded those for influenza 
      vaccine uptake, existed amongst those recently vaccinated against influenza, and 
      were widest amongst those with greatest COVID-19 risk. This suggests the COVID-19 
      vaccination programme has created additional and different inequalities beyond 
      pre-existing health inequalities. We suggest that further research and policy 
      action is needed to understand and remove barriers to vaccine uptake, and to 
      build trust and confidence amongst minority ethnic communities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination is 
      recommended for all individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including 
      those on immunosuppressive therapies; however, little is known about vaccine 
      safety and efficacy in these patients or the impact of vaccination on IBD disease 
      course. METHODS: We evaluated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine-related 
      adverse events (AEs) and the effect of vaccination on IBD disease course among 
      participants in the PREVENT-COVID (Partnership to Report Effectiveness of 
      Vaccination in populations Excluded from iNitial Trials of COVID) study, a 
      prospective, observational cohort study. Localized and systemic reactions were 
      assessed via questionnaire. Disease flare was defined by worsening IBD symptoms 
      and change in IBD medications. Outcomes were stratified by vaccine type and IBD 
      medication classes. RESULTS: A total of 3316 individuals with IBD received at 
      least 1 COVID-19 vaccine. Injection site tenderness (68%) and fatigue (46% dose 
      1, 68% dose 2) were the most commonly reported localized and systemic AEs after 
      vaccination. Severe localized and systemic vaccine-related AEs were rare. The 
      mRNA-1273 vaccine was associated with significantly greater severe AEs at dose 2 
      (localized 4% vs 2%, systemic 15% vs 10%; P < .001 for both). Prior COVID-19 
      infection, female sex, and vaccine type were associated with severe systemic 
      reactions to dose 1, while age <50 years, female sex, vaccine type, and antitumor 
      necrosis factor and vedolizumab use were associated with severe systemic 
      reactions to dose 2. Overall rates (2%) of IBD flare were low following 
      vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide reassurance that the severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine is safe and well tolerated among 
      individuals with IBD, which may help to combat vaccine hesitancy and increase 
      vaccine confidence.

TI  - Length of hospital stay and risk of intensive care admission and in-hospital 
      death among COVID-19 patients in Norway: a register-based cohort study comparing 
      patients fully vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine to unvaccinated patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We estimated the length of stay (LoS) in hospital and the intensive 
      care unit (ICU) and risk of admission to ICU and in-hospital death among COVID-19 
      patients ≥18 years in Norway who had been fully vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine 
      (at least two doses or one dose and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection), compared to 
      unvaccinated patients. METHODS: Using national registry data, we analyzed 
      SARS-CoV-2-positive patients hospitalized in Norway between 1 February and 30 
      November 2021, with COVID-19 as the main cause of hospitalization. We ran Cox 
      proportional hazards models adjusting for vaccination status, age, sex, county of 
      residence, regional health authority, date of admission, country of birth, virus 
      variant, and underlying risk factors. RESULTS: We included 716 fully vaccinated 
      patients (crude overall median LoS: 5.2 days; admitted to ICU: 103 (14%); 
      in-hospital death: 86 (13%)) and 2487 unvaccinated patients (crude overall median 
      LoS: 5.0 days; admitted to ICU: 480 (19%); in-hospital death: 102 (4%)). In 
      adjusted models, fully vaccinated patients had a shorter overall LoS in hospital 
      (adjusted log hazard ratios (aHR) for discharge: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.24-2.08), 
      shorter LoS without ICU (aHR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.07-1.52), and lower risk of ICU 
      admission (aHR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.37-0.69) compared to unvaccinated patients. We 
      observed no difference in the LoS in ICU or in risk of in-hospital death between 
      fully vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. DISCUSSION: Fully vaccinated patients 
      hospitalized with COVID-19 in Norway have a shorter LoS and lower risk of ICU 
      admission than unvaccinated patients. These findings can support patient 
      management and ongoing capacity planning in hospitals.

TI  - Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes among 
      individuals with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases tested between March 1 and 
      Nov 22, 2021, in Ontario, Canada: a population-based analysis.
PG  - e430-e440
LID - 10.1016/S2665-9913(22)00096-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We estimated COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 
      infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes among individuals with immune-mediated 
      inflammatory diseases in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: In this population-based 
      analysis, we used a test-negative design across four immune-mediated inflammatory 
      disease population-based cohorts, comprising individuals with rheumatoid 
      arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease. We 
      identified all SARS-CoV-2 tests done in these populations between March 1 and Nov 
      22, 2021 (a period in which there was rapid uptake of vaccines, and the alpha 
      [B.1.1.7] and delta [B.1.617.2] SARS-CoV-2 variants were predominantly 
      circulating in Canada) and separately assessed outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      and severe COVID-19 outcomes (hospitalisation due to COVID-19 and death due to 
      COVID-19) for each disease group. We used multivariable logistic regression to 
      estimate the effectiveness of one, two, and three doses of mRNA-based COVID-19 
      vaccine (BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech], or mRNA-1273 [Moderna]) among individuals at 
      the time of SARS-CoV-2 testing. FINDINGS: Between March 1 and Nov 22, 2021, we 
      identified 2127 (5·9%) test-positive cases among 36 145 individuals (26 476 
      [73·2%] were female and 9669 [26·8%] were male) with rheumatoid arthritis tested, 
      476 (6·1%) test-positive cases among 7863 individuals (4130 [52·5%] were female 
      and 3733 [47·5%] were male) with ankylosing spondylitis tested, 3089 (6·5%) 
      test-positive cases among 47 199 individuals (26 062 [55·2%] were female and 
      21 137 [44·8%] were male) with psoriasis tested, and 1702 (5·4%) test-positive 
      cases among 31 311 individuals (17 716 [56·6%] were female and 13 595 [43·4%] 
      were male) with inflammatory bowel disease tested. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness 
      of two doses against infection was 83% (95% CI 80-86) in those with rheumatoid 
      arthritis, 89% (83-93) among those with ankylosing spondylitis, 84% (81-86) among 
      those with psoriasis, and 79% (74-82) among those with inflammatory bowel 
      disease. After two vaccine doses, effectiveness against infection generally 
      peaked 31-60 days after vaccination and waned gradually with each additional 
      month. Vaccine effectiveness against severe outcomes after two doses was 92% (95% 
      CI 88-95) in those with rheumatoid arthritis, 97% (83-99) among those with 
      ankylosing spondylitis, 92% (86-95) among those with psoriasis, and 94% (88-97) 
      among those with inflammatory bowel disease. Vaccine effectiveness after a third 
      dose against infection was similar to or higher than after the second dose 
      (ranging from 76% [47-89] to 96% [72-99]), although due to a paucity of events, 
      estimates could not be calculated for some subgroups for severe outcomes. 
      INTERPRETATION: Two vaccine doses were found to be highly effective against both 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes in patients with rheumatoid 
      arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease 
      during the study period. Research is needed to determine the durability of 
      effectiveness of three doses over time, particularly against emerging variants.

TI  - Association between influenza vaccination and hospitalisation or all-cause 
      mortality in people with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study.

LID - e000857
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent evidence suggests that influenza vaccination may offer 
      protection against COVID-19 severity. Our aim was to quantify the association 
      between influenza vaccination status and risk of hospitalisation or all-cause 
      mortality in people diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective cohort 
      study using routinely collected health records from patients registered to a 
      General Practitioner (GP) practice in South West England within the Electronic 
      Care and Health Information Analytics database. The cohort included 6921 people 
      with COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic (1 January-31 July 2020). 
      Data on influenza vaccination, hospitalisation and all-cause mortality were 
      ascertained through linked clinical and demographic records. We applied 
      propensity score methods (stabilised inverse probability of treatment weight) to 
      quantify the association between influenza vaccination status and COVID-19 
      outcomes (hospitalisation or all-cause mortality). RESULTS: 2613 (38%) 
      participants received an influenza vaccination between 1 January 2019 and 
      COVID-19 diagnosis. Receipt of influenza vaccination was associated with a 
      significantly lower odds of hospitalisation or all-cause mortality (adjusted OR: 
      0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.97, p=0.02), and 24% reduced odds of all-cause mortality 
      (adjusted OR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.90). DISCUSSION: Influenza vaccination was 
      associated with a 15%-24% lower odds of severe COVID-19 outcomes. The current UK 
      influenza vaccination programme needs urgent expansion as an integral component 
      of the ongoing response plans to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: COVID-19 vaccines are effective, but inequities in vaccine 
      administration and waning immunity may limit vaccine effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: 
      To report statewide trends in vaccine administration and vaccine effectiveness in 
      Minnesota. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used COVID-19 
      vaccine data from the Minnesota Immunization Information Connection from October 
      25, 2020, through October 30, 2021 that were linked with electronic health record 
      (EHR) data from health systems collaborating as part of the Minnesota EHR 
      Consortium (MNEHRC). Participants included individuals who were seen at a 
      participating health system in Minnesota. EXPOSURES: Individuals were considered 
      fully vaccinated in the second week after receipt of a second dose of a BNT162b2 
      or mRNA-1273 vaccine or a single dose of an Ad26.COV.2.S vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES 
      AND MEASURES: A completed vaccination series and vaccine breakthrough, defined as 
      either a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test or a hospital 
      admission the same week or within the 3 weeks following a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR 
      test. A test-negative design and incident rate ratio were used to evaluate 
      COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness separately for the BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and 
      Ad26.COV.2.S vaccines. Rurality and social vulnerability index were assessed at 
      the area level. RESULTS: This study included 4 431 190 unique individuals at 
      participating health systems, and 3 013 704 (68%) of the individuals were fully 
      vaccinated. Vaccination rates were lowest among Minnesotans who identified as 
      Hispanic (116 422 of 217 019 [54%]), multiracial (30 066 of 57 412 [52%]), 
      American Indian or Alaska Native (22 190 of 41 437 [54%]), and Black or African 
      American (158 860 of 326 595 [49%]) compared with Minnesotans who identified as 
      Asian or Pacific Islander (159 999 of 210 994 [76%]) or White (2 402 928 of 
      3 391 747 [71%]). Among individuals aged 19 to 64 years, vaccination rates were 
      lower in rural areas (196 479 of 308 047 [64%]) compared with urban areas 
      (151 541 of 1 951 265 [77%]) and areas with high social vulnerability (544 433 of 
      774 952 [70%]) compared with areas with low social vulnerability (571 613 of 
      724 369 [79%]). In the 9 weeks ending October 30, 2021, vaccine effectiveness as 
      assessed by a test-negative design was 33% (95% CI, 30%-37%) for Ad26.COV.2.S; 
      53% (95% CI, 52%-54%) for BNT162b2; and 66% (95% CI, 65%-67%) for mRNA-1273. For 
      SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalizations, vaccine effectiveness in the 9 weeks ending 
      October 30, 2021, was 78% (95% CI, 75%-81%) for Ad26.COV.2.S; 81% (95% CI, 
      79%-82%) for BNT162b2; and 81% (95% CI, 79%-82%) for mRNA-1273. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: This cohort study of data from a Minnesota statewide consortium 
      suggests disparities in vaccine administration and effectiveness. Vaccine 
      effectiveness against infection was lower for Ad26.COV.2.S and BNT162b2 but was 
      associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalizations despite 
      the increased prevalence of the Delta variant in Minnesota.

TI  - Healthcare workers' views on mandatory SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the UK: A 
      cross-sectional, mixed-methods analysis from the UK-REACH study.
PG  - 101346
LID - 10.1016/j.eclinm.2022.101346 [doi]
LID - 101346
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several countries now have mandatory SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for 
      healthcare workers (HCWs) or the general population. HCWs' views on this are 
      largely unknown. Using data from the nationwide UK-REACH study we aimed to 
      understand UK HCW's views on improving SARS-CoV-2 vaccination coverage, including 
      mandatory vaccination. METHODS: Between 21st April and 26th June 2021, we 
      administered an online questionnaire via email to 17 891 UK HCWs recruited as 
      part of a longitudinal cohort from across the UK who had previously responded to 
      a baseline questionnaire (primarily recruited through email) as part of the 
      United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes in Healthcare 
      workers (UK-REACH) nationwide prospective cohort study. We categorised responses 
      to a free-text question "What should society do if people do not get vaccinated 
      against COVID-19?" using qualitative content analysis. We collapsed categories 
      into a binary variable: favours mandatory vaccination or not, using logistic 
      regression to calculate its demographic predictors, and its occupational, health, 
      and attitudinal predictors adjusted for demographics. FINDINGS: Of 5633 
      questionnaire respondents, 3235 answered the free text question. Median age of 
      free text responders was 47 years (IQR 36-56) and 2705 (74.3%) were female. 18% 
      (n = 578) favoured mandatory vaccination (201 [6%] participants for HCWs and 
      others working with vulnerable populations; 377 [12%] for the general 
      population), but the most frequent suggestion was education (32%, n = 1047). 
      Older HCWs (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.44-2.34 [≥55 years vs 16 years to <40 years]), HCWs 
      vaccinated against influenza (OR 1.49; 95% CI 1.11-2.01 [2 vaccines vs none]), 
      and with more positive vaccination attitudes generally (OR 1.10; 95% CI 
      1.06-1.15) were more likely to favour mandatory vaccination, whereas female HCWs 
      (OR= 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.96, vs male HCWs) and Black HCWs (OR=0.46, 95% CI 
      0.25-0.85, vs white HCWs) were less likely to. INTERPRETATION: Only one in six of 
      the HCWs in this large, diverse, UK-wide sample favoured mandatory vaccination. 
      Building trust, educating, and supporting HCWs who are hesitant about vaccination 
      may be more acceptable, effective, and equitable. FUNDING: MRC-UK Research and 
      Innovation grant (MR/V027549/1) and the Department of Health and Social Care 
      (DHSC) via the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). Core funding was 
      also provided by NIHR Biomedical Research Centres.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research suggests the protection offered by COVID-19 vaccines might 
      wane over time, prompting consideration of booster vaccinations. Data on which 
      vaccines offer the most robust protection over time, and which patients are most 
      vulnerable to attenuating protection, could help inform potential booster 
      programmes. In this study, we used comprehensive hospitalisation data to estimate 
      vaccine effectiveness over time. METHODS: In this case-control study, we used 
      data from a large US health-care system to estimate vaccine effectiveness against 
      severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and examined variation based on time since 
      vaccination, vaccine type, and patients' demographic and clinical 
      characteristics. We compared trends in attenuation of protection across vaccines 
      and used a multivariable model to identify key factors associated with risk for 
      severe breakthrough infection. Patients were considered to have severe COVID-19 
      if they were admitted to the hospital, had a final coded diagnosis of COVID-19 
      (according to International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision code U07.1) 
      or a positive nucleic acid amplification test for symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 during 
      their hospitalisation, and were treated with remdesivir or dexamethasone during 
      hospitalisation. FINDINGS: Between April 1, 2021, and Oct 26, 2021, we observed 
      9667 admissions for severe COVID-19 (ie, cases). Overall, 1293 (13·4%) of 9667 
      cases were fully vaccinated at the time of admission, compared with 22 308 
      (57·7%) of 38 668 controls, who were admitted to hospital for other reasons. The 
      median time between vaccination and hospital admission among cases was 162 days 
      (IQR 118-198). Overall vaccine effectiveness declined mostly over the course of 
      the summer, from 94·5% (95% CI 91·4-96·5) in April, 2021 (pre-delta), to 84·0% 
      (81·6-86·1) by October, 2021. Notably, vaccine effectiveness declined over time, 
      from 94·0% (95% CI 92·8-95·0) at days 50-100 after vaccination to 80·4% 
      (77·8-82·7) by days 200-250 after vaccination. After 250 days, vaccine 
      effectiveness declines were even more notable. Among those who received the 
      BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine, vaccine effectiveness fell from an initial 
      peak of 94·9% (93·2-96·2) to 74·1% (69·6-77·9) by days 200-250 after vaccination. 
      Protection from the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and Ad26.COV2 (Janssen) vaccines declined 
      less over time, although the latter offered lower overall protection. Holding 
      other factors constant, the risk of severe breakthrough infection was most 
      strongly associated with age older than 80 years (adjusted odds ratio 1·76, 95% 
      CI 1·43-2·15), vaccine type (Pfizer 1·39, 0·98-1·97; Janssen 14·53, 8·43-25·03; 
      both relative to Moderna), time since vaccination (1·05, 1·03-1·07; per week 
      after week 8 when protection peaks, technically), and comorbidities including 
      organ transplantation (3·44, 95% CI 2·12-5·57), cancer (1·93, 1·60-2·33), and 
      immunodeficiency (1·49, 1·13-1·96). INTERPRETATION: Vaccination remains highly 
      effective against hospitalisation, but vaccine effectiveness declined after 200 
      days, particularly for older patients or those with specific comorbidities. 
      Additional protection (eg, a booster vaccination) might be warranted for 
      everyone, but especially for these populations. In addition to promoting general 
      vaccine uptake, clinicians and policy makers should consider prioritising booster 
      vaccinations in those most at risk of severe COVID-19. FUNDING: None.

      Cancer: A US Nationwide Veterans Affairs Study.
PG  - 281-286
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2021.5771 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Patients with cancer are at increased risk for severe COVID-19, but 
      it is unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is effective for them. OBJECTIVE: To 
      determine the association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 
      infections among a population of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with cancer. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective, multicenter, nationwide cohort 
      study of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and infection among patients in the VA health 
      care system from December 15, 2020, to May 4, 2021. All adults with solid tumors 
      or hematologic cancer who received systemic cancer-directed therapy from August 
      15, 2010, to May 4, 2021, and were alive and without a documented SARS-CoV-2 
      positive result as of December 15, 2020, were eligible for inclusion. Each day 
      between December 15, 2020, and May 4, 2021, newly vaccinated patients were 
      matched 1:1 with unvaccinated or not yet vaccinated controls based on age, race 
      and ethnicity, VA facility, rurality of home address, cancer type, and treatment 
      type/timing. EXPOSURES: Receipt of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: The primary outcome was documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. A proxy for 
      vaccine effectiveness was defined as 1 minus the risk ratio of SARS-CoV-2 
      infection for vaccinated individuals compared with unvaccinated controls. 
      RESULTS: A total of 184 485 patients met eligibility criteria, and 113 796 were 
      vaccinated. Of these, 29 152 vaccinated patients (median [IQR] age, 74.1 
      [70.2-79.3] years; 95% were men; 71% were non-Hispanic White individuals) were 
      matched 1:1 to unvaccinated or not yet vaccinated controls. As of a median 47 
      days of follow-up, 436 SARS-CoV-2 infections were detected in the matched cohort 
      (161 infections in vaccinated patients vs 275 in unvaccinated patients). There 
      were 17 COVID-19-related deaths in the vaccinated group vs 27 COVID-19-related 
      deaths in the unvaccinated group. Overall vaccine effectiveness in the matched 
      cohort was 58% (95% CI, 39% to 72%) starting 14 days after the second dose. 
      Patients who received chemotherapy within 3 months prior to the first vaccination 
      dose were estimated to have a vaccine effectiveness of 57% (95% CI, -23% to 90%) 
      starting 14 days after the second dose vs 76% (95% CI, 50% to 91%) for those 
      receiving endocrine therapy and 85% (95% CI, 29% to 100%) for those who had not 
      received systemic therapy for at least 6 months prior. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      In this cohort study, COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower SARS-CoV-2 
      infection rates in patients with cancer. Some immunosuppressed subgroups may 
      remain at early risk for COVID-19 despite vaccination, and consideration should 
      be given to additional risk reduction strategies, such as serologic testing for 
      vaccine response and a third vaccine dose to optimize outcomes.

      immunity: a population-based cohort study in Canada.
PG  - 69-76

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We examined the incremental protection and durability of 
      infection-acquired immunity against Omicron infection in individuals with hybrid 
      immunity in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We followed up 6 million individuals with 
      at least one multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test 
      before November 21, 2021, until an Omicron infection. Protection via 
      infection-acquired immunity was assessed by comparing Omicron infection risk 
      between previously infected individuals and those without documented infection 
      under different vaccination scenarios and stratified by time since the last 
      infection or vaccination. RESULTS: A previous infection was associated with 68% 
      (95% CI 61-73) and 43% (95% CI 27-56) increased protection against Omicron 
      infection in individuals with two and three doses, respectively. Among 
      individuals with two-dose vaccination, the incremental protection of 
      infection-induced immunity decreased from 79% (95% CI 75-81) within 3 months 
      after vaccination or infection to 27% (95% CI 14-37) at 9-11 months. In 
      individuals with three-dose vaccination, it decreased from 57% (95% CI 50-63) 
      within 3 months to 37% (95% CI 19-51) at 3-5 months after vaccination or 
      infection. CONCLUSION: Previous SARS-CovV-2 infections provide added 
      cross-variant immunity to vaccination. Given the limited durability of 
      infection-acquired protection in individuals with hybrid immunity, its influence 
      on shield-effects at the population level and reinfection risks at the individual 
      level may be limited.

TI  - COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness among people living with and without HIV in South 
      Carolina, USA: protocol of a population-based cohort study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing severe 
      COVID-19 outcomes, a small percentage of fully vaccinated persons will develop 
      symptomatic or asymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV-2, which is referred to as 
      'breakthrough COVID-19'. People living with HIV (PLWH) appear to have an elevated 
      risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, yet the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine 
      in this population remains unclear due to the limited research efforts in this 
      population in the real world. This study aims to characterise and compare the 
      breakthrough COVID-19 (eg, prevalence and disease severity) between PLWH and 
      non-PLWH and then examine whether HIV markers play a role in COVID-19 vaccine 
      effectiveness within the PLWH population. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This cohort study 
      will merge electronic health records data from multiple data sources in South 
      Carolina (SC), including the 'HIV Cohort' (n=12 203) identified from the 
      statewide Enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System, 'Vaccine Cohort' from the Statewide 
      Immunisation Online Network which provides patient-level immunisation records 
      (n=~1.71 million), and 'COVID-19 Cohort' which includes healthcare encounters and 
      COVID-19 diagnosis information for all individuals who were tested for COVID-19 
      (n=~3.41 million). The PLWH will be matched with a comparison group of non-PLWH 
      by the propensity score matching method. To distinguish the role of immunity 
      level in affecting the vaccine effectiveness, we will conduct subgroup analyses 
      to compare the outcome of virally controlled and immunosuppressed PLWH with 
      non-PLWH. Conditional logistic regression and generalised linear models will be 
      employed to analyse the relationship between HIV status and protection durability 
      by adjusting for potential confounders. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was 
      approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of South Carolina 
      (Pro00117583) as a Non-Human Subject study. The study's findings will be 
      published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated at national and 
      international conferences and through social media.

AB  - By September 21, 2021, an estimated 182 million persons in the United States were 
      fully vaccinated against COVID-19.* Clinical trials indicate that Pfizer-BioNTech 
      (BNT162b2), Moderna (mRNA-1273), and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson; Ad.26.COV2.S) 
      vaccines are effective and generally well tolerated (1-3). However, daily 
      vaccination rates have declined approximately 78% since April 13, 2021(†); 
      vaccine safety concerns have contributed to vaccine hesitancy (4). A cohort study 
      of 19,625 nursing home residents found that those who received an mRNA vaccine 
      (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) had lower all-cause mortality than did unvaccinated 
      residents (5), but no studies comparing mortality rates within the general 
      population of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons have been conducted. To assess 
      mortality not associated with COVID-19 (non-COVID-19 mortality) after COVID-19 
      vaccination in a general population setting, a cohort study was conducted during 
      December 2020-July 2021 among approximately 11 million persons enrolled in seven 
      Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) sites.(§) After standardizing mortality rates by 
      age and sex, this study found that COVID-19 vaccine recipients had lower 
      non-COVID-19 mortality than did unvaccinated persons. After adjusting for 
      demographic characteristics and VSD site, this study found that adjusted relative 
      risk (aRR) of non-COVID-19 mortality for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 0.41 
      (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38-0.44) after dose 1 and 0.34 (95% 
      CI = 0.33-0.36) after dose 2. The aRRs of non-COVID-19 mortality for the Moderna 
      vaccine were 0.34 (95% CI = 0.32-0.37) after dose 1 and 0.31 (95% CI = 0.30-0.33) 
      after dose 2. The aRR after receipt of the Janssen vaccine was 0.54 (95% 
      CI = 0.49-0.59). There is no increased risk for mortality among COVID-19 vaccine 
      recipients. This finding reinforces the safety profile of currently approved 
      COVID-19 vaccines in the United States.

PG  - S179-S182

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To date, there are no effective treatments for decreasing 
      hospitalizations in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections. It has been 
      suggested that the influenza vaccine might attenuate the severity of COVID-19. 
      METHODS: This is a retrospective single-centered cohort review of a de-identified 
      database of 2005 patients over the age of 18 within the University of Florida 
      health care system who tested positive for COVID-19. Comorbidities and influenza 
      vaccination status were examined. The primary outcome was severity of disease as 
      reflected by hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Logistic 
      regression was performed to examine the relationship between influenza status and 
      hospitalization. RESULTS: COVID-19-positive patients who had not received the 
      influenza vaccination within the last year had a 2.44 (95% CI, 1.68, 3.61) 
      greater odds of hospitalization and a 3.29 (95% CI, 1.18, 13.77) greater odds of 
      ICU admission when compared with those who were vaccinated. These results were 
      controlled to account for age, race, gender, hypertension, diabetes, chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, coronary artery disease, and congestive 
      heart failure. DISCUSSION: Our analysis suggests that the influenza vaccination 
      is potentially protective of moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 infection. 
      This protective effect holds regardless of comorbidity. The literature points to 
      a potential mechanism via natural killer cell activation. Though our data 
      potentially is limited by its generalizability and our vaccination rate is low, 
      it holds significant relevance given the upcoming influenza season. Not only 
      could simply encouraging influenza vaccination decrease morbidity and mortality 
      from the flu, but it might help flatten the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic as 
      well. We encourage further studies into this finding.

TI  - COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in India, the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, and 
      implications for vaccination.
LID - 2021.06.21.21259268 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2021.06.21.21259268 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 Delta pandemic wave in India surged and declined within 
      3 months; cases then remained low despite the continued spread of Delta 
      elsewhere. Here we aim to estimate key epidemiological characteristics of the 
      Delta variant based on data from India and examine the underpinnings of its 
      dynamics. METHODS: We utilize multiple datasets and model-inference methods to 
      reconstruct COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in India during March 2020 - June 2021. We 
      further use model estimates to retrospectively predict cases and deaths during 
      July - mid-Oct 2021, under various vaccination and vaccine effectiveness (VE) 
      settings to estimate the impact of vaccination and VE for non-Delta-infection 
      recoverees. FINDINGS: We estimate that Delta escaped immunity in 34.6% (95% CI: 0 
      - 64.2%) of individuals with prior wildtype infection and was 57.0% (95% CI: 37.9 
      - 75.6%) more infectious than wildtype SARS-CoV-2. Models assuming higher VE 
      among those with prior non-Delta infection, particularly after the 1 (st) dose, 
      generated more accurate predictions than those assuming no such increases 
      (best-performing VE setting: 90/95% vs. 30/67% baseline for the 1 (st) /2 (nd) 
      dose). Counterfactual modeling indicates that high vaccination coverage for 1 
      (st) vaccine-dose in India (∼50% by mid-Oct 2021) combined with the boosting of 
      VE among recoverees averted around 60% of infections during July - mid-Oct 2021. 
      INTERPRETATION: Non-pharmaceutical interventions, infection seasonality, and high 
      coverage of 1-dose vaccination likely all contributed to pandemic dynamics in 
      India during 2021. Given the shortage of COVID-19 vaccines globally and boosting 
      of VE, for populations with high prior infection rates, prioritizing the first 
      vaccine-dose may protect more people. RESEARCH IN CONTEXT: Evidence before this 
      study: We searched PubMed for studies published through Nov 3, 2021 on the Delta 
      (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 variant that focused on three areas: 1) transmissibility 
      [search terms: ("Delta variant" OR "B.1.617") AND ("transmission rate" OR "growth 
      rate" OR "secondary attack rate" OR "transmissibility")]; 2) immune response 
      ([search terms: ("Delta variant" OR "B.1.617") AND ("immune evas" OR "immune 
      escape")]; and 3) vaccine effectiveness ([search terms: ("Delta variant" OR 
      "B.1.617") AND ("vaccine effectiveness" OR "vaccine efficacy" OR "vaccination")]. 
      Our search returned 256 papers, from which we read the abstracts and identified 
      54 relevant studies.Forty-two studies addressed immune evasion and/or vaccine 
      effectiveness. Around half (n=19) of these studies measured the neutralizing 
      ability of convalescent sera and/or vaccine sera against Delta and most reported 
      some reduction (around 2-to 8-fold) compared to ancestral variants. The remainder 
      (n=23) used field observations (often with a test-negative or cohort-design) and 
      reported lower VE against infection but similar VE against hospitalization or 
      death. Together, these laboratory and field observations consistently indicate 
      that Delta can evade preexisting immunity. In addition, five studies reported 
      higher B-cell and/or T-cell vaccine-induced immune response among recovered 
      vaccinees than naïve vaccinees, suggesting potential boosting of pre-existing 
      immunity; however, all studies were based on small samples (n = 10 to 198 
      individuals).Sixteen studies examined transmissibility, including 1) laboratory 
      experiments (n=6) showing that Delta has higher affinity to the cell receptor, 
      fuses membranes more efficiently, and/or replicates faster than other SARS-CoV-2 
      variants, providing biological mechanisms for its higher transmissibility; 2) 
      field studies (n=5) showing higher rates of breakthrough infections by Delta 
      and/or higher viral load among Delta infections than other variants; and 3) 
      modeling/mixed studies (n=5) using genomic or case data to estimate the growth 
      rate or reproduction number, reporting a 60-120% increase. Only one study jointly 
      estimated the increase in transmissibility (1.3-1.7-fold, 50% CI) and immune 
      evasion (10-50%, 50% CI); this study also reported a 27.5% (25/91) reinfection 
      rate by Delta.Added value of this study: We utilize observed pandemic dynamics 
      and the differential vaccination coverage for two vaccine doses in India, where 
      the Delta variant was first identified, to estimate the epidemiological 
      properties of Delta and examine the impact of prior non-Delta infection on immune 
      boosting at the population level. We estimate that Delta variant can escape 
      immunity from prior wildtype infection roughly one-third of the time and is 
      around 60% more infectious than wildtype SARS-CoV-2. In addition, our analysis 
      suggests the large increase in population receiving their first vaccine dose 
      (∼50% by end of Oct 2021) combined with the boosting effect of vaccination for 
      non-Delta infection recoverees likely mitigated epidemic intensity in India 
      during July - Oct 2021.Implications of all the available evidence: Our analysis 
      reconstructs the interplay and effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions, 
      infection seasonality, Delta variant emergence, and vaccination on COVID-19 
      pandemic dynamics in India. Modeling findings support prioritizing the first 
      vaccine dose in populations with high prior infection rates, given vaccine 
      shortages.

AB  - Aim: To compare the seropositivity rate of cancer patients with noncancer 
      controls after inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and evaluate the factors affecting 
      seropositivity. Method: Spike IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were measured in 
      blood samples of 776 cancer patients and 715 noncancer volunteers. An IgG level 
      ≥50 AU/ml is accepted as seropositive. Results: The seropositivity rate was 85.2% 
      in the patient group and 97.5% in the control group. The seropositivity rate and 
      antibody levels were significantly lower in the patient group (p < 0.001). Age 
      and chemotherapy were associated with lower seropositivity in cancer patients 
      (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This study highlighted the efficacy and safety of the 
      inactivated vaccine in cancer patients. Clinical Trials Registration:

OAB - Cancer patients are at high risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2 and of developing 
      the associated disease, COVID-19, which therefore puts them in the priority group 
      for vaccination. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of inactive 
      SARSCoV-2 vaccination, an inactivated virus vaccine, in cancer patients. The 
      immune response rate, defined as seropositivity, was 85.2% in the cancer patient 
      group and 97.5% in the control group. The levels of antibodies, which are blood 
      markers of immune response to the vaccine, were also significantly lower in the 
      patient group, especially in those older than 60 years and receiving 
      chemotherapy. These results highlight the importance of determining the effective 
      vaccine type and dose in cancer patients to protect them from COVID-19 without 
      disrupting their cancer treatment.

LID - 10.2147/IJGM.S309022 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of booster 
      vaccination of adults with measles-mumps-rubella in the COVID-19 infection rates. 
      METHODS: In order to investigate this hypothesis, we tested COVID-19 positivity 
      rate through PCR assay on the participants (n=245; male), who had to share the 
      same student accommodation together with the same dining hall to provide 
      governmental service. Participants were divided into two groups based on their 
      booster vaccination status with measles-mumps-rubella: the non-vaccinated group 
      (n=207) and the vaccinated group (n=38). The rate of COVID-19 seropositivity, 
      age, body mass index (BMI), active smoking and presence of comorbidity were also 
      measured and recorded. RESULTS: All of the participants were healthy, and age 
      distribution, comorbidity rates, active smoking status and BMI did not vary 
      significantly among the two groups (p=0.305, p=0.594, p=0.280, and p=0.922, 
      respectively). About 36.7% (n=90) of the participants were found to be COVID-19 
      positive by PCR among which the non-vaccinated cases had higher rates of COVID-19 
      seropositivity than the vaccinated cases (40.6% vs 15.8%) (OR=3.6, 95%CI: 
      1.5-9.0, p=0.004). CONCLUSION: Based on these results, we cautiously predict that 
      immunity produced by MMR vaccination boosters may provide some degree of 
      protection against COVID-19 in the adult population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The global health has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic 
      persistently, of which Omicron is currently the predominant variant. However, the 
      impact of vaccination on Omicron remained uncertain. OBJECTIVE: This study sought 
      to explore the effect of vaccination on patients infected with Omicron. METHODS: 
      A retrospective observational cohort was conducted in the largest Fangcang 
      shelter hospital in Shanghai from April 1 to May 30, 2022. The demographics, 
      length of hospital stay, clinical symptoms, the comorbidities and vaccination 
      status were recorded. Clinical outcomes of the vaccinated and non-vaccinated 
      groups were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 3,119 patients who fulfilled 
      the eligibility criteria and were enrolled in the study, 2,226 (71.4%) patients 
      had received nCoV-19 vaccine while 893 (28.6%) patients had not received it 
      before admission. Patients in the vaccinated group had significantly shorter 
      length of hospital stay than those in the unvaccinated group (15.48 ± 2.708 vs. 
      15.85 ± 3.102, p < 0.001). More asymptomatic patients were observed in the 
      vaccinated group than the non-vaccinated (70.4 vs. 64.5%, p < 0.001). Further 
      subgroup analysis demonstrated that the older the age, the more significant the 
      difference was (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination was associated with a 
      significant reduction in the severity of Omicron infection compared with no 
      vaccination. Vaccination appears to make Omicron-infected people with milder 
      symptoms than unvaccinated people. This suggests the potential effectiveness of 
      current vaccines against Omicron.

      SARS-CoV-2 Virus: A Nationwide Historical Cohort Study.
PG  - ofab262
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofab262 [doi]
LID - ofab262
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is strong evidence regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of 
      the BNT162b2 vaccine in preventing symptomatic infection with severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is a relative paucity of 
      data regarding its effectiveness in the prevention of asymptomatic infection. 
      METHODS: In this real-world observational study, we identified a subpopulation of 
      individuals in a large health maintenance organization who were repeatedly tested 
      for SARS-CoV-2 infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We included these 
      individuals in the study cohort and compared those who were vaccinated with 
      BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to unvaccinated individuals. A positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test 
      result was used as the outcome. The follow-up period was from January 1, 2021, 
      until February 11, 2021. RESULTS: A total of 6286 individuals were included in 
      the cohort. Seven days after the second vaccine dose, a rate of 6 positive PCR 
      tests per 10 000 person-days was recorded, compared with a rate of 53 positive 
      tests per 10 000 person-days for the unvaccinated group. The estimated vaccine 
      effectiveness against infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus after 2 vaccine doses was 
      89% (95% CI, 82%-94%). The estimated effectiveness 2 weeks after the first 
      vaccine dose was 61% (95% CI, 49%-71%). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, vaccination 
      with BNT162b2 reduced infection rates among individuals who underwent screening 
      by frequent SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Using a cohort of frequently tested 
      individuals reduced the indication bias for the PCR testing, which enabled 
      estimation of infection rates.

      July-December 2021.
PG  - 52-58
LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm7102e1 [doi]
AB  - Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a severe postinfectious 
      hyperinflammatory condition, which generally occurs 2-6 weeks after a typically 
      mild or asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 
      (1-3). In the United States, the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine is 
      currently authorized for use in children and adolescents aged 5-15 years under an 
      Emergency Use Authorization and is fully licensed by the Food and Drug 
      Administration for persons aged ≥16 years (4). Prelicensure randomized trials in 
      persons aged ≥5 years documented high vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity (5),(§) 
      and real-world studies in persons aged 12-18 years demonstrated high vaccine 
      effectiveness (VE) against severe COVID-19 (6). Recent evidence suggests that 
      COVID-19 vaccination is associated with lower MIS-C incidence among adolescents 
      (7); however, VE of the 2-dose Pfizer-BioNTech regimen against MIS-C has not been 
      evaluated. The effectiveness of 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine received ≥28 
      days before hospital admission in preventing MIS-C was assessed using a 
      test-negative case-control design(¶) among hospitalized patients aged 12-18 years 
      at 24 pediatric hospitals in 20 states** during July 1-December 9, 2021, the 
      period when most MIS-C patients could be temporally linked to SARS-CoV-2 
      B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant predominance. Patients with MIS-C (case-patients) and 
      two groups of hospitalized controls matched to case-patients were evaluated: 
      test-negative controls had at least one COVID-19-like symptom and negative 
      SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or 
      antigen-based assay results, and syndrome-negative controls were hospitalized 
      patients without COVID-19-like illness. Among 102 MIS-C case-patients and 181 
      hospitalized controls, estimated effectiveness of 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech 
      vaccine against MIS-C was 91% (95% CI = 78%-97%). All 38 MIS-C patients requiring 
      life support were unvaccinated. Receipt of 2 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine 
      is associated with a high level of protection against MIS-C in persons aged 12-18 
      years, highlighting the importance of vaccination among all eligible children.

TI  - Ongoing Mycophenolate Treatment Impairs Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination Response in 
      Patients Affected by Chronic Inflammatory Autoimmune Diseases or Liver 
      Transplantation Recipients: Results of the RIVALSA Prospective Cohort.
LID - 10.3390/v14081766 [doi]
LID - 1766
AB  - Vaccines are the most effective means to prevent the potentially deadly effects 
      of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but not all vaccinated individuals gain the same degree 
      of protection. Patients undergoing chronic immunosuppressive therapy due to 
      autoimmune diseases or liver transplants, for example, may show impaired 
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response after vaccination. We performed a prospective 
      observational study with parallel arms, aiming to (a) evaluate seroconversion 
      after anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine administration in different subgroups of 
      patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment for rheumatological or autoimmune 
      diseases or to prevent organ rejection after liver transplantation and (b) 
      identify negative predictors of IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 development. Out of 437 
      eligible patients, 183 individuals were enrolled at the Rheumatology and 
      Hepatology Tertiary Units of "Maggiore della Carità" University Hospital in 
      Novara: of those, 52 were healthy subjects, while among the remaining 131 
      patients, 30 had a diagnosis of spondyloarthritis, 25 had autoimmune hepatitis, 
      10 were liver transplantation recipients, 23 suffered from connective tissue 
      diseases (including 10 cases that overlapped with other diseases), 40 were 
      treated for rheumatoid arthritis, and 5 had vasculitis. Moreover, all patients 
      were receiving chronic immunosuppressive therapy. The immunogenicity of mRNA 
      COVID-19 vaccines was evaluated by measuring IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers 
      before vaccination and after 10, 30, and 90 days since the first dose 
      administration. Of the selected cohort of patients, 24.0% did not develop any 
      detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG after a complete mRNA-based two doses primary 
      vaccination cycle. At univariate analysis, independent predictors of an absent 
      antibody response to vaccine were a history of liver transplantation (OR 11.5, 
      95% CI 2.5-53.7, p = 0.0018), the presence of a comorbid active neoplasia (OR 
      26.4, 95% CI 2.8-252.4, p = 0.0045), and an ongoing immunosuppressive treatment 
      with mycophenolate (MMF) (OR 14.0, 95% CI 3.6-54.9, p = 0.0002) or with 
      calcineurin inhibitors (OR 17.5, 95% CI 3.1-99.0, p = 0.0012). At multivariate 
      analysis, only treatment with MMF (OR 24.8, 95% CI 5.9-103.2, p &lt; 0.0001) and 
      active neoplasia (OR 33.2, 95% CI 5.4-204.1, p = 0.0002) were independent 
      predictors of seroconversion failure. These findings suggest that MMF dose 
      reduction or suspension may be required to optimize vaccine response in these 
      patients.

TI  - Association of Zip Code Vaccination Rate With COVID-19 Mortality in Chicago, 
      Illinois.
PG  - e2214753

AB  - IMPORTANCE: There has been large geographic inequity in vaccination coverage 
      across Chicago, Illinois, with higher vaccination rates in zip codes with 
      residents who predominantly have high incomes and are White. OBJECTIVE: To 
      determine the association between inequitable zip code-level vaccination coverage 
      and COVID-19 mortality in Chicago. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 
      retrospective cohort study used Chicago Department of Public Health vaccination 
      and mortality data and Cook County Medical Examiner mortality data from March 1, 
      2020, through November 6, 2021, to assess the association of COVID-19 mortality 
      with zip code-level vaccination rates. Data were analyzed from June 1, 2021, to 
      April 13, 2022. EXPOSURES: Zip code-level first-dose vaccination rates before the 
      Alpha and Delta waves of COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary 
      outcome was deaths from COVID-19 during the Alpha and Delta waves. The 
      association of a marginal increase in zip code-level vaccination rate with weekly 
      mortality rates was estimated with a mixed-effects Poisson regression model, and 
      the total number of preventable deaths in the least vaccinated quartile of zip 
      codes was estimated with a linear difference-in-difference design. RESULTS: The 
      study population was 2 686 355 Chicago residents in 52 zip codes (median [IQR] 
      age 34 [32-38] years; 1 378 658 [51%] women; 773 938 Hispanic residents [29%]; 
      783 916 non-Hispanic Black residents [29%]; 894 555 non-Hispanic White residents 
      [33%]). Among residents in the least vaccinated quartile, 80% were non-Hispanic 
      Black, compared with 8% of residents identifying as non-Hispanic Black in the 
      most vaccinated quartile (P < .001). After controlling for age distribution and 
      recovery from COVID-19, a 10-percentage point increase in zip code-level 
      vaccination 6 weeks before the peak of the Alpha wave was associated with a 39% 
      lower relative risk of death from COVID-19 (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.61 [95% 
      CI, 0.52-0.72]). A 10-percentage point increase in zip code vaccination rate 6 
      weeks before the peak of the Delta wave was associated with a 24% lower relative 
      risk of death (IRR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.66-0.87]). The difference-in-difference 
      estimate was that 119 Alpha wave deaths (72% [95% CI, 63%-81%]) and 108 Delta 
      wave deaths (75% [95% CI, 66%-84%]) might have been prevented in the least 
      vaccinated quartile of zip codes if it had had the vaccination coverage of the 
      most vaccinated quartile. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that 
      low zip code-level vaccination rates in Chicago were associated with more deaths 
      during the Alpha and Delta waves of COVID-19 and that inequitable vaccination 
      coverage exacerbated existing racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 deaths.

TI  - Real-world study of the effectiveness of BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm) COVID-19 vaccine 
      in the Kingdom of Morocco.
PG  - 1584
LID - 10.1186/s12889-022-14016-9 [doi]
LID - 1584
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Kingdom of Morocco approved BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm) COVID-19 
      vaccine for emergency use on 22 January 2021 in a two-dose, three-to-four-week 
      interval schedule. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to determine 
      real-world BBIBP-CorV vaccine effectiveness (VE) against serious or critical 
      hospitalization of individuals RT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the first 
      five months of BBIBP-CorV use in Morocco. METHODS: The study was conducted among 
      adults 18-99 years old who were tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection between 
      1 February and 30 June 2021. RT-PCR results were individually linked with 
      outcomes from the COVID-19 severe or critical hospitalization dataset and with 
      vaccination histories from the national vaccination registration system. 
      Individuals with partial vaccination (< 2 weeks after dose two) or in receipt of 
      any other COVID-19 vaccine were excluded. Unadjusted and adjusted VE estimates 
      against hospitalization for serious or critical illness were made by comparing 
      two-dose vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in logistic regression models, 
      calculated as (1-odds ratio) * 100%. RESULTS: There were 348,190 individuals able 
      to be matched across the three databases. Among these, 140,892 were fully 
      vaccinated, 206,149 were unvaccinated, and 1,149 received homologous BBIBP-CorV 
      booster doses. Unadjusted, full-series, unboosted BBIBP-CorV VE against 
      hospitalization for serious or critical illness was 90.2% (95%CI: 87.8-92.0%). 
      Full-series, unboosted VE, adjusted for age, sex, and calendar day of RT-PCR 
      test, was 88.5% (95%CI: 85.8-90.7%). Calendar day- and sex-adjusted VE was 96.4% 
      (95%CI: 94.6-97.6%) for individuals < 60 years, and was 53.3% (95%CI: 39.6-63.9%) 
      for individuals 60 years and older. There were no serious or critical illnesses 
      among BBIBP-CorV-boosted individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Effectiveness of Sinopharm's 
      BBIBP-CorV was consistent with phase III clinical trial results. Two doses of 
      BBIBP-CorV was highly protective against COVID-19-associated serious or critical 
      hospitalization in working-age adults under real-world conditions and moderately 
      effective in older adults. Booster dose vaccination was associated with complete 
      protection, regardless of age, although only a small proportion of subjects 
      received booster doses.

TI  - Uptake and adverse reactions of COVID-19 vaccination among people living with HIV 
      in China: a case-control study.
PG  - 4964-4970
LID - 10.1080/21645515.2021.1991183 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to ravage 
      the world. People living with HIV (PLHIV) are one of the most vulnerable groups. 
      This study aims to identify the factors associated with the uptake and adverse 
      reactions of COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: We recruited PLHIV in China by 
      convenience sampling between 7 and 23 February 2021. Participants were asked to 
      complete an online questionnaire. Chi-squared test and multivariable logistic 
      regression were used to assess factors associated with vaccine uptake. RESULTS: A 
      total of 527 vaccinated and 1091 unvaccinated PLHIV were recruited. Individuals 
      who had a higher education, engaged in occupations with a higher risk of COVID-19 
      infection, received influenza or pneumonia vaccine in the past 3 years (5.40, 
      3.36-8.77), believed in the effectiveness of vaccines (3.01, 2.20-4.12), and 
      received media information regarding COVID-19 vaccine (2.23, 1.61-3.11), were 
      more likely to be vaccinated. Concerning about adverse reactions (0.31, 
      0.22-0.44), negative impact on the progression of HIV/AIDS (0.36, 0.26-0.50) or 
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) (0.61, 0.44-0.85), disclosure of HIV infection 
      status (0.69, 0.49-0.96), comorbidities (0.33, 0.22-0.47), being unmarried (0.43, 
      0.28-0.66) and older age were negatively associated with vaccination. Of the 527 
      vaccinated PLHIV, 155 (29.4%) PLHIV reported adverse reactions, with pain at the 
      injection site being the most common (18.2%). CONCLUSIONS: PLHIV, who are 
      concerned about adverse reactions, negative impact on ART outcome and disclosure 
      of HIV infection status, were less likely to adopt COVID-19 vaccination. To 
      increase vaccination coverage among PLHIV, health-care professionals should 
      emphasize the benefits and necessity of vaccination and provide consultancy 
      regarding adverse reactions.

AB  - The durability of immune responses after COVID-19 vaccination will drive 
      long-term vaccine effectiveness across settings and may differ by vaccine type. 
      To determine durability of protection of COVID-19 vaccines (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, 
      and Ad26.COV2.S) following primary vaccination in the United States, a matched 
      case-control study was conducted in three cohorts between 1 January and 7 
      September 2021 using de-identified data from a database covering 168 million 
      lives. Odds ratios (ORs) for developing outcomes of interest (breakthrough 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, or intensive care unit admission) were 
      determined for each vaccine (no direct comparisons). In total, 17,017,435 
      individuals were identified. Relative to the baseline, stable protection was 
      observed for Ad26.COV2.S against infections (OR [95% confidence interval (CI)], 
      1.31 [1.18-1.47]) and hospitalizations (OR [95% CI], 1.25 [0.86-1.80]). Relative 
      to the baseline, protection waned over time against infections for BNT162b2 (OR 
      [95% CI], 2.20 [2.01-2.40]) and mRNA-1273 (OR [95% CI], 2.07 [1.87-2.29]) and 
      against hospitalizations for BNT162b2 (OR [95% CI], 2.38 [1.79-3.17]). Baseline 
      protection remained stable for intensive care unit admissions for all three 
      vaccines. Calculated baseline VE was consistent with published literature. This 
      study suggests that the three vaccines in three separate populations may have 
      different durability profiles.

TI  - The Protective Effect of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Vaccination on 
      Postacute Sequelae of COVID-19: A Multicenter Study From a Large National Health 
      Research Network.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have been proven to 
      decrease the severity of acute-phase infection; however, little is known about 
      their effect on postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). METHODS: Patients with 
      confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and minimum age of 18 years with 3-month follow-up 
      postdiagnosis between 21 September 2020 and 14 December 2021 were identified from 
      the TriNetX Research Network platform. The primary outcomes consisted of 
      new-onset or persistent symptoms, new-onset diagnoses, and death and were 
      compared between vaccine and no-vaccine groups. RESULTS: At baseline, 1 578 719 
      patients with confirmed COVID-19 were identified and 1.6% (n = 25 225) completed 
      vaccination. After matching, there were no differences (P > .05) in demographics 
      or preexisting comorbidities. At 28 days following COVID-19 diagnosis, the 
      incidence of hypertension was 13.52 per 1000, diabetes was 5.98 per 1000, thyroid 
      disease was 3.80 per 1000, heart disease was 15.41 per 1000, and mental disorders 
      was 14.77 per 1000 in the vaccine cohort. At 90 days following COVID-19 
      diagnosis, the relative risk of hypertension was 0.33 (95% confidence interval 
      [CI], .26-.42), diabetes was 0.28 (95% CI, .20-.38), heart disease was 0.35 (95% 
      CI, .29-.44), and death was 0.21 (95% CI, .16-.27). Differences in both 28- and 
      90-day risk between the vaccine and no-vaccine cohorts were observed for each 
      outcome, and there was enough evidence (P < .05) to suggest that these 
      differences were attributed to the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that 
      COVID-19 vaccine is protective against PASC symptoms, new onset of health 
      conditions, and mortality.

      U.S. Cohort of Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 Prior to Vaccine Availability.
PG  - 132-141

AB  - PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic posed unprecedented demands on health care. This 
      study aimed to characterize COVID-19 inpatients and examine trends and risk 
      factors associated with hospitalization duration, intensive care unit (ICU) 
      admission, and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed 
      patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized at an integrated health system 
      between February 2, 2020, and December 12, 2020. Patient characteristics and 
      clinical outcomes were obtained from medical records. Backward stepwise logistic 
      regression analyses were used to identify independent risk factors of ICU 
      admission and in-hospital mortality. Cox proportional hazards models were used to 
      evaluate relationships between ICU admission and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: 
      Overall, 9647 patients were analyzed. Mean age was 64.6 ± 18 years. A linear 
      decrease was observed for hospitalization duration (0.13 days/week, R(2)=0.71; 
      P<0.0001), ICU admissions (0.35%/week, R(2)=0.44; P<0.001), and hospital 
      mortality (0.16%/week, R(2)=0.31; P<0.01). Bacterial co-infections, male sex, 
      history of chronic lung and heart disease, diabetes, and Hispanic ethnicity were 
      identified as independent predictors of ICU admission (P<0.001). ICU admission 
      and age of ≥65 years were the strongest independent risk factors associated with 
      in-hospital mortality (P<0.001). The in-hospital mortality rate was 8.3% (27.4% 
      in ICU patients, 2.6% in non-ICU patients; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Results 
      indicate that, over the pandemic's first 10 months, COVID-19 carried a heavy 
      burden of morbidity and mortality in older patients (>65 years), males, 
      Hispanics, and those with bacterial co-infections and chronic comorbidities. 
      Although disease severity has steadily declined following administration of 
      COVID-19 vaccines along with improved understanding of effective COVID-19 
      interventions, these study findings reflect a "natural history" for this novel 
      infectious disease in the U.S. Midwest.
