rayyan-954179483,Association of Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection With Risk of Breakthrough Infection Following mRNA Vaccination in Qatar.,2021,11,16,JAMA,1538-3598 (Electronic),326,19,1930-1939,Abu-Raddad LJ and Chemaitelly H and Ayoub HH and Yassine HM and Benslimane FM and Al Khatib HA and Tang P and Hasan MR and Coyle P and Al Kanaani Z and Al Kuwari E and Jeremijenko A and Kaleeckal AH and Latif AN and Shaik RM and Abdul Rahim HF and Nasrallah GK and Al Kuwari MG and Butt AA and Al Romaihi HE and Al-Thani MH and Al Khal A and Bertollini R,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34724027/,eng,,United States,"IMPORTANCE: The effect of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection on vaccine protection remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To assess protection from SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection after mRNA vaccination among persons with vs without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Matched-cohort studies in Qatar for the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines. A total of 1 531 736 individuals vaccinated with either vaccine between December 21, 2020, and September 19, 2021, were followed up beginning 14 days after receiving the second dose until September 19, 2021. EXPOSURES: Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive nasopharyngeal swab regardless of reason for PCR testing or presence of symptoms. Cumulative incidence was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator method. RESULTS: The BNT162b2-vaccinated cohort comprised 99 226 individuals with and 290 432 matched individuals without prior PCR-confirmed infection (median age, 37 years; 68% male). The mRNA-1273-vaccinated cohort comprised 58 096 individuals with and 169 514 matched individuals without prior PCR-confirmed infection (median age, 36 years; 73% male). Among BNT162b2-vaccinated persons, 159 reinfections occurred in those with and 2509 in those without prior infection 14 days or more after dose 2. Among mRNA-1273-vaccinated persons, 43 reinfections occurred in those with and 368 infections in those without prior infection. Cumulative infection incidence among BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals was an estimated 0.15% (95% CI, 0.12%-0.18%) in those with and 0.83% (95% CI, 0.79%-0.87%) in those without prior infection at 120 days of follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio for breakthrough infection with prior infection, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.15-0.21]; P < .001). Cumulative infection incidence among mRNA-1273-vaccinated individuals was an estimated 0.11% (95% CI, 0.08%-0.15%) in those with and 0.35% (95% CI, 0.32%-0.40%) in those without prior infection at 120 days of follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.25-0.48]; P < .001). Vaccinated individuals with prior infection 6 months or more before dose 1 had statistically significantly lower risk for breakthrough infection than those vaccinated less than 6 months before dose 1 (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.42-0.92]; P = .02 for BNT162b2 and 0.40 [95% CI, 0.18-0.91]; P = .03 for mRNA-1273 vaccination). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a statistically significantly lower risk for breakthrough infection among individuals receiving the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines in Qatar between December 21, 2020, and September 19, 2021. The observational study design precludes direct comparisons of infection risk between the 2 vaccines.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1001/jama.2021.19623,"2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273;Adult;Aged;BNT162 Vaccine;COVID-19/*complications/diagnosis/prevention & control;COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing;*COVID-19 Vaccines;Cohort Studies;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Qatar;RNA, Messenger;Vaccination;Vaccines",34724027,PMC8561432

Protection conferred by booster doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines in Qatar, as compared with protection conferred by the two-dose primary series, is unclear. METHODS: We conducted two matched retrospective cohort studies to assess the effectiveness of booster vaccination, as compared with that of a two-dose primary series alone, against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and Covid-19-related hospitalization and death during a large wave of omicron infections from December 19, 2021, through January 26, 2022. The association of booster status with infection was estimated with the use of Cox proportional-hazards regression models. RESULTS: In a population of 2,239,193 persons who had received at least two doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine, those who had also received a booster were matched with persons who had not received a booster. Among the BNT162b2-vaccinated persons, the cumulative incidence of symptomatic omicron infection was 2.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3 to 2.5) in the booster cohort and 4.5% (95% CI, 4.3 to 4.6) in the nonbooster cohort after 35 days of follow-up. Booster effectiveness against symptomatic omicron infection, as compared with that of the primary series, was 49.4% (95% CI, 47.1 to 51.6). Booster effectiveness against Covid-19-related hospitalization and death due to omicron infection, as compared with the primary series, was 76.5% (95% CI, 55.9 to 87.5). BNT162b2 booster effectiveness against symptomatic infection with the delta (or B.1.617.2) variant, as compared with the primary series, was 86.1% (95% CI, 67.3 to 94.1). Among the mRNA-1273-vaccinated persons, the cumulative incidence of symptomatic omicron infection was 1.0% (95% CI, 0.9 to 1.2) in the booster cohort and 1.9% (95% CI, 1.8 to 2.1) in the nonbooster cohort after 35 days; booster effectiveness against symptomatic omicron infection, as compared with the primary series, was 47.3% (95% CI, 40.7 to 53.3). Few severe Covid-19 cases were noted in the mRNA-1273-vaccinated cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The messenger RNA (mRNA) boosters were highly effective against symptomatic delta infection, but they were less effective against symptomatic omicron infection. However, with both variants, mRNA boosters led to strong protection against Covid-19-related hospitalization and death.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between receipt of 3 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 or Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, stratified by variant (Omicron and Delta). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A test-negative case-control analysis among adults 18 years or older with COVID-like illness tested December 10, 2021, through January 1, 2022, by a national pharmacy-based testing program (4666 COVID-19 testing sites across 49 US states). EXPOSURES: Three doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (third dose ≥14 days before test and ≥6 months after second dose) vs unvaccinated and vs 2 doses 6 months or more before test (ie, eligible for a booster dose). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Association between symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (stratified by Omicron or Delta variants defined using S-gene target failure) and vaccination (3 doses vs unvaccinated and 3 doses vs 2 doses). Associations were measured with multivariable multinomial regression. Among cases, a secondary outcome was median cycle threshold values (inversely proportional to the amount of target nucleic acid present) for 3 viral genes, stratified by variant and vaccination status. RESULTS: Overall, 23 391 cases (13 098 Omicron; 10 293 Delta) and 46 764 controls were included (mean age, 40.3 [SD, 15.6] years; 42 050 [60.1%] women). Prior receipt of 3 mRNA vaccine doses was reported for 18.6% (n = 2441) of Omicron cases, 6.6% (n = 679) of Delta cases, and 39.7% (n = 18 587) of controls; prior receipt of 2 mRNA vaccine doses was reported for 55.3% (n = 7245), 44.4% (n = 4570), and 41.6% (n = 19 456), respectively; and being unvaccinated was reported for 26.0% (n = 3412), 49.0% (n = 5044), and 18.6% (n = 8721), respectively. The adjusted odds ratio for 3 doses vs unvaccinated was 0.33 (95% CI, 0.31-0.35) for Omicron and 0.065 (95% CI, 0.059-0.071) for Delta; for 3 vaccine doses vs 2 doses the adjusted odds ratio was 0.34 (95% CI, 0.32-0.36) for Omicron and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.14-0.17) for Delta. Median cycle threshold values were significantly higher in cases with 3 doses vs 2 doses for both Omicron and Delta (Omicron N gene: 19.35 vs 18.52; Omicron ORF1ab gene: 19.25 vs 18.40; Delta N gene: 19.07 vs 17.52; Delta ORF1ab gene: 18.70 vs 17.28; Delta S gene: 23.62 vs 20.24). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among individuals seeking testing for COVID-like illness in the US in December 2021, receipt of 3 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (compared with unvaccinated and with receipt of 2 doses) was less likely among cases with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with test-negative controls. These findings suggest that receipt of 3 doses of mRNA vaccine, relative to being unvaccinated and to receipt of 2 doses, was associated with protection against both the Omicron and Delta variants, although the higher odds ratios for Omicron suggest less protection for Omicron than for Delta.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1001/jama.2022.0470,"2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273/*administration & dosage;Adolescent;Adult;Aged;BNT162 Vaccine/*administration & dosage;COVID-19/epidemiology/*prevention & control/virology;COVID-19 Vaccines/*administration & dosage;Case-Control Studies;Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic;Humans;Immunization, Secondary;Middle Aged;Odds Ratio;Regression Analysis;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;*SARS-CoV-2;*Vaccine Efficacy;Young Adult;Vaccination;RNA, Messenger",35060999,PMC8848203

Design: Multicenter observational case-control study using the test-negative design to evaluate vaccine effectiveness (VE). Setting: Twenty-one hospitals in the United States (US). Participants: 3,181 adults hospitalized with an acute respiratory illness between December 26, 2021 and April 30, 2022, a period of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (BA.1, BA.2) predominance. Participants included 1,572 (49%) case-patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 and 1,609 (51%) control patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Median age was 64 years, 48% were female, and 21% were immunocompromised; 798 (25%) were vaccinated with a primary series plus booster, 1,326 (42%) were vaccinated with a primary series alone, and 1,057 (33%) were unvaccinated. Main Outcome Measures: VE against COVID-19 hospitalization was calculated for a primary series plus a booster and a primary series alone by comparing the odds of being vaccinated with each of these regimens versus being unvaccinated among cases versus controls. VE analyses were stratified by immune status (immunocompetent; immunocompromised) because the recommended vaccine schedules are different for these groups. The primary analysis evaluated all COVID-19 vaccine types combined and secondary analyses evaluated specific vaccine products. Results: Among immunocompetent patients, VE against Omicron COVID-19 hospitalization for a primary series plus one booster of any vaccine product dose was 77% (95% CI: 71-82%), and for a primary series alone was 44% (95% CI: 31-54%) (p<0.001). VE was higher for a boosted regimen than a primary series alone for both mRNA vaccines used in the US (BNT162b2: primary series plus booster VE 80% (95% CI: 73-85%), primary series alone VE 46% (95% CI: 30-58%) [p<0.001]; mRNA-1273: primary series plus booster VE 77% (95% CI: 67-83%), primary series alone VE 47% (95% CI: 30-60%) [p<0.001]). Among immunocompromised patients, VE for a primary series of any vaccine product against Omicron COVID-19 hospitalization was 60% (95% CI: 41-73%). Insufficient sample size has accumulated to calculate effectiveness of boosted regimens for immunocompromised patients. Conclusions: Among immunocompetent people, a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine provided additional benefit beyond a primary vaccine series alone for preventing COVID-19 hospitalization due to the Omicron variant.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1101/2022.06.09.22276228,Hospital Units;Vaccination;Vaccines;United States,35734090,PMC9216731

While some ""real world"" experiences with various vaccines have been reported, to our knowledge, few have examined comparative outcomes of various vaccines in one country as new SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged. Here we present an analysis of COVID-19 related outcomes from a national database in Bahrain, a country with a total population of 1.51 million, where four vaccines were deployed (total vaccinated = 1,003,960 adults): AstraZeneca (AZ/Covishield), Pfizer/BioNtech, Sinopharm and Sputnik V. We compare the four vaccines, based on the following post-vaccination outcomes: SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalisations, ICU admissions and deaths, compared to unvaccinated individuals. We conclude that the four vaccines used in Bahrain were effective in significantly reducing all four COVID-19 related outcomes compared to unvaccinated individuals, prior to, and during the period when the Delta variant predominated in the country. However, compared to the three other vaccines, individuals vaccinated with Sinopharm vaccine had a higher risk of post-vaccination infections, hospitalisations and ICU admissions (e.g., 6.94%, 2.24%, 1.99% and 1.52% of COVID-19 cases of Sinopharm, Sputnik V, Pfizer and Covishield recipients, respectively, required hospitalisation versus 13.66% of COVID-19 cases among unvaccinated individuals); however, given the confounding factors, this needs to be confirmed by further studies. We find no evidence of biased selection for any vaccine, but note waning protection of the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine during the January to June 2021 period in the age > 60 y cohort; however, this cannot be distinguished from the overall fall in hospitalisations overall. Our findings support the value of vaccination in preventing COVID-19 related outcomes, provide real world estimates on the outcomes and frequencies of post-vaccination infections for the four vaccines, which may inform vaccine selection in the context of the Delta variant across the globe.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1038/s41598-022-12543-4,"Adult;Bahrain/epidemiology;*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines;ChAdOx1 nCoV-19;Humans;*Influenza Vaccines;RNA, Viral;SARS-CoV-2/genetics;Vaccination;Vaccines;Bahrain",35654940,PMC9161761

METHODS: We conducted a national, matched, test-negative, case-control study in Qatar from December 23, 2021, through February 21, 2022, to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna), natural immunity due to previous infection with variants other than omicron, and hybrid immunity (previous infection and vaccination) against symptomatic omicron infection and against severe, critical, or fatal coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). RESULTS: The effectiveness of previous infection alone against symptomatic BA.2 infection was 46.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.5 to 51.9). The effectiveness of vaccination with two doses of BNT162b2 and no previous infection was negligible (-1.1%; 95% CI, -7.1 to 4.6), but nearly all persons had received their second dose more than 6 months earlier. The effectiveness of three doses of BNT162b2 and no previous infection was 52.2% (95% CI, 48.1 to 55.9). The effectiveness of previous infection and two doses of BNT162b2 was 55.1% (95% CI, 50.9 to 58.9), and the effectiveness of previous infection and three doses of BNT162b2 was 77.3% (95% CI, 72.4 to 81.4). Previous infection alone, BNT162b2 vaccination alone, and hybrid immunity all showed strong effectiveness (>70%) against severe, critical, or fatal Covid-19 due to BA.2 infection. Similar results were observed in analyses of effectiveness against BA.1 infection and of vaccination with mRNA-1273. CONCLUSIONS: No discernable differences in protection against symptomatic BA.1 and BA.2 infection were seen with previous infection, vaccination, and hybrid immunity. Vaccination enhanced protection among persons who had had a previous infection. Hybrid immunity resulting from previous infection and recent booster vaccination conferred the strongest protection.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association of vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine with symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections among health care workers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted at a tertiary medical center in Tel Aviv, Israel. Data were collected on symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections confirmed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests in health care workers undergoing regular screening with nasopharyngeal swabs between December 20, 2020, and February 25, 2021. Logistic regression was used to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) comparing the incidence of infection between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated participants, controlling for demographics and the number of PCR tests performed. EXPOSURES: Vaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine vs unvaccinated status was ascertained from the employee health database. Full vaccination was defined as more than 7 days after receipt of the second vaccine dose. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the regression-adjusted IRR for symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection of fully vaccinated vs unvaccinated health care workers. The secondary outcomes included IRRs for partially vaccinated health care workers (days 7-28 after first dose) and for those considered as late fully vaccinated (>21 days after second dose). RESULTS: A total of 6710 health care workers (mean [SD] age, 44.3 [12.5] years; 4465 [66.5%] women) were followed up for a median period of 63 days; 5953 health care workers (88.7%) received at least 1 dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, 5517 (82.2%) received 2 doses, and 757 (11.3%) were not vaccinated. Vaccination was associated with older age compared with those who were not vaccinated (mean age, 44.8 vs 40.7 years, respectively) and male sex (31.4% vs 17.7%). Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 8 fully vaccinated health care workers and 38 unvaccinated health care workers (incidence rate, 4.7 vs 149.8 per 100 000 person-days, respectively, adjusted IRR, 0.03 [95% CI, 0.01-0.06]). Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 19 fully vaccinated health care workers and 17 unvaccinated health care workers (incidence rate, 11.3 vs 67.0 per 100 000 person-days, respectively, adjusted IRR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.07-0.31]). The results were qualitatively unchanged by the propensity score sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among health care workers at a single center in Tel Aviv, Israel, receipt of the BNT162b2 vaccine compared with no vaccine was associated with a significantly lower incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection more than 7 days after the second dose. Findings are limited by the observational design.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1001/jama.2021.7152,Adult;Asymptomatic Infections/epidemiology;BNT162 Vaccine;COVID-19/diagnosis/*epidemiology/prevention & control;*COVID-19 Vaccines;Female;*Health Personnel;Humans;Incidence;Israel;Male;Middle Aged;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Propensity Score;Retrospective Studies;SARS-CoV-2/isolation & purification;Tertiary Care Centers;Vaccination,33956048,PMC8220476

This study aimed to identify risk factors for post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection and describe the characteristics of post-vaccination illness. METHODS: This prospective, community-based, nested, case-control study used self-reported data (eg, on demographics, geographical location, health risk factors, and COVID-19 test results, symptoms, and vaccinations) from UK-based, adult (≥18 years) users of the COVID Symptom Study mobile phone app. For the risk factor analysis, cases had received a first or second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine between Dec 8, 2020, and July 4, 2021; had either a positive COVID-19 test at least 14 days after their first vaccination (but before their second; cases 1) or a positive test at least 7 days after their second vaccination (cases 2); and had no positive test before vaccination. Two control groups were selected (who also had not tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before vaccination): users reporting a negative test at least 14 days after their first vaccination but before their second (controls 1) and users reporting a negative test at least 7 days after their second vaccination (controls 2). Controls 1 and controls 2 were matched (1:1) with cases 1 and cases 2, respectively, by the date of the post-vaccination test, health-care worker status, and sex. In the disease profile analysis, we sub-selected participants from cases 1 and cases 2 who had used the app for at least 14 consecutive days after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 3 and cases 4, respectively). Controls 3 and controls 4 were unvaccinated participants reporting a positive SARS-CoV-2 test who had used the app for at least 14 consecutive days after the test, and were matched (1:1) with cases 3 and 4, respectively, by the date of the positive test, health-care worker status, sex, body-mass index (BMI), and age. We used univariate logistic regression models (adjusted for age, BMI, and sex) to analyse the associations between risk factors and post-vaccination infection, and the associations of individual symptoms, overall disease duration, and disease severity with vaccination status. FINDINGS: Between Dec 8, 2020, and July 4, 2021, 1 240 009 COVID Symptom Study app users reported a first vaccine dose, of whom 6030 (0·5%) subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 1), and 971 504 reported a second dose, of whom 2370 (0·2%) subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 2). In the risk factor analysis, frailty was associated with post-vaccination infection in older adults (≥60 years) after their first vaccine dose (odds ratio [OR] 1·93, 95% CI 1·50-2·48; p<0·0001), and individuals living in highly deprived areas had increased odds of post-vaccination infection following their first vaccine dose (OR 1·11, 95% CI 1·01-1·23; p=0·039). Individuals without obesity (BMI <30 kg/m(2)) had lower odds of infection following their first vaccine dose (OR 0·84, 95% CI 0·75-0·94; p=0·0030). For the disease profile analysis, 3825 users from cases 1 were included in cases 3 and 906 users from cases 2 were included in cases 4. Vaccination (compared with no vaccination) was associated with reduced odds of hospitalisation or having more than five symptoms in the first week of illness following the first or second dose, and long-duration (≥28 days) symptoms following the second dose. Almost all symptoms were reported less frequently in infected vaccinated individuals than in infected unvaccinated individuals, and vaccinated participants were more likely to be completely asymptomatic, especially if they were 60 years or older. INTERPRETATION: To minimise SARS-CoV-2 infection, at-risk populations must be targeted in efforts to boost vaccine effectiveness and infection control measures. Our findings might support caution around relaxing physical distancing and other personal protective measures in the post-vaccination era, particularly around frail older adults and individuals living in more deprived areas, even if these individuals are vaccinated, and might have implications for strategies such as booster vaccinations.

Little information is available on disease severity and vaccine efficacy since the dissemination of the Omicron variant. METHODS: In a multi-center study, during a period of the epidemic driven by the Omicron variant, all hemodialysis patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 were identified. Outcomes were analyzed according to predictor variables including vaccination status. Risk of infection was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was identified in 1126 patients including 200 (18%) unvaccinated, 56 (5%) post first dose, 433 (38%) post second dose, and 437 (39%) at least 7 days beyond their third dose. The majority of patients had a mild course but 160 (14%) were hospitalized and 28 (2%) died. In regression models adjusted for age and comorbidity, two-dose vaccination was associated with a 39% (95%CI: 2%-62%) reduction in admissions, but third doses provided additional protection, with a 51% (95%CI: 25%-69%) further reduction in admissions.

We estimated the VE against referral for hospital admission, COVID-19-related lung injury assessed with LDCT, and decline in oxygen saturation. RESULTS: In the final analysis, 13,893 patients were included, 1291 (9.3%) patients met our criteria for complete vaccination status, and 495 (3.6%) were referred to hospital. In the primary analysis, the adjusted VE against referral to hospital was 81% (95% confidence interval: 68-88) for complete vaccination. The VE against referral to hospital was more pronounced in women (84%, 95% CI: 66-92) compared to men (76%, 95% CI: 51-88). Vaccine protective effect increased with increasing lung injury categories, from 54% (95% CI: 48-60) against any sign of lung injury to 76% (95% CI: 59-86) against more than 50% lung involvement. A sharp increase was observed in the probability of hospital admission with age for non-vaccinated patients in relation to an almost flat relationship for the completely vaccinated group. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccination was effective against referral to hospital in patients with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in St. Petersburg, Russia. This protection is probably mediated through VE against lung injury associated with COVID-19.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1186/s12916-022-02509-8,*COVID-19/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines;Case-Control Studies;Female;Hospitals;Humans;*Lung Injury;Male;Referral and Consultation;SARS-CoV-2;Vaccine Efficacy;Vaccination;Vaccines,36123681,PMC9484844

Vaccination of the elderly and chronically ill was prioritized and the interval between doses set to 12 weeks. The objective of this interim analysis was to evaluate first and second dose vaccine effectiveness (VE) in a real-world setting. METHODS: During the first five months of the campaign, a register-based cohort study was conducted in the Finnish elderly aged 70+ years and those aged 16-69 years with medical conditions predisposing to severe Covid-19 (chronically ill). Using Cox regression, VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection and Covid-19 hospitalisation was estimated comparing the hazard in the vaccinated with that in the unvaccinated. RESULTS: The cohorts included 901092 elderly (89% vaccinated) and 774526 chronically ill (69% vaccinated) individuals. Three weeks after the first dose, mRNA VE against infection was 45% (95% confidence interval, 36-53%) and 40% (26-51%) in elderly and chronically ill; mRNA VE against hospitalisation was 63% (49-74%) and 82% (56-93%). In chronically ill, AdV VE was 42% (32-50) and 62% (42-75%) against infection and hospitalisation, respectively. One week after the second dose, mRNA VE against infection was 75% (65-82%) and 77% (65-85%) in elderly and chronically ill; mRNA VE against hospitalisation was 93% (70-98%) and 90% (29-99%). CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 vaccines protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and Covid-19 hospitalisation. A single dose provides moderate protection in elderly and chronically ill, although two doses are clearly superior.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1371/journal.pone.0258704,"Adolescent;Adult;Age Factors;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;COVID-19/*prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines/*administration & dosage;*Chronic Disease;Cohort Studies;Female;Finland/epidemiology;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;*Treatment Outcome;Young Adult;Chronic Disease;Vaccination",34793476,PMC8601574

METHODS: We conducted a national cohort study of health care workers in Wales (UK) from 7 December 2020 to 30 September 2021. We examined uptake of any COVID-19 vaccine, and the effectiveness of BNT162b2 mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech) against polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We used linked and routinely collected national-scale data within the SAIL Databank. Data were available on 82,959 health care workers in Wales, with exposure extending to 26 weeks after second doses. RESULTS: Overall vaccine uptake was high (90%), with most health care workers receiving theBNT162b2 vaccine (79%). Vaccine uptake differed by age, staff role, socioeconomic status; those aged 50-59 and 60+ years old were 1.6 times more likely to get vaccinated than those aged 16-29. Medical and dental staff, and Allied Health Practitioners were 1.5 and 1.1 times more likely to get vaccinated, compared to nursing and midwifery staff. The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine was found to be strong and consistent across the characteristics considered; 52% three to six weeks after first dose, 86% from two weeks after second dose, though this declined to 53% from 22 weeks after the second dose. CONCLUSIONS: With some variation in rate of uptake, those who were vaccinated had a reduced risk of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to those unvaccinated. Second dose has provided stronger protection for longer than first dose but our study is consistent with waning from seven weeks onwards.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.11.061,Adolescent;Adult;BNT162 Vaccine;*COVID-19;*COVID-19 Vaccines;Cohort Studies;Health Personnel;Humans;Prospective Studies;SARS-CoV-2;Wales/epidemiology;Young Adult;Vaccination;Wales;Vaccines,35042645,PMC8760602

METHODS: In the single-arm, open-label, phase 3B implementation Sisonke study, health-care workers aged 18 years and older were invited for vaccination at one of 122 vaccination sites nationally. Participants received a single dose of 5 × 10(10) viral particles of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. Vaccinated participants were linked with their person-level data from one of two national medical insurance schemes (scheme A and scheme B) and matched for COVID-19 risk with an unvaccinated member of the general population. The primary outcome was vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19, defined as COVID-19-related admission to hospital, hospitalisation requiring critical or intensive care, or death, in health-care workers compared with the general population, ascertained 28 days or more after vaccination or matching, up to data cutoff. This study is registered with the South African National Clinical Trial Registry, DOH-27-022021-6844, ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04838795, and the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, PACTR202102855526180, and is closed to accrual. FINDINGS: Between Feb 17 and May 17, 2021, 477 102 health-care workers were enrolled and vaccinated, of whom 357 401 (74·9%) were female and 119 701 (25·1%) were male, with a median age of 42·0 years (33·0-51·0). 215 813 vaccinated individuals were matched with 215 813 unvaccinated individuals. As of data cutoff (July 17, 2021), vaccine effectiveness derived from the total matched cohort was 83% (95% CI 75-89) to prevent COVID-19-related deaths, 75% (69-82) to prevent COVID-19-related hospital admissions requiring critical or intensive care, and 67% (62-71) to prevent COVID-19-related hospitalisations. The vaccine effectiveness for all three outcomes were consistent across scheme A and scheme B. The vaccine effectiveness was maintained in older health-care workers and those with comorbidities including HIV infection. During the course of the study, the beta (B.1.351) and then the delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns were dominant, and vaccine effectiveness remained consistent (for scheme A plus B vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-related hospital admission during beta wave was 62% [95% CI 42-76] and during delta wave was 67% [62-71], and vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-related death during beta wave was 86% [57-100] and during delta wave was 82% [74-89]). INTERPRETATION: The single-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine shows effectiveness against severe COVID-19 disease and COVID-19-related death after vaccination, and against both beta and delta variants, providing real-world evidence for its use globally.

The study aimed to estimate the effectiveness of the inactivated Covid-19 vaccine BBIBP-CorV (Vero Cells) Sinopharm vaccine currently deployed in Morocco against SARS- CoV-2 severe disease/ hospitalization"" within 9 months after vaccination. METHODS: We conducted a test-negative, case-control study among a population aged 18 years or older who were tested by rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection from February to October 2021 in Morocco. From the national laboratory COVID-19 database; we identified cases who were rt-PCR positive amongst severe and critical COVID-19 cases and controls who had a negative rt-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. From the national vaccination register (NVR); individuals vaccinated with COVID-19 Vaccine (Vero Cell) and those unvaccinated were identified and included in the study. The linkage between databases was conducted for the study of Vaccination status based on the timing of the vaccine receipt relative to the SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR test date. For each person, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, we identified a propensity score-matched control participant who was tested negative. We estimated vaccine effectiveness against SARS- CoV-2 severe disease/ hospitalization using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 12884 persons who tested positive and 12885 propensity score-matched control participants, the median age was 62 years, 47.2% of whom were female. As a function of time after vaccination of second dose vaccination, vaccine effectiveness during the first month was 88% (95% CI, 84-91), 87% (95% CI: 83-90) during the second and third month, 75% (95% CI: 67-80) during the fourth month, 61% (95% CI: 54-67) during the fifth month, and 64% (95% CI: 59-69) beyond the sixth month. VE remained high and stable during the first three months in the two-age subgroup. In the fourth month, the VE in the older population aged 60 years and above (64%) was reduced by 20 points compared to VE in the younger population (84%).

We investigated the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on the incidence of infection, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 infection. METHODS: The study design was an observational data linkage cohort study. Multiple health care datasets were linked to ascertain all SARS-CoV-2 testing, vaccination, hospitalization, and mortality data for all patients treated with KRT in Scotland from the start of the pandemic over a period of 20 months. Descriptive statistics, survival analyses, and vaccine effectiveness were calculated. RESULTS: As of September 19, 2021, 93% (n=5281) of the established KRT population in Scotland had received two doses of an approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Over the study period, there were 814 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (15.1% of the KRT population). Vaccine effectiveness rates against infection and hospitalization were 33% (95% CI, 0 to 52) and 38% (95% CI, 0 to 57), respectively. Within 28 days of a SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR test, 9.2% of fully vaccinated individuals died (7% patients on dialysis and 10% kidney transplant recipients).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults, the OR for the association between symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination (as an estimate of vaccine effectiveness) was higher during Delta variant predominance, suggesting lower protection. For mRNA vaccination, the steady increase in OR by month since vaccination was consistent with attenuation of estimated effectiveness over time; attenuation related to time was greater than that related to variant.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1001/jama.2022.2068,Adolescent;Adult;COVID-19/*prevention & control/*virology;*COVID-19 Vaccines;Case-Control Studies;Child;Female;Humans;Male;*SARS-CoV-2;Time Factors;Young Adult;Vaccination,35157002,PMC8845038

Primary outcome was death or ventilation.ResultsWe included 343 VD, 162 ND and 172 VA patients. VD were more likely older (OR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.05-1.08), men (OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.0-2.5) and immunosuppressed (OR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.1-5.5) vs ND. Median time between second vaccine dose and admission was 179 days (IQR: 166-187) in VD vs 41 days (IQR: 28-57.5) in VA. VD patients were less likely to be men (OR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4-0.9), immunosuppressed (OR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.2-0.5) or have congestive heart failure (OR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.3-0.9) vs VA. The outcome was similar between all cohorts and affected by age and immunosuppression and not by vaccination, variant or time from vaccination.ConclusionsVaccination was protective during the Delta variant wave, as suggested by older age and greater immunosuppression in vaccinated breakthrough vs unvaccinated inpatients. Nevertheless, compared with an earlier post-vaccination period, breakthrough infections 6 months post-vaccination occurred in healthier patients. Thus, waning immunity increased vulnerability during the Delta wave, which suggests boosters as a countermeasure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.20.2101026,*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines;Cohort Studies;Female;Humans;Israel/epidemiology;Male;*SARS-CoV-2;Vaccination;Israel,35593161,PMC9121662

In the present investigation, mRNA and vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were analysed with respect to postvaccination infections in vaccinated hospital employees. METHODS: A total of 8553 staff members were vaccinated with BNT162b2 (47%) or ChAdOx1-S (53%) between January and May 2021. In a retrospective observational cohort study, incidence of SARS-CoV-2 postvaccination infections was analysed in relation to demographic data, viral load, virus variants, vaccine brand and vaccination status at time of positive PCR test (fully vaccinated: ≥14 days since second dose; partially vaccinated: >21 days since first, but <14 days after second dose; insufficiently vaccinated: <22 days since first dose). RESULTS: Within the follow-up period, ending on 31 July 2021, person-time at risk-adjusted monthly rates for SARS-CoV-2 postvaccination infections were 0.18% (BNT162b2) and 0.57% (ChAdOx1-S) for insufficiently vaccinated, 0.34% (BNT162b2) and 0.32% (ChAdOx1-S) for partially vaccinated and 0.06% (BNT162b2) and 0.04% (ChAdOx1-S) for fully vaccinated participants. The two vaccine types did not differ with respect to hazard ratios for any of the respective postvaccination infection types. No cases of COVID-19-related hospitalizations or deaths were reported.

We conducted a prospective cohort study at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) to determine the real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE) of mRNA-1273 in preventing COVID-19 infection and severe disease. METHODS: For this planned interim analysis, individuals aged ≥18 years receiving 2 doses of mRNA-1273 ≥24 days apart (18/12/2020-31/03/2021) were 1:1 matched to randomly selected unvaccinated individuals by age, sex, and race/ethnicity, with follow-up through 30/06/2021. Outcomes were COVID-19 infection (SARS-CoV-2 positive molecular test or COVID-19 diagnosis code) or severe disease (COVID-19 hospitalization and COVID-19 hospital death). Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and confidence intervals (CI) for COVID-19 outcomes comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models accounting for multiple comparisons. Adjusted VE was calculated as (1-aHR)x100. Whole genome sequencing was performed on SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens from the KPSC population. FINDINGS: This analysis included 352,878 recipients of 2 doses of mRNA-1273 matched to 352,878 unvaccinated individuals. VE (99·3% CI) against COVID-19 infection was 87·4% (84·8-89·6%). VE against COVID-19 hospitalization and hospital death was 95·8% (90·7-98·1%) and 97·9% (66·9-99·9%), respectively. VE was higher against symptomatic (88·3% [98·3% CI: 86·1-90·2%]) than asymptomatic COVID-19 (72·7% [53·4-84·0%]), but was generally similar across age, sex, and racial/ethnic subgroups. VE among individuals with history of COVID-19 ranged from 8·2-33·6%. The most prevalent variants were Alpha (41·6%), Epsilon (17·5%), Delta (11·5%), and Gamma (9·1%), with Delta increasing to 54·0% of variants by June 2021. INTERPRETATION: These interim results provide reassuring evidence of the VE of 2 doses of mRNA-1273 across age, sex, and racial/ethnic subgroups, and against asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19, and severe COVID-19 outcomes. Among individuals with history of COVID-19, mRNA-1273 vaccination may offer added protection beyond immunity acquired from prior infection.

With recent resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 cases, the role of booster doses of the vaccine needs to be highlighted. METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort study design emulating a target trial, we determined the relative vaccine effectiveness (RVE) of a homologous booster dose of a SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine compared with the primary vaccine series alone in preventing infection, hospitalization, and intensive care unit admission, and death in the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system in the United States. Among infection-free survivors who received 2 doses of a mRNA vaccine before 30 April 2021, we identified those who received a booster between 22 September and 25 December 2021 and matched them 1:1 with individuals who did not receive a booster. RESULTS: Among 2 384 272 previously uninfected persons with 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine by 30 April 2021, we identified 462 950 booster recipients between 22 September and 25 December 2021, who were matched 1:1 with non-booster recipients. The RVE (95% confidence interval) was 19% (17%-22%) for confirmed infection, 52% (46%-57%) for hospitalization, and 83% (65%-92%) for intensive care unit admission or death. Recipients of the mRNA-1273 vaccine had a lower cumulative incidence of infections and hospitalizations than recipients of the BNT162b2 vaccine (log-rank P <.001 for both comparisons).

We estimated 1- and 2-dose mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Québec, Canada, including protection against varying outcome severity, variants of concern (VOCs), and the stability of single-dose protection up to 16 weeks postvaccination. METHODS: A test-negative design compared vaccination among SARS-CoV-2 test-positive and weekly matched (10:1), randomly sampled, test-negative HCWs using linked surveillance and immunization databases. Vaccine status was defined by 1 dose ≥14 days or 2 doses ≥7 days before illness onset or specimen collection. Adjusted VE was estimated by conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Primary analysis included 5316 cases and 53 160 controls. Single-dose VE was 70% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68%-73%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection; 73% (95% CI, 71%-75%) against illness; and 97% (95% CI, 92%-99%) against hospitalization. Two-dose VE was 86% (95% CI, 81%-90%) and 93% (95% CI, 89%-95%), respectively, with no hospitalizations. VE was higher for non-VOCs than VOCs (73% Alpha) among single-dose recipients but not 2-dose recipients. Across 16 weeks, no decline in single-dose VE was observed, with appropriate stratification based upon prioritized vaccination determined by higher vs lower likelihood of direct patient contact. CONCLUSIONS: One mRNA vaccine dose provided substantial and sustained protection to HCWs extending at least 4 months postvaccination.

We aimed to estimate the protection against omicron BA.2 associated with previous primary infection with omicron BA.1 or pre-omicron SARS-CoV-2, among health-care workers with and without mRNA vaccination. METHODS: We conducted a test-negative case-control study among health-care workers aged 18 years or older who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in Quebec, Canada, between March 27 and June 4, 2022, when BA.2 was the predominant variant and was presumptively diagnosed with a positive test result. We identified cases (positive test during study period) and controls (negative test during study period) using the provincial laboratory database that records all nucleic acid amplification testing for SARS-CoV-2 in Quebec, and used the provincial immunisation registry to determine vaccination status. Logistic regression models compared the likelihood of BA.2 infection or reinfection (second positive test ≥30 days after primary infection) among health-care workers who had previous primary infection and none to three mRNA vaccine doses versus unvaccinated health-care workers with no primary infection. FINDINGS: 258 007 SARS-CoV-2 tests were done during the study period. Among those with a valid result and that met the inclusion criteria, there were 37 732 presumed BA.2 cases (2521 [6·7%] reinfections following pre-omicron primary infection and 659 [1·7%] reinfections following BA.1 primary infection) and 73 507 controls (7360 [10·0%] had pre-omicron primary infection and 12 315 [16·8%] had BA.1 primary infection). Pre-omicron primary infection was associated with a 38% (95% CI 19-53) reduction in BA.2 infection risk, with higher BA.2 protection among those who had also received one (56%, 95% CI 47-63), two (69%, 64-73), or three (70%, 66-74) mRNA vaccine doses. Omicron BA.1 primary infection was associated with greater protection against BA.2 infection (risk reduction of 72%, 95% CI 65-78), and protection was increased further among those who had received two doses of mRNA vaccine (96%, 95-96), but was not improved with a third dose (96%, 95-97). INTERPRETATION: Health-care workers who had received two doses of mRNA vaccine and had previous BA.1 infection were subsequently well protected for a prolonged period against BA.2 reinfection, with a third vaccine dose conferring no improvement to that hybrid protection. If this protection also pertains to future variants, there might be limited benefit from additional vaccine doses for people with hybrid immunity, depending on timing and variant.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The risk of a positive polymerase chain reaction test result for SARS-CoV-2 during an infant's first 4 months of life by maternal vaccination status during pregnancy with either dose 2 or 3 was estimated, as stratified by periods dominated by the Delta variant (between September 1 and December 31, 2021) or Omicron variant (after January 1, 2022, to the end of follow-up on April 4, 2022). A Cox proportional hazard regression was used, adjusting for maternal age, parity, education, maternal country of birth, and county of residence. RESULTS: Of 21 643 live-born infants, 9739 (45.0%) were born to women who received a second or third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy. The first 4 months of life incidence rate of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 was 5.8 per 10 000 follow-up days. Infants of mothers vaccinated during pregnancy had a lower risk of a positive test compared with infants of unvaccinated mothers and lower risk during the Delta variant-dominated period (incidence rate, 1.2 vs 3.0 per 10 000 follow-up days; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.19-0.46) compared with the Omicron period (incidence rate, 7.0 vs 10.9 per 10 000 follow-up days; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.57-0.79). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this Norwegian population-based cohort study suggested a lower risk of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 during the first 4 months of life among infants born to mothers who were vaccinated during pregnancy. Maternal COVID-19 vaccination may provide passive protection to young infants, for whom COVID-19 vaccines are currently not available.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1001/jamainternmed.2022.2442,"*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines;Cohort Studies;Female;Humans;Incidence;Infant;*Influenza Vaccines;*Influenza, Human/prevention & control;Pandemics;Pregnancy;*Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/epidemiology/prevention & control;SARS-CoV-2/genetics;Vaccination;Vaccines",35648413,PMC9161123

Design: Dynamic Cohort study of HCWs (N = 7723) of the University Health Agency Giuliano Isontina (ASUGI), covering health services of the provinces of Trieste and Gorizia (Northeast Italy). Cox proportional hazard model was employed to estimate the risk of primary as well as recurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection from 1 December 2021 through 31 May 2022, adjusting for a number of confounding factors. Results: By 1 December 2021, 46.8% HCWs of ASUGI had received the booster, 37.2% were immunized only with two doses of COVID-19 vaccines, 6.0% only with one dose and 10.0% were unvaccinated. During 1 March 2020-31 May 2022, 3571 primary against 406 SARS-CoV-2 recurrent infections were counted among HCWs of ASUGI, 59.7% (=2130/3571) versus 95.1% (=386/406) of which occurring from 1 December 2021 through 31 May 2022, respectively. All HCWs infected by SARS-CoV-2 during 1 December 2021 through 31 May 2022 presented mild flu-like disease. Compared to staff working in administrative services, the risk of primary as well as recurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection increased in HCWs with patient-facing clinical tasks (especially nurses and other categories of HCWs) and in all clinical wards but COVID-19 units and community health services. Regardless of the number of swab tests performed during the study period, primary infections were less likely in HCWs immunized with one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. By contrast, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 re-infection was significantly lower in HCWs immunized with three doses (aHR = 0.58; 95%CI: 0.41; 0.80). During the study period, vaccine effectiveness (VE = 1-aHR) of the booster dose declined to 42% against re-infections, vanishing against primary SARS-CoV-2 infections. Conclusions: Though generally mild, SARS-CoV-2 infections and re-infections surged during the Omicron transmission period. Compared to unvaccinated colleagues, the risk of primary SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly lower in HCWs immunized just with one dose of COVID-19 vaccines. By Italian law, HCWs immunized only with one dose were either suspended or re-assigned to job tasks not entailing patient facing contact; hence, while sharing the same biological risk of unvaccinated colleagues, they arguably had a higher level of protection against COVID-19 infection. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 re-infections were less likely in HCWs vaccinated with three doses, suggesting that hybrid humoral immunity by vaccination combined with natural infection provided a higher level of protection than vaccination only. In this stage of the pandemic, where SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious yet much less pathogenic, health protection measures in healthcare premises at higher biological risk seem the rational approach to control the transmission of the virus.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.3390/v14122688,Humans;*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines;Reinfection/epidemiology/prevention & control;Vaccine Efficacy;SARS-CoV-2;Cohort Studies;Health Personnel;Italy/epidemiology;Italy;Vaccination;Vaccines,36560692,PMC9784665

We estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection for the BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and ChAdOx1 vaccines among a population-based cohort of people with HIV in Ontario, Canada. DESIGN: Test-negative design. METHODS: We identified people with HIV aged ≥19 years who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR between December 14, 2020 (first availability of COVID-19 vaccines) and November 21, 2021 (pre-Omicron circulation). Outcomes included any infection, symptomatic infection, and COVID-19-related hospitalization/death. We compared the odds of vaccination between test-positive cases and test-negative controls using multivariable logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, region, calendar time, SARS-CoV-2 test histories, influenza vaccination, comorbidities, and neighborhood-level socio-economic status. VE was derived as (1 - adjusted odds ratio) × 100%. RESULTS: Among 21 023 adults living with HIV, there were 801 (8.3%) test-positive cases and 8,879 (91.7%) test-negative controls. 20.1% cases and 47.8% of controls received ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose; among two-dose recipients, 93.4% received ≥1 mRNA dose. Two-dose VE ≥7 days before specimen collection was 82% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 74-87%) against any infection, 94% (95% CI = 82-98%) against symptomatic infection, and 97% (95% CI = 85-100%) against hospitalization/death. Against any infection, VE declined from 86% (95% CI = 77-92%) within 7-59 days after the second dose to 66% (95% CI = -15-90%) after ≥180 days; we did not observe evidence of waning protection for other outcomes. CONCLUSION: Two doses of COVID-19 vaccine offered substantial protection against symptomatic illness and hospitalization/death in people with HIV prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant. Our findings do not support a broad conclusion that COVID-19 VE is lower among people with HIV in populations that, for the most part, are attending HIV care, taking antiretroviral medication, and are virally suppressed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1097/QAD.0000000000003405,"Adult;Humans;*Influenza Vaccines;COVID-19 Vaccines;*Influenza, Human/prevention & control;*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;BNT162 Vaccine;Vaccine Efficacy;SARS-CoV-2;*HIV Infections/complications/drug therapy;Ontario/epidemiology;Vaccination;Vaccines",36254892,PMC9696686

However, vaccine effectiveness data are limited from Sub-Saharan Africa. We report COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against progression to in-hospital mortality in Zambia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among admitted patients at 8 COVID-19 treatment centers across Zambia during April 2021 through March 2022, when the Delta and Omicron variants were circulating. Patient demographic and clinical information including vaccination status and hospitalization outcome (discharged or died) were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the odds of in-hospital mortality by vaccination status, adjusted for age, sex, number of comorbid conditions, disease severity, hospitalization month, and COVID-19 treatment center. Vaccine effectiveness of ≥1 vaccine dose was calculated from the adjusted odds ratio. RESULTS: Among 1653 patients with data on their vaccination status and hospitalization outcome, 365 (22.1%) died. Overall, 236 (14.3%) patients had received ≥1 vaccine dose before hospital admission. Of the patients who had received ≥1 vaccine dose, 22 (9.3%) died compared with 343 (24.2%) among unvaccinated patients (P < .01). The median time since receipt of a first vaccine dose (interquartile range) was 52.5 (28-107) days.

CONCLUSIONS: Among patients admitted to COVID-19 treatment centers in Zambia, COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower progression to in-hospital mortality. These data are consistent with evidence from other countries demonstrating the benefit of COVID-19 vaccination against severe complications.

METHODS: In this nationwide case-control study, cases were SARS-CoV-2 infected adults with onset of symptoms between 14 February and 3 May 2021. Controls were non-infected adults from a national representative panel matched to cases by age, sex, region, population density and calendar week. Participants completed an online questionnaire on recent activity-related exposures and vaccination history. Information about the infecting virus was based on a screening RT-PCR for either B.1.1.7 or B.1.351/P.1 variants. FINDINGS: Included in our analysis were 7 288 adults infected with the original SARS-CoV-2 virus, 31 313 with the B.1.1.7 lineage, 2 550 with B.1.351/P1 lineages, and 3 644 controls.

We assessed VE (vaccine effectiveness) against hospitalisation, length of stay [LOS] >3 days, WHO COVID Score >5 and supplementary oxygen FiO(2) (fraction inspired oxygen) >28%, conducting regression analyses controlling for age, gender, index of multiple deprivation, Charlson comorbidity index, time, and community infection prevalence. FINDINGS: 935 controls and 546 cases were hospitalised during the Delta period, with 721 controls and 372 cases hospitalised during the Omicron study period.

METHODS: We used a matched test-negative, case-control study design to estimate vaccine effectiveness against any SARS-CoV-2 infection and against any severe, critical, or fatal case of Covid-19, from January 1 to September 5, 2021. RESULTS: Estimated BNT162b2 effectiveness against any SARS-CoV-2 infection was negligible in the first 2 weeks after the first dose. It increased to 36.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 33.2 to 40.2) in the third week after the first dose and reached its peak at 77.5% (95% CI, 76.4 to 78.6) in the first month after the second dose. Effectiveness declined gradually thereafter, with the decline accelerating after the fourth month to reach approximately 20% in months 5 through 7 after the second dose. Effectiveness against symptomatic infection was higher than effectiveness against asymptomatic infection but waned similarly. Variant-specific effectiveness waned in the same pattern. Effectiveness against any severe, critical, or fatal case of Covid-19 increased rapidly to 66.1% (95% CI, 56.8 to 73.5) by the third week after the first dose and reached 96% or higher in the first 2 months after the second dose; effectiveness persisted at approximately this level for 6 months.

METHODS: We assessed the real-world effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine against infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among children and adolescents in Qatar. To compare the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the national cohort of vaccinated participants with the incidence in the national cohort of unvaccinated participants, we conducted three matched, retrospective, target-trial, cohort studies - one assessing data obtained from children 5 to 11 years of age after the B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant became prevalent and two assessing data from adolescents 12 to 17 years of age before the emergence of the omicron variant (pre-omicron study) and after the omicron variant became prevalent. Associations were estimated with the use of Cox proportional-hazards regression models. RESULTS: Among children, the overall effectiveness of the 10-μg primary vaccine series against infection with the omicron variant was 25.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.0 to 38.6). Effectiveness was highest (49.6%; 95% CI, 28.5 to 64.5) right after receipt of the second dose but waned rapidly thereafter and was negligible after 3 months. Effectiveness was 46.3% (95% CI, 21.5 to 63.3) among children 5 to 7 years of age and 16.6% (95% CI, -4.2 to 33.2) among those 8 to 11 years of age. Among adolescents, the overall effectiveness of the 30-μg primary vaccine series against infection with the omicron variant was 30.6% (95% CI, 26.9 to 34.1), but many adolescents had been vaccinated months earlier. Effectiveness waned over time since receipt of the second dose. Effectiveness was 35.6% (95% CI, 31.2 to 39.6) among adolescents 12 to 14 years of age and 20.9% (95% CI, 13.8 to 27.4) among those 15 to 17 years of age. In the pre-omicron study, the overall effectiveness of the 30-μg primary vaccine series against SARS-CoV-2 infection among adolescents was 87.6% (95% CI, 84.0 to 90.4) and waned relatively slowly after receipt of the second dose. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination in children was associated with modest, rapidly waning protection against omicron infection. Vaccination in adolescents was associated with stronger, more durable protection, perhaps because of the larger antigen dose.

We compared protection conferred by natural infection versus that from the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines in Qatar. METHODS: We conducted two matched retrospective cohort studies that emulated target trials. Data were obtained from the national federated databases for COVID-19 vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 testing, and COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death between Feb 28, 2020 (pandemic onset in Qatar) and May 12, 2022. We matched individuals with a documented primary infection and no vaccination record (natural infection cohort) with individuals who had received two doses (primary series) of the same vaccine (BNT162b2-vaccinated or mRNA-1273-vaccinated cohorts) at the start of follow-up (90 days after the primary infection). Individuals were exact matched (1:1) by sex, 10-year age group, nationality, comorbidity count, and timing of primary infection or first-dose vaccination. Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death in the natural infection cohorts was compared with incidence in the vaccinated cohorts, using Cox proportional hazards regression models with adjustment for matching factors. FINDINGS: Between Jan 5, 2021 (date of second-dose vaccine roll-out) and May 12, 2022, 104 500 individuals vaccinated with BNT162b2 and 61 955 individuals vaccinated with mRNA-1273 were matched to unvaccinated individuals with a documented primary infection. During follow-up, 7123 SARS-CoV-2 infections were recorded in the BNT162b2-vaccinated cohort and 3583 reinfections were recorded in the matched natural infection cohort. 4282 SARS-CoV-2 infections were recorded in the mRNA-1273-vaccinated cohort and 2301 reinfections were recorded in the matched natural infection cohort. The overall adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0·47 (95% CI 0·45-0·48) after previous natural infection versus BNT162b2 vaccination, and 0·51 (0·49-0·54) after previous natural infection versus mRNA-1273 vaccination. The overall adjusted HR for severe (acute care hospitalisations), critical (intensive care unit hospitalisations), or fatal COVID-19 cases was 0·24 (0·08-0·72) after previous natural infection versus BNT162b2 vaccination, and 0·24 (0·05-1·19) after previous natural infection versus mRNA-1273 vaccination. Severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was rare in both the natural infection and vaccinated cohorts. INTERPRETATION: Previous natural infection was associated with lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of the variant, than mRNA primary-series vaccination. Vaccination remains the safest and most optimal tool for protecting against infection and COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death, irrespective of previous infection status.

We aim to study if vaccination alters virological and serological kinetics in breakthrough infections. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre retrospective cohort study of patients in Singapore who had received a licensed mRNA vaccine and been admitted to hospital with B.1.617.2 SARS-CoV-2 infection. We compared clinical features, virological and serological kinetics (anti-nucleocapsid, anti-spike and surrogate virus neutralization titres) between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. RESULTS: Out of 218 individuals with B.1.617.2 infection, 84 received an mRNA vaccine of which 71 were fully vaccinated, 130 were unvaccinated and four received a non-mRNA vaccine. Despite significantly older age in the vaccine breakthrough group, only 2.8% (2/71) developed severe COVID-19 requiring oxygen supplementation compared with 53.1% (69/130) in the unvaccinated group (p < 0.001). Odds of severe COVID-19 following vaccination were significantly lower (adjusted odds ratio 0.07 95% CI 0.015-0.335, p 0.001). PCR cycle threshold values were similar between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups at diagnosis, but viral loads decreased faster in vaccinated individuals. Early, robust boosting of anti-spike protein antibodies was observed in vaccinated patients; however, these titres were significantly lower against B.1.617.2 than the wildtype vaccine strain. DISCUSSION: The mRNA vaccines are highly effective at preventing symptomatic and severe COVID-19 associated with B.1.617.2 infection. Vaccination is associated with faster decline in viral RNA load and a robust serological response. Vaccination remains a key strategy for control of the COVID-19 pandemic.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1016/j.cmi.2021.11.010,"*COVID-19/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines;Cohort Studies;Humans;Kinetics;Pandemics;Retrospective Studies;*SARS-CoV-2/genetics;Vaccination;Vaccines, Synthetic;mRNA Vaccines",34826623,PMC8608661

Literature on the effectiveness of primary series and booster vaccination among adolescents is scarce outside of Europe and North America. We aimed to determine primary series and booster vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalisation among adolescents in Singapore. METHODS: For this national cohort study, we assessed the incidence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalisation among adolescents aged 12-17 years vaccinated with BNT162b2 in Singapore from Sept 1 to Dec 15, 2021, during the delta (B.1.617.2) variant wave, and from Jan 21 to April 28, 2022, during the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant wave. Data were collected from official databases maintained by the Ministry of Health of Singapore. Individuals were classified as partly vaccinated (those who had received one dose and those who had received the second dose no more than 7 days previously), fully vaccinated (8 days after receiving a second dose), or boosted (8 days after receiving a third dose) and compared with unvaccinated individuals. FINDINGS: 249 763 individuals aged 12-17 years were included in the study, contributing over 56·2 million person-days of observation. Compared with unvaccinated individuals, two vaccine doses achieved vaccine effectiveness of 66% (95% CI 63-69) against infection with the delta variant and 25% (21-29) against infection with the omicron variant, and 83% (74-89) against delta variant-associated hospitalisation and 75% (56-86) against omicron variant-associated hospitalisation. Booster vaccination with a third dose achieved vaccine effectiveness of 56% (53-58) against infection with the omicron variant and 94% (86-97) against omicron-associated hospitalisation, compared with unvaccinated adolescents. Vaccine effectiveness against infection for both variants after two doses waned over time, whereas vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation for both variants remained stable; both were increased after three doses. INTERPRETATION: Among adolescents aged 12-17 years, vaccine effectiveness against confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection after two doses of BNT162b2 decreased over time and increased after a third dose. Boosted adolescents were also the most protected from hospitalisation compared with fully vaccinated, partly vaccinated, and unvaccinated adolescents. Therefore, the booster dose of BNT162b2 can help to reduce the burden on the health-care system and individual morbidity during an omicron wave.

METHODS: We evaluated the protection conferred by mRNA vaccines and previous infection against infection with the omicron variant in two high-risk populations: residents and staff in the California state prison system. We used a retrospective cohort design to analyze the risk of infection during the omicron wave using data collected from December 24, 2021, through April 14, 2022. Weighted Cox models were used to compare the effectiveness (measured as 1 minus the hazard ratio) of vaccination and previous infection across combinations of vaccination history (stratified according to the number of mRNA doses received) and infection history (none or infection before or during the period of B.1.617.2 [delta]-variant predominance). A secondary analysis used a rolling matched-cohort design to evaluate the effectiveness of three vaccine doses as compared with two doses. RESULTS: Among 59,794 residents and 16,572 staff, the estimated effectiveness of previous infection against omicron infection among unvaccinated persons who had been infected before or during the period of delta predominance ranged from 16.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.1 to 23.7) to 48.9% (95% CI, 41.6 to 55.3). Depending on previous infection status, the estimated effectiveness of vaccination (relative to being unvaccinated and without previous documented infection) ranged from 18.6% (95% CI, 7.7 to 28.1) to 83.2% (95% CI, 77.7 to 87.4) with two vaccine doses and from 40.9% (95% CI, 31.9 to 48.7) to 87.9% (95% CI, 76.0 to 93.9) with three vaccine doses.

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings in two high-risk populations suggest that mRNA vaccination and previous infection were effective against omicron infection, with lower estimates among those infected before the period of delta predominance.

Study objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of BNT162b2 vaccine in preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality. METHODS: This historical cohort study included members of a large health provider in Israel that were vaccinated with at least 1 dose of BNT162b2. The primary outcome was incidence rate of a SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed with real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR), between 7 and 27 days after second dose (protection-period), as compared to days 1-7 after the first dose, where no protection by the vaccine is assumed (reference-period). RESULTS: Data of 1 178 597 individuals vaccinated with BNT162b2 were analyzed (mean age 47.7 years [SD = 18.1], 48.4% males) of whom 872 454 (74.0%) reached the protection period.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 2,233,399 residents in the Veneto region to assess the reduction in the COVID-19 burden, taking different outcomes into consideration. First, we adopted a non-brand-specific approach borrowed from survival analysis to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in preventing infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. We used t-tests and multivariate regressions to examine vaccine impact on breakthrough infections, in terms of the persistence of positivity and the length of hospital stays. Evidence emerging from this study suggests that unvaccinated individuals are significantly more likely to become infected, need hospitalization, and are at a higher risk of death from COVID-19 than those given at least one dose of vaccine. Cox models indicate that the effectiveness of full vaccination is 88% against infection, 94% against hospitalization, and 95% against death. Multivariate regressions suggest that vaccination is significantly correlated with a shorter period of positivity and shorter hospital stays, with each step toward completion of the vaccination cycle coinciding with a reduction of 3.3 days in the persistence of positivity and 2.3 days in the length of hospital stay.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.3390/vaccines10010107,Length of Stay;Vaccination,35062767,PMC8777781

METHODS: Using data from the largest health care organization in Israel, we identified a cohort of children 5 to 11 years of age who were vaccinated on or after November 23, 2021, and matched them with unvaccinated controls to estimate the vaccine effectiveness of BNT162b2 among newly vaccinated children during the omicron wave. Vaccine effectiveness against documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and symptomatic Covid-19 was estimated after the first and second vaccine doses. The cumulative incidence of each outcome in the two study groups through January 7, 2022, was estimated with the use of the Kaplan-Meier estimator, and vaccine effectiveness was calculated as 1 minus the risk ratio. Vaccine effectiveness was also estimated in age subgroups. RESULTS: Among 136,127 eligible children who had been vaccinated during the study period, 94,728 were matched with unvaccinated controls. The estimated vaccine effectiveness against documented infection was 17% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7 to 25) at 14 to 27 days after the first dose and 51% (95% CI, 39 to 61) at 7 to 21 days after the second dose. The absolute risk difference between the study groups at days 7 to 21 after the second dose was 1905 events per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 1294 to 2440) for documented infection and 599 events per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 296 to 897) for symptomatic Covid-19. The estimated vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic Covid-19 was 18% (95% CI, -2 to 34) at 14 to 27 days after the first dose and 48% (95% CI, 29 to 63) at 7 to 21 days after the second dose. We observed a trend toward higher vaccine effectiveness in the youngest age group (5 or 6 years of age) than in the oldest age group (10 or 11 years of age). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that as omicron was becoming the dominant variant, two doses of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccine provided moderate protection against documented SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptomatic Covid-19 in children 5 to 11 years of age.

As a result, the Israeli Ministry of Health decided to recommend a fourth vaccine dose to medical staff. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefit of a fourth BNT162b2 vaccine dose on the breakthrough infection rate among HCWs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cohort study was performed in January 2022, the first month of the 4-dose vaccination campaign, during a surge of the Omicron variant wave. All health care workers at 11 general hospitals in Israel who had been vaccinated with 3 doses up to September 30, 2021, and had not contracted COVID-19 before the vaccination campaign were included. EXPOSURES: Vaccination with a fourth dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine during January 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Breakthrough COVID-19 infections in 4-dose recipients vs 3-dose recipients measured by a polymerase chain reaction test result positive for SARS-CoV-2. Health care workers were tested based on symptoms or exposure. RESULTS: A total of 29 611 Israeli HCWs (19 381 [65%] female; mean [SD] age, 44 [12] years) had received 3 vaccine doses between August and September 2021; of these, 5331 (18%) received the fourth dose in January 2022 and were not infected by the first week after vaccination. Overall breakthrough infection rates were 368 of 5331 (7%) in the 4-dose group and 4802 of 24280 (20%) in the 3-dose group (relative risk, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.32-0.39). Similar reductions were found in a matched analysis by the exact day of receiving the third vaccine (relative risk, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.54-0.71) and in a time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression model (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.50-0.63). In both groups, no severe disease or death occurred. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, the fourth BNT162b2 vaccine dose resulted in a reduced breakthrough infection rate among hospital staff. This reduction was lower than that observed after the third dose; nevertheless, considering the high infectivity of the Omicron variant, which led to critical medical staff shortages, a fourth vaccine dose should be considered to mitigate the infection rate among HCWs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.24657,"Attitude of Health Personnel;BNT162 Vaccine;*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines;Child;Cohort Studies;Female;Humans;*Influenza Vaccines;*Influenza, Human/prevention & control;Israel/epidemiology;Male;Personnel, Hospital;SARS-CoV-2;Surveys and Questionnaires;Vaccination;Israel;Vaccines",35917125,PMC9346545

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between regular physical activity and vaccination against COVID-19 among healthcare workers. METHODS: A test negative case-control study design was used to estimate the risk of having an associated COVID-19-related hospital admission, among individuals who were unvaccinated compared with those who were fully vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S (>28 days after a single dose). 196 444 participant tests were stratified into three measured physical activity subgroups with low, moderate and high activity, to test the hypothesis that physical activity is an effect modifier on the relationship between vaccination and hospitalisation. RESULTS: Vaccine effectiveness against a COVID-19-related admission among vaccinated individuals within the low activity group was 60.0% (95% CI 39.0 to 73.8), 72.1% (95% CI 55.2 to 82.6) for the moderate activity group, and 85.8% (95% CI 74.1 to 92.2) for the high activity group. Compared with individuals with low activity levels, vaccinated individuals with moderate and high activity levels had a 1.4 (95% CI 1.36 to 1.51) and 2.8 (95% CI 2.35 to 3.35) times lower risk of COVID-19 admission, respectively (p value <0.001 for both groups). CONCLUSIONS: Regular physical activity was associated with improved vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 hospitalisation, with higher levels of physical activity associated with greater vaccine effectiveness. Physical activity enhances vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19 outcomes and should be encouraged by greater public health messaging.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1136/bjsports-2022-105734,Humans;*SARS-CoV-2;*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;Ad26COVS1;Case-Control Studies;South Africa/epidemiology;Vaccination;Exercise;Motor Activity;Vaccines,36280289,

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the Johnson & Johnson Ad26.COV2.S vaccine for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness research study used large-scale longitudinal curation of electronic health records from the multistate Mayo Clinic Health System (Minnesota, Arizona, Florida, Wisconsin, and Iowa) to identify vaccinated and unvaccinated adults between February 27 and July 22, 2021. The unvaccinated cohort was matched on a propensity score derived from age, sex, zip code, race, ethnicity, and previous number of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction tests. The final study cohort consisted of 8889 patients in the vaccinated group and 88 898 unvaccinated matched patients. EXPOSURE: Single dose of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The incidence rate ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the vaccinated vs unvaccinated control cohorts, measured by SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction testing. RESULTS: The study was composed of 8889 vaccinated patients (4491 men [50.5%]; mean [SD] age, 52.4 [16.9] years) and 88 898 unvaccinated patients (44 748 men [50.3%]; mean [SD] age, 51.7 [16.7] years). The incidence rate ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the vaccinated vs unvaccinated control cohorts was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.20-0.34) (60 of 8889 vaccinated patients vs 2236 of 88 898 unvaccinated individuals), which corresponds to an effectiveness of 73.6% (95% CI, 65.9%-79.9%) and a 3.73-fold reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infections. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study's findings are consistent with the clinical trial-reported efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S and the first retrospective analysis, suggesting that the vaccine is effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection, even with the spread of variants such as Alpha or Delta that were not present in the original studies, and reaffirm the urgent need to continue mass vaccination efforts globally.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.32540,Ad26COVS1;Adolescent;Adult;Aged;COVID-19/diagnosis/epidemiology/immunology/*prevention & control;COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing;COVID-19 Vaccines/administration & dosage/*immunology;Drug Evaluation;Female;Humans;Incidence;Male;Middle Aged;Pandemics;Propensity Score;Retrospective Studies;SARS-CoV-2;Severity of Illness Index;Time Factors;United States/epidemiology;Vaccination/statistics & numerical data;Young Adult;Vaccination;Vaccines,34726743,PMC8564583

We investigated the effect of time since vaccine completion on the SARS-CoV-2 infection and its severe forms. METHODS: In this retrospective observational analysis using the vaccination campaign integrated platform of the Italian region of Lombardy, 5 351 085 individuals aged 12 years or older who received complete vaccination from Jan 17 to July 31, 2021, were followed up from 14 days after vaccine completion until Oct 20, 2021. Changes over time in outcome rates (ie, SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe illness among vaccinated individuals) were analysed with age-period-cohort models. Trends in vaccine effectiveness (ie, outcomes comparison in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals) were also measured. FINDINGS: Overall, 14 140 infections and 2450 severe illnesses were documented, corresponding to incidence rates of 6·7 (95% CI 6·6-6·8) and 1·2 (1·1-1·2) cases per 10 000 person-months, respectively. From the first to the ninth month since vaccine completion, rates increased from 4·6 to 10·2 infections, and from 1·0 to 1·7 severe illnesses every 10 000 person-months. These figures correspond to relative reduction of vaccine effectiveness of 54·9% (95% CI 48·3-60·6) for infection and of 40·0% (16·2-57·0) for severe illness. The increasing infection rate was greater for individuals aged 60 years or older who received adenovirus-vectored vaccines (from 4·0 to 23·5 cases every 10 000 person-months). The increasing severe illness rates were similar for individuals receiving mRNA-based vaccines (from 1·1 to 1·5 every 10 000 person-months) and adenovirus-vectored vaccines (from 0·5 to 0·9 every 10 000 person-months). INTERPRETATION: Although the risk of infection after vaccination, and even more of severe illness, remains low, the gradual increase in clinical outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that the booster campaign should be accelerated and that social and individual protection measures against COVID-19 spread should not be abandoned.

We hereby aim to investigate whether the risk of severe and moderate systemic symptoms (MSS) after vaccination is higher in HCWs with a history of previous COVID-19. METHODS: An online questionnaire was offered to the cohort all HCWs undergoing anti-SARS CoV-2 mRNA BNT162b2 vaccination between January 4th and February 9th 2021 in two large tertiary hospitals (ASST Santi Paolo and Carlo) in Milan, Italy. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 was recorded. Local and systemic symptoms after each of the two doses were reported. MSS were those either interfering with daily activities or resulting in time off-work. Factors associated to MSS were identified by logistic regression. FINDINGS: 3,078 HCW were included. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 occurred in 396 subjects (12·9%). 59·6% suffered from ≥1 local or systemic symptom after the first and 73·4% after the second dose. MSS occurred in 6·3% of cases (14·4% with previous vs 5·1% with no COVID-19 p<0·001) and in 28·3% (24·5% in COVID-19 vs 28·3% no COVID, p = 0·074) after the first and second dose, respectively. Subjects already experiencing COVID-19 had an independent 3-fold higher risk of MSS after the first and a 30% lower risk after the second dose. No severe adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Our data confirm in a real-world setting, the lack of severe adverse events and the short duration of reactogenicity in already infected HCWs. Possible differences in immune reactivity are drivers of MSS among this group of HCWs, as well as among females and younger individuals.

The results of the phase 3 trial have shown clinical efficacy of BBV152. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of BBV152 against symptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We conducted a test-negative, case-control study among employees of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India), who had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and had an RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the peak of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India between April 15 and May 15, 2021. Cases (test-positives) and controls (test-negatives) were matched (1:1) on the basis of age and gender. The odds of vaccination with BBV152 were compared between cases and controls and adjusted for level of occupational exposure (to COVID-19), previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and calendar time, using conditional logistic regression. The primary outcome was effectiveness of two doses of BBV152 (with the second dose received at least 14 days before testing) in reducing the odds of symptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, expressed as (1 - odds ratio) × 100%. FINDINGS: Between April 15 and May 15, 2021, 3732 individuals had an RT-PCR test. Of these, 2714 symptomatic employees had data on vaccination status, and 1068 matched case-control pairs were available for analysis. The adjusted effectiveness of BBV152 against symptomatic COVID-19 after two doses administered at least 14 days before testing was 50% (95% CI 33-62; p<0·0001). The adjusted effectiveness of two doses administered at least 28 days before testing was 46% (95% CI 22-62) and administered at least 42 days before testing was 57% (21-76). After excluding participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 infections, the adjusted effectiveness of two doses administered at least 14 days before testing was 47% (95% CI 29-61). INTERPRETATION: This study shows the effectiveness of two doses of BBV152 against symptomatic COVID-19 in the context of a huge surge in cases, presumably dominated by the potentially immune-evasive delta (B.1.617.2) variant of SARS-CoV-2.

A recently published, population-based, case-control study reported a reduced vaccine efficacy at 3-6 months in cancer patients compared to individuals without cancer. Objectives: The aim of the study was to describe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) outcomes in cancer patients and analyze differences in SARS-CoV-2 outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Methods: Descriptive statistics and frequency counts were used to summarize characteristics of the study population. χ(2) test and the log-rank test were used to compare outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Results: A total of 141 cancer patients (80 males, 61 females) were recruited at two participating Institutions from March 2020 until April 2022 and observed from the time of positive SARS-CoV-2 test to the time of negativization or death. Approximately 35% of patients had been vaccinated at the time of infection with 2 (16 patients) or 3 (33 patients) vaccine doses. Vaccinated patients consistently and significantly showed improved COVID-19 outcomes compared to unvaccinated patients, with CT-diagnosed pneumonia, hospitalization, O(2) therapy, and death reported in 0% versus 48.6%, 2.0% versus 15.2%, 0% versus 14.1%, and 0% versus 7.6%, respectively, of assessable patients (p &#x3c; 0.05).

In this scenario of high SARS-CoV-2 circulation, we analyzed the effectiveness of the country's vaccination strategy that used 7 different vaccines from around the world, and focused on vaccinating the oldest population first. We analyzed the national dataset published by Mexican health authorities, as a retrospective cohort, separating cases, hospitalizations, deaths and excess deaths by wave and age group. We explored if the vaccination strategy was effective to limit severe COVID-19 during the active outbreaks caused by Delta and Omicron variants. Vaccination of the eldest third of the population reduced COVID-19 hospitalizations, deaths and excess deaths by 46-55% in the third wave driven by Delta SARS-CoV-2. These adverse outcomes dropped 74-85% by the fourth wave driven by Omicron, when all adults had access to vaccines. Vaccine access for the pregnant resulted in 85-90% decrease in COVID-19 fatalities in pregnant individuals and 80% decrease in infants 0 years old by the Omicron wave. In contrast, in the rest of the pediatric population that did not access vaccination before the period analyzed, COVID-19 hospitalizations increased >40% during the Delta and Omicron waves. Our analysis suggests that the vaccination strategy in Mexico has been successful to limit population mortality and decrease severe COVID-19, but children in Mexico still need access to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to limit severe COVID-19, in particular those 1-4 years old.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.3389/fpubh.2022.1010256,"*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines;Child;Child, Preschool;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Mexico/epidemiology;Retrospective Studies;*SARS-CoV-2;Vaccination;Mexico",36176536,PMC9513220

We conducted a Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) study during the B.1.617.2 Delta variant phase of the pandemic in July and August 2021 in a cohort of 17 million Medicare beneficiaries of which 5.7 million were fully vaccinated. We found that individuals fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccines in January 2021 had 2.5 times higher breakthrough infections and hospitalizations than those fully vaccinated in March 2021, consistent with waning of vaccine-induced immunity.

Although vaccination still lowers the risk of infection, similar viral loads in vaccinated and unvaccinated persons who are infected with the delta variant call into question the degree to which vaccination prevents transmission. METHODS: We used contact-testing data from England to perform a retrospective observational cohort study involving adult contacts of SARS-CoV-2-infected adult index patients. We used multivariable Poisson regression to investigate associations between transmission and the vaccination status of index patients and contacts and to determine how these associations varied with the B.1.1.7 (alpha) and delta variants and time since the second vaccination. RESULTS: Among 146,243 tested contacts of 108,498 index patients, 54,667 (37%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) tests. In index patients who became infected with the alpha variant, two vaccinations with either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (also known as AZD1222), as compared with no vaccination, were independently associated with reduced PCR positivity in contacts (adjusted rate ratio with BNT162b2, 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21 to 0.48; and with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.78). Vaccine-associated reductions in transmission of the delta variant were smaller than those with the alpha variant, and reductions in transmission of the delta variant after two BNT162b2 vaccinations were greater (adjusted rate ratio for the comparison with no vaccination, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.65) than after two ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinations (adjusted rate ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.82). Variation in cycle-threshold (Ct) values (indicative of viral load) in index patients explained 7 to 23% of vaccine-associated reductions in transmission of the two variants. The reductions in transmission of the delta variant declined over time after the second vaccination, reaching levels that were similar to those in unvaccinated persons by 12 weeks in index patients who had received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and attenuating substantially in those who had received BNT162b2. Protection in contacts also declined in the 3-month period after the second vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination was associated with a smaller reduction in transmission of the delta variant than of the alpha variant, and the effects of vaccination decreased over time. PCR Ct values at diagnosis of the index patient only partially explained decreased transmission.

This study aims to estimate the relative effectiveness of a 2nd booster dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in the population aged ≥ 80 years in Italy, during predominant circulation of the Omicron BA.2 and BA.5 subvariants. We linked routine data from the national vaccination registry and the COVID-19 surveillance system. On each day between 11 April and 6 August 2022, we matched 1:1, according to several demographic and clinical characteristics, individuals who received the 2nd booster vaccine dose with individuals who received the 1st booster vaccine dose at least 120 days earlier. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to compare the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 (hospitalisation or death) between the two groups, calculating the relative vaccine effectiveness (RVE) as (1 - risk ratio)X100. Based on the analysis of 831,555 matched pairs, we found that a 2nd booster dose of mRNA vaccine, 14-118 days post administration, was moderately effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to a 1st booster dose administered at least 120 days earlier [14.3 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 2.2-20.2]. RVE decreased from 28.5 % (95 % CI: 24.7-32.1) in the time-interval 14-28 days to 7.6 % (95 % CI: -14.1 to 18.3) in the time-interval 56-118 days.

PARTICIPANTS: 893 461 adults (≥18 years) admitted to one of 261 hospitals or to one of 272 emergency department or 119 urgent care centers for covid-like illness tested for SARS-CoV-2. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome was waning of vaccine effectiveness with BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine during the omicron and delta periods, and the period before delta was dominant using logistic regression conditioned on calendar week and geographic area while adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, local virus circulation, immunocompromised status, and likelihood of being vaccinated. RESULTS: 45 903 people admitted to hospital with covid-19 (cases) were compared with 213 103 people with covid-like illness who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (controls), and 103 287 people admitted to emergency department or urgent care with covid-19 (cases) were compared with 531 168 people with covid-like illness who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. In the omicron period, vaccine effectiveness against covid-19 requiring admission to hospital was 89% (95% confidence interval 88% to 90%) within two months after dose 3 but waned to 66% (63% to 68%) by four to five months. Vaccine effectiveness of three doses against emergency department or urgent care visits was 83% (82% to 84%) initially but waned to 46% (44% to 49%) by four to five months. Waning was evident in all subgroups, including young adults and individuals who were not immunocompromised; although waning was morein people who were immunocompromised.

Cases (SARS-CoV-2 test-positive adolescents) and controls (test-negative adolescents) were drawn from a sample of individuals in whom tests were collected within 10 days of symptom onset. We estimated the adjusted odds ratio and vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 for both countries and against severe COVID-19 (hospitalisation or death) for Brazil across fortnightly periods. FINDINGS: We analysed 503 776 tests from 2 948 538 adolescents in Brazil between Sept 2, 2021, and April 19, 2022, and 127 168 tests from 404 673 adolescents in Scotland between Aug 6, 2021, and April 19, 2022. Vaccine effectiveness peaked at 14-27 days after the second dose in both countries during both waves, and was significantly lower against symptomatic infection during the omicron-dominant period in Brazil (64·7% [95% CI 63·0-66·3]) and in Scotland (82·6% [80·6-84·5]), than it was in the delta-dominant period (80·7% [95% CI 77·8-83·3] in Brazil and 92·8% [85·7-96·4] in Scotland). Vaccine efficacy started to decline from 27 days after the second dose for both countries, reducing to 5·9% (95% CI 2·2-9·4) in Brazil and 50·6% (42·7-57·4) in Scotland at 98 days or more during the omicron-dominant period. In Brazil, protection against severe disease remained above 80% from 28 days after the second dose and was 82·7% (95% CI 68·8-90·4) at 98 days or more after receiving the second dose. INTERPRETATION: We found waning vaccine protection of BNT162b2 against symptomatic COVID-19 infection among adolescents in Brazil and Scotland from 27 days after the second dose. However, protection against severe COVID-19 outcomes remained high at 98 days or more after the second dose in the omicron-dominant period. Booster doses for adolescents need to be considered.

METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, we used data collected between 20 December 2020 and 17 March 2021 from the second largest healthcare provider in Israel to analyze the probability of an additional household infection occurring within 10 days after an index infection. In model 1, vaccine effectiveness was described for Fully Vaccinated individuals (7 or more days from second dose) vs either Unvaccinated individuals or those Recently Vaccinated Once (0-7 days from the first dose, presumably still unprotected). Secondary analyses included correction for differing testing rates. In model 2, we conducted a separate analysis of households comprised of only adults with the same vaccination status. RESULTS: A total of 173 569 households were included, of which 6351 had an index infection (mean [standard deviation] age, 58.9 [13.5] years); 50% were women. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness of Fully Vaccinated compared with Unvaccinated participants was 80.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 73.5-85.4) and 82.0% (95% CI, 75.6-86.8) compared with those Recently Vaccinated Once. CONCLUSIONS: The BNT162b2 vaccine is effective in high-risk real-life exposure scenarios, but the protection afforded in these settings is lower than that previously described.

DESIGN: Retrospective, test negative, case-control study, with a matched analysis and an unmatched multiple tests analysis. SETTING: Nationally centralised database of Maccabi Healthcare Services, an Israeli national health fund for 2.5 million people; from 10 January 2022 (seven days after the fourth dose was first given to eligible individuals) to 13 March 2022, an omicron dominant period in Israel. PARTICIPANTS: 97 499 Maccabi Healthcare Services members aged 60 years and older, who were eligible to receive a fourth vaccine dose and obtained at least one polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test during the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as a positive PCR test performed seven or more days after inoculation with the BNT162b2 vaccine; and breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in severe covid-19 disease, defined as hospital admission or death related to covid-19. RESULTS: 27 876 participants received the fourth BNT162b2 vaccine dose and 69 623 received three doses only. Of 106 participants who died during the follow-up period, 77 had had their third doses only and 23 had had their fourth doses during the first three weeks after inoculation. In the first three weeks, a fourth dose provided additional protection against both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease relative to three doses of the vaccine. However, relative vaccine effectiveness against infection quickly decreased over time, peaking during the third week at 65.1% (95% confidence interval 63.0% to 67.1%) and falling to 22.0% (4.9% to 36.1%) by the end of the 10 week follow-up period. Unlike relative effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection, the relative effectiveness of a fourth dose against severe covid-19 was maintained at a high level (>72%) throughout follow-up. However, severe disease was a relatively rare event, occurring in <1% of study participants who received four doses or three doses only. CONCLUSIONS: A fourth dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine appears to have provided additional protection against both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe covid-19 disease relative to three vaccine doses. However, relative effectiveness of the fourth dose against infection appears to wane sooner than that of the third dose.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: case-control",10.1136/bmj-2022-071113,Aged;BNT162 Vaccine;*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;*COVID-19 Vaccines;Case-Control Studies;Humans;Israel/epidemiology;Middle Aged;Retrospective Studies;SARS-CoV-2;Vaccination;Israel,35609888,PMC9127435

The UK mass vaccination program commenced on December 8, 2020, vaccinating groups of the population deemed to be most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infection. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the early vaccine administration coverage and outcome data across an integrated care system in North West London, leveraging a unique population-level care data set. Vaccine effectiveness of a single dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines were compared. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study identified 2,183,939 individuals eligible for COVID-19 vaccination between December 8, 2020, and February 24, 2021, within a primary, secondary, and community care integrated care data set. These data were used to assess vaccination hesitancy across ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic deprivation measures (Pearson product-moment correlations); investigate COVID-19 transmission related to vaccination hubs; and assess the early effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination (after a single dose) using time-to-event analyses with multivariable Cox regression analysis to investigate if vaccination independently predicted positive SARS-CoV-2 in those vaccinated compared to those unvaccinated. RESULTS: In this study, 5.88% (24,332/413,919) of individuals declined and did not receive a vaccination. Black or Black British individuals had the highest rate of declining a vaccine at 16.14% (4337/26,870). There was a strong negative association between socioeconomic deprivation and rate of declining vaccination (r=-0.94; P=.002) with 13.5% (1980/14,571) of individuals declining vaccination in the most deprived areas compared to 0.98% (869/9609) in the least. In the first 6 days after vaccination, 344 of 389,587 (0.09%) individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The rate increased to 0.13% (525/389,243) between days 7 and 13, before then gradually falling week on week. At 28 days post vaccination, there was a 74% (hazard ratio 0.26, 95% CI 0.19-0.35) and 78% (hazard ratio 0.22, 95% CI 0.18-0.27) reduction in risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 for individuals that received the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, respectively, when compared with unvaccinated individuals. A very low proportion of hospital admissions were seen in vaccinated individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (288/389,587, 0.07% of all patients vaccinated) providing evidence for vaccination effectiveness after a single dose. CONCLUSIONS: There was no definitive evidence to suggest COVID-19 was transmitted as a result of vaccination hubs during the vaccine administration rollout in North West London, and the risk of contracting COVID-19 or becoming hospitalized after vaccination has been demonstrated to be low in the vaccinated population. This study provides further evidence that a single dose of either the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine or the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is effective at reducing the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 up to 60 days across all age groups, ethnic groups, and risk categories in an urban UK population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.2196/30010,Anti-Vaccination Movement/psychology/*statistics & numerical data;COVID-19/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines/*standards/therapeutic use;Cohort Studies;Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data;Humans;Immunization Programs/*standards/statistics & numerical data;London;Retrospective Studies;Vaccination;Vaccines,34265740,PMC8451961

We performed a longitudinal analysis of multiple cohorts, using individual data, to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine against new and breakthrough cases. METHODS: We estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) for 27 consecutive cohorts, each comprised of individuals vaccinated on specific days. VE against new COVID-19 cases was evaluated for five SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes: infection, symptomatic disease, hospitalisation, severe/critical disease and death. For breakthrough cases, rate reduction was evaluated for hospitalisation, severe/critical disease and death. Outcomes were evaluated at predetermined time-periods after vaccination, the last one dedicated to individuals who became SARS-CoV-2-positive 22-28 days after the second dose. FINDINGS: The highest VE estimates against new cases in ≥16 year old individuals, for all outcomes, were reached at the 15-21 day period after the second dose, ranging between 97.7% (95% CI: 95.9-98.7%) for deaths and 98.6% (95% CI: 97.8-99.1%) for severe/critical disease.

Initially, in the Western world, COVID-19-related mortality was due to illness in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). To manage the COVID-19 crisis in LTCFs in Israel, the Ministry of Health established a task force named ""Senior Shield."" The task force executed a screening program of weekly polymerase chain reaction (PCR) SARS-CoV-2 tests for LTCF residents and caregivers, and at a later stage, the task force led the Ministry of Health vaccination program at LTCFs. This study aimed to estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 (Comirnaty) vaccine in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in LTCF residents. METHODS: We designed a nationwide cohort study utilizing data from the Senior Shield task force. Residents had received the vaccines starting December 2020. The study follow-up period was 5 months (ending May 2021). We defined four outcomes: (a) documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined by a positive PCR test, (b) COVID-19 death, defined by a positive PCR test followed by death, (c) all-cause mortality, defined as death regardless of the result of a PCR test, and (d) a composite endpoint which included documented SARS-CoV-2 infection or death, the earliest of both. We used Kaplan-Meier curves with a log-rank comparison and Cox regression with a time-dependent covariate model to estimate adjusted hazard ratios for vaccine effectiveness (VE). The index date was the date of the first vaccine dose. In unvaccinated residents, the index date was the first date of vaccination in their LTCF. RESULTS: A total of 43,596 residents with a mean age of 83 years living in 454 LTCFs were found eligible for this study. Ninety-one percent of the study population received the first vaccine dose (39,482) and 86% received the second vaccine dose (37,656). Estimated VE 28 days after the first vaccine dose (approximately 7 days after the second vaccine dose) was 81.2% for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 85.3% for COVID-related death, 63.7% for all-cause mortality, and 71.1% for the composite endpoint (SARS-CoV-2 infection or death). CONCLUSION: This study shows that the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine effectively prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related death, and all-cause mortality in LTCF residents. Further research is warranted on the effect of the third vaccine (booster) in this population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1159/000521899,"Aged, 80 and over;Humans;BNT162 Vaccine;Cohort Studies;*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines/therapeutic use;Long-Term Care;RNA, Messenger;SARS-CoV-2;Vaccine Efficacy;Vaccination",35134810,PMC9059015

Pregnant women vaccinated with a first dose from December 19, 2020, through February 28, 2021, were 1:1 matched to unvaccinated women by age, gestational age, residential area, population subgroup, parity, and influenza immunization status. Follow-up ended on April 11, 2021. EXPOSURES: Exposure was defined by receipt of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. To maintain comparability, nonexposed women who were subsequently vaccinated were censored 10 days after their exposure, along with their matched pair. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was polymerase chain reaction-validated SARS-CoV-2 infection at 28 days or more after the first vaccine dose. RESULTS: The cohort included 7530 vaccinated and 7530 matched unvaccinated women, 46% and 33% in the second and third trimester, respectively, with a mean age of 31.1 years (SD, 4.9 years). The median follow-up for the primary outcome was 37 days (interquartile range, 21-54 days; range, 0-70). There were 118 SARS-CoV-2 infections in the vaccinated group and 202 in the unvaccinated group. Among infected women, 88 of 105 (83.8%) were symptomatic in the vaccinated group vs 149 of 179 (83.2%) in the unvaccinated group (P ≥ .99). During 28 to 70 days of follow-up, there were 10 infections in the vaccinated group and 46 in the unvaccinated group. The hazards of infection were 0.33% vs 1.64% in the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, respectively, representing an absolute difference of 1.31% (95% CI, 0.89%-1.74%), with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.22 (95% CI, 0.11-0.43). Vaccine-related adverse events were reported by 68 patients; none was severe. The most commonly reported symptoms were headache (n = 10, 0.1%), general weakness (n = 8, 0.1%), nonspecified pain (n = 6, <0.1%), and stomachache (n = 5, <0.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this retrospective cohort study of pregnant women, BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination compared with no vaccination was associated with a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interpretation of study findings is limited by the observational design.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1001/jama.2021.11035,"Adult;BNT162 Vaccine;COVID-19/*epidemiology/immunology/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/immunology;Case-Control Studies;Confidence Intervals;Female;Gestational Age;Humans;Incidence;Israel/epidemiology;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*epidemiology/immunology/prevention & control;*Pregnant Women;Regression Analysis;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Time Factors;Vaccination/statistics & numerical data;Vaccination",34251417,PMC8276131

OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of COVID-19 vaccination with breakthrough infections and complications in patients with cancer compared to noncancer controls. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective population-based cohort study using linked administrative databases in Ontario, Canada, in residents 18 years and older who received COVID-19 vaccination. Three matched groups were identified (based on age, sex, type of vaccine, date of vaccine): 1:4 match for patients with hematologic and solid cancer to noncancer controls (hematologic and solid cancers separately analyzed), 1:1 match between patients with hematologic and patients with solid cancer. EXPOSURES: Cancer diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes occurring 14 days after receipt of second COVID-19 vaccination dose: primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection; secondary outcomes were emergency department visit, hospitalization, and death within 4 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection (end of follow-up March 31, 2022). Multivariable cumulative incidence function models were used to obtain adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: A total of 289 400 vaccinated patients with cancer (39 880 hematologic; 249 520 solid) with 1 157 600 matched noncancer controls were identified; the cohort was 65.4% female, and mean (SD) age was 66 (14.0) years. SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection was higher in patients with hematologic cancer (aHR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.20-1.46; P < .001) but not in patients with solid cancer (aHR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.96-1.05; P = .87). COVID-19 severe outcomes (composite of hospitalization and death) were significantly higher in patients with cancer compared to patients without cancer (aHR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.42-1.63; P < .001). Risk of severe outcomes was higher among patients with hematologic cancer (aHR, 2.51; 95% CI, 2.21-2.85; P < .001) than patients with solid cancer (aHR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.24-1.64; P < .001). Patients receiving active treatment had a further heightened risk for COVID-19 severe outcomes, particularly those who received anti-CD20 therapy. Third vaccination dose was associated with lower infection and COVID-19 complications, except for patients receiving anti-CD20 therapy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this large population-based cohort study, patients with cancer had greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and worse outcomes than patients without cancer, and the risk was highest for patients with hematologic cancer and any patients with cancer receiving active treatment. Triple vaccination was associated with lower risk of poor outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1001/jamaoncol.2022.6815,Vaccination;Vaccines,36580318,

The aim of this Danish nationwide population-based cohort study was therefore to estimate the VE against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization and death following the first dose of the ChAdOx1 vaccine and the combination of the ChAdOx1/mRNA vaccines. METHODS AND FINDINGS: All individuals alive in or immigrating to Denmark from 9 February 2021 to 23 June 2021 were identified in the Danish Civil Registration System. Information on exposure, outcomes, and covariates was obtained from Danish national registries. Poisson and Cox regression models were used to calculate crude and adjusted VE, respectively, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization or death comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals. The VE estimates were adjusted for calendar time as underlying time and for sex, age, comorbidity, country of origin, and hospital admission. The analyses included 5,542,079 individuals (97.6% of the total Danish population). A total of 144,360 individuals were vaccinated with the ChAdOx1 vaccine as the first dose, and of these, 136,551 individuals received an mRNA vaccine as the second dose. A total of 1,691,464 person-years and 83,034 SARS-CoV-2 infections were included. The individuals vaccinated with the first dose of the ChAdOx1 vaccine dose had a median age of 45 years. The study population was characterized by an equal distribution of males and females; 6.7% and 9.2% originated from high-income and other countries, respectively. The VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection when combining the ChAdOx1 and an mRNA vaccine was 88% (95% CI: 83; 92) 14 days after the second dose and onwards. There were no COVID-19-related hospitalizations or deaths among the individuals vaccinated with the combined vaccine schedule during the study period. Study limitations including unmeasured confounders such as risk behavior and increasing overall vaccine coverage in the general population creating herd immunity are important to take into consideration when interpreting the results. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed a large reduction in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection when combining the ChAdOx1 and an mRNA vaccine, compared with unvaccinated individuals.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1371/journal.pmed.1003874,Adult;BNT162 Vaccine/*administration & dosage;COVID-19/*immunology/*prevention & control;ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/*administration & dosage;Comorbidity;Denmark;Female;Hospitalization;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Risk;*SARS-CoV-2;Treatment Outcome;Vaccination;Vaccine Efficacy;Cohort Studies;Vaccines,34919548,PMC8726493

METHODS: In this nationwide case-control study, cases were SARS-CoV-2 infected adults recruited between 23 May and 13 August 2021. Controls were non-infected adults from a national representative panel matched to cases by age, sex, region, population density and calendar week. Participants completed an online questionnaire and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and recent activity-related exposures, past history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and COVID-19 vaccination. FINDINGS: We did not find any differences in the settings and activities associated with Delta versus non-Delta infections and grouped them for subsequent analyses. In multivariable analysis involving 12634 cases (8644 Delta and 3990 non-Delta) and 5560 controls, we found individuals under 40 years and attending bars (aOR:1.9; 95%CI:1.6-2.2) or parties (aOR:3.4; 95%CI:2.8-4.2) to be at increased risk of infection.

We found strong protection against symptomatic Delta infection for those with prior infection whether it was recent (2-6 months) (95%; 95%CI:90-97) or associated with one dose (85%; 95%CI:78-90) or two doses of mRNA vaccine (96%; 95%CI:87-99). For those without past infection, protection was lower with two doses of mRNA vaccine (67%; 95%CI:63-71).

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between COVID-19 vaccination status and mortality among critically ill patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation owing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cohort study was performed between June 7, 2021, and February 1, 2022, among 265 consecutive adult patients with COVID-19 in academic intensive care units who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation owing to ARDS. EXPOSURES: Patients in the full vaccination group had completed the primary COVID-19 vaccination series more than 14 days but less than 5 months prior to intubation. This time threshold was chosen because guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend a booster dose beyond that time. The remaining patients (ie, those who were unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, or fully vaccinated <14 days or >5 months before intubation) comprised the control group. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time from intubation to all-cause intensive care unit mortality. A Cox proportional hazards regression model including vaccination status, age, comorbid conditions, and baseline Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score on the day of intubation was used. RESULTS: A total of 265 intubated patients (170 men [64.2%]; median age, 66.0 years [IQR, 58.0-76.0 years]; 26 [9.8%] in the full vaccination group) were included in the study. A total of 20 patients (76.9%) in the full vaccination group received the BNT162b2 vaccine, and the remaining 6 (23.1%) received the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Patients in the full vaccination group were older (median age, 72.5 years [IQR, 62.8-80.0 years] vs 66.0 years [IQR, 57.0-75.0 years]) and more likely to have comorbid conditions (24 of 26 [92.3%] vs 160 of 239 [66.9%]), including malignant neoplasm (6 of 26 [23.1%] vs 18 of 239 [7.5%]), than those in the control group. Full vaccination status was significantly associated with lower mortality compared with controls (16 of 26 patients [61.5%] died in the full vaccination group vs 163 of 239 [68.2%] in the control group; hazard ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.32-0.94]; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, full vaccination status was associated with lower mortality compared with controls, which suggests that vaccination might be beneficial even among patients who were intubated owing to COVID-19-related ARDS.

The objective is to assess the effectiveness of a single dose of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (BNT162b2) after twelve days of its administration in healthcare personnel (HCP) of a Health Department. METHODS: A case-control study was made. HCP with suspected COVID-19 and HCP close contacts of COVID-19 cases were included between January 27 and February 7, 2021. They were PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2; those with positive PCR were considered cases and those with negative PCR were considered controls. The crude (VE) and adjusted (VEa) vaccine effectiveness to prevent COVID-19 cases and their 95% confidence interval were calculated using the formula VE = (1-Odds ratio) x 100. RESULTS: 268 HCP were included, of which 70 (26.1%) were considered cases and 198 (73.9%) controls. The frequency of vaccine exposure in cases was 55.7% vs. 69.7% in controls (p=0.035). The VEa of the first vaccine dose was 52.6% (95%CI: 1.1-77.3). The VEa in the subgroup of HCP studied for suspected disease was 74.6% (CI95%: 38.4-89.5). CONCLUSIONS: One dose of BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 offers early protection after twelve days of administration. These data could be considered to adapt strategies and consider postponing the second dose in situations of limited vaccine supply in order to achieve the maximum number of people covered with a first dose.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: case-control",,Adult;BNT162 Vaccine;COVID-19/diagnosis/*prevention & control;COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing;*COVID-19 Vaccines;Case-Control Studies;Female;*Health Personnel;Humans;Logistic Models;Male;Middle Aged;Spain;Treatment Outcome;Vaccination;Vaccines,33913444,

DESIGN: Test negative design. SETTING: Long term care facilities in Ontario, Canada, 30 December 2021 to 27 April 2022. PARTICIPANTS: After exclusions, 61 344 residents aged 60 years or older across 626 long term care facilities in Ontario, Canada who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Laboratory confirmed omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection (any and symptomatic) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and hospital admission or death. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate marginal effectiveness (four versus three doses) and vaccine effectiveness (two, three, or four doses versus no doses) while adjusting for personal characteristics, comorbidities, week of test, and previous positive SARS-CoV-2 test result more than 90 days previously. RESULTS: 13 654 residents who tested positive for omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection and 205 862 test negative controls were included. The marginal effectiveness of a fourth dose (95% of vaccine recipients received mRNA-1273 as the fourth dose) seven days or more after vaccination versus a third dose received 84 or more days previously was 19% (95% confidence interval 12% to 26%) against infection, 31% (20% to 41%) against symptomatic infection, and 40% (24% to 52%) against severe outcomes.

Transplacental transfer of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) after maternal Covid-19 vaccination may confer protection against Covid-19 in infants. METHODS: We used a case-control test-negative design to assess the effectiveness of maternal vaccination during pregnancy against hospitalization for Covid-19 among infants younger than 6 months of age. Between July 1, 2021, and March 8, 2022, we enrolled infants hospitalized for Covid-19 (case infants) and infants hospitalized without Covid-19 (control infants) at 30 hospitals in 22 states. We estimated vaccine effectiveness by comparing the odds of full maternal vaccination (two doses of mRNA vaccine) among case infants and control infants during circulation of the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant (July 1, 2021, to December 18, 2021) and the B.1.1.259 (omicron) variant (December 19, 2021, to March 8, 2022). RESULTS: A total of 537 case infants (181 of whom had been admitted to a hospital during the delta period and 356 during the omicron period; median age, 2 months) and 512 control infants were enrolled and included in the analyses; 16% of the case infants and 29% of the control infants had been born to mothers who had been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 during pregnancy. Among the case infants, 113 (21%) received intensive care (64 [12%] received mechanical ventilation or vasoactive infusions). Two case infants died from Covid-19; neither infant's mother had been vaccinated during pregnancy. The effectiveness of maternal vaccination against hospitalization for Covid-19 among infants was 52% (95% confidence interval [CI], 33 to 65) overall, 80% (95% CI, 60 to 90) during the delta period, and 38% (95% CI, 8 to 58) during the omicron period. Effectiveness was 69% (95% CI, 50 to 80) when maternal vaccination occurred after 20 weeks of pregnancy and 38% (95% CI, 3 to 60) during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal vaccination with two doses of mRNA vaccine was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization for Covid-19, including for critical illness, among infants younger than 6 months of age.

We aimed to determine the factors associated with vaccine coverage for both vaccines and documented the vaccine effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in a cohort of health-care workers undergoing regular asymptomatic testing. METHODS: The SIREN study is a prospective cohort study among staff (aged ≥18 years) working in publicly-funded hospitals in the UK. Participants were assigned into either the positive cohort (antibody positive or history of infection [indicated by previous positivity of antibody or PCR tests]) or the negative cohort (antibody negative with no previous positive test) at the beginning of the follow-up period. Baseline risk factors were collected at enrolment, symptom status was collected every 2 weeks, and vaccination status was collected through linkage to the National Immunisations Management System and questionnaires. Participants had fortnightly asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and monthly antibody testing, and all tests (including symptomatic testing) outside SIREN were captured. Data cutoff for this analysis was Feb 5, 2021. The follow-up period was Dec 7, 2020, to Feb 5, 2021. The primary outcomes were vaccinated participants (binary ever vacinated variable; indicated by at least one vaccine dose recorded by at least one of the two vaccination data sources) for the vaccine coverage analysis and SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a PCR test for the vaccine effectiveness analysis. We did a mixed-effect logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with vaccine coverage. We used a piecewise exponential hazard mixed-effects model (shared frailty-type model) using a Poisson distribution to calculate hazard ratios to compare time-to-infection in unvaccinated and vaccinated participants and estimate the impact of the BNT162b2 vaccine on all PCR-positive infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic). This study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN11041050, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: 23 324 participants from 104 sites (all in England) met the inclusion criteria for this analysis and were enrolled. Included participants had a median age of 46·1 years (IQR 36·0-54·1) and 19 692 (84%) were female; 8203 (35%) were assigned to the positive cohort at the start of the analysis period, and 15 121 (65%) assigned to the negative cohort. Total follow-up time was 2 calendar months and 1 106 905 person-days (396 318 vaccinated and 710 587 unvaccinated). Vaccine coverage was 89% on Feb 5, 2021, 94% of whom had BNT162b2 vaccine. Significantly lower coverage was associated with previous infection, gender, age, ethnicity, job role, and Index of Multiple Deprivation score. During follow-up, there were 977 new infections in the unvaccinated cohort, an incidence density of 14 infections per 10 000 person-days; the vaccinated cohort had 71 new infections 21 days or more after their first dose (incidence density of eight infections per 10 000 person-days) and nine infections 7 days after the second dose (incidence density four infections per 10 000 person-days). In the unvaccinated cohort, 543 (56%) participants had typical COVID-19 symptoms and 140 (14%) were asymptomatic on or 14 days before their PCR positive test date, compared with 29 (36%) with typical COVID-19 symptoms and 15 (19%) asymptomatic in the vaccinated cohort. A single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine showed vaccine effectiveness of 70% (95% CI 55-85) 21 days after first dose and 85% (74-96) 7 days after two doses in the study population. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that the BNT162b2 vaccine can prevent both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection in working-age adults. This cohort was vaccinated when the dominant variant in circulation was B1.1.7 and shows effectiveness against this variant.

METHODS: We investigated the duration and effectiveness of immunity in a prospective cohort of asymptomatic health care workers in the United Kingdom who underwent routine polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing. Vaccine effectiveness (≤10 months after the first dose of vaccine) and infection-acquired immunity were assessed by comparing the time to PCR-confirmed infection in vaccinated persons with that in unvaccinated persons, stratified according to previous infection status. We used a Cox regression model with adjustment for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status, vaccine type and dosing interval, demographic characteristics, and workplace exposure to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Of 35,768 participants, 27% (9488) had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccine coverage was high: 95% of the participants had received two doses (78% had received BNT162b2 vaccine [Pfizer-BioNTech] with a long interval between doses, 9% BNT162b2 vaccine with a short interval between doses, and 8% ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine [AstraZeneca]). Between December 7, 2020, and September 21, 2021, a total of 2747 primary infections and 210 reinfections were observed. Among previously uninfected participants who received long-interval BNT162b2 vaccine, adjusted vaccine effectiveness decreased from 85% (95% confidence interval [CI], 72 to 92) 14 to 73 days after the second dose to 51% (95% CI, 22 to 69) at a median of 201 days (interquartile range, 197 to 205) after the second dose; this effectiveness did not differ significantly between the long-interval and short-interval BNT162b2 vaccine recipients. At 14 to 73 days after the second dose, adjusted vaccine effectiveness among ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine recipients was 58% (95% CI, 23 to 77) - considerably lower than that among BNT162b2 vaccine recipients. Infection-acquired immunity waned after 1 year in unvaccinated participants but remained consistently higher than 90% in those who were subsequently vaccinated, even in persons infected more than 18 months previously. CONCLUSIONS: Two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine were associated with high short-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection; this protection waned considerably after 6 months. Infection-acquired immunity boosted with vaccination remained high more than 1 year after infection.

However, it is unknown how long protective immunity lasts. Current guidelines recommend vaccination of recovered patients even though data regarding vaccine effectiveness in such cases are still limited. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed electronic medical records from a large health care organization in Israel to assess reinfection rates in patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection before any vaccination against Covid-19. We compared reinfection rates among patients who had subsequently received the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) and those who had not been vaccinated between March 1 and November 26, 2021. We used a Cox proportional-hazards regression model with time-dependent covariates to estimate the association between vaccination and reinfection after adjustment for demographic factors and coexisting illnesses. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as 1 minus the hazard ratio. In a secondary analysis, we evaluated the vaccine effectiveness of one dose as compared with two doses. RESULTS: A total of 149,032 patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection met the eligibility criteria. Of these patients, 83,356 (56%) received subsequent vaccination during the 270-day study period. Reinfection occurred in 354 of the vaccinated patients (2.46 cases per 100,000 persons per day) and in 2168 of 65,676 unvaccinated patients (10.21 cases per 100,000 persons per day). Vaccine effectiveness was estimated at 82% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80 to 84) among patients who were 16 to 64 years of age and 60% (95% CI, 36 to 76) among those 65 years of age or older.

We estimated natural and vaccine immunity and severity of BA.5 relative to BA.2 in Denmark, a country with high mRNA-vaccination coverage and free-of-charge RT-PCR testing. METHODS: This nation-wide population-based study in Denmark included residents aged 18 years or older who had taken an RT-PCR test between 10 April and 30 June, 2022 (ie, the outcome period), and who the national COVID-19 surveillance system identified as having information since February 2020 on RT-PCR tests, whole-genome sequencing, vaccinations, and hospitalisation with a positive RT-PCR test and COVID-19 as the main diagnosis. First, we used a case-control design, in which cases were people infected with BA.5 or BA.2 during the outcome period and controls were people who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection during the outcome period. We calculated the protection provided by a previous PCR-confirmed omicron infection against BA.5 and BA.2 infection and hospitalisation among triple-vaccinated individuals. Second, we compared vaccination status in people infected with BA.5 versus BA.2 and estimated relative vaccine protection against each subvariant. Third, we compared rates of hospitalisation for COVID-19 among people infected with BA.5 versus BA.2. We estimated effects using logistic regression with adjustment for sex, age, region, PCR-test date, comorbidity and, as appropriate, vaccination and previous infection status. FINDINGS: A total of 210 (2·4%) of 8678 of BA.5 cases, 192 (0·7%) of 29 292 of BA.2 cases, and 33 972 (19·0%) of 178 669 PCR-negative controls previously had an omicron infection, which was estimated in the adjusted analyses to offer 92·7% (95% CI 91·6-93·7) protection against BA.5 infection and 97·1% (96·6-97·5) protection against BA.2 infection. We found similarly high amounts of protection against hospitalisation owing to infection with BA.5 (96·4% [95% CI 74·2-99·5]) and BA.2 (91·2% [76·3-96·7]). Vaccine coverage (three mRNA doses vs none) was 9307 (94·2%) of 9878 among BA.5 cases and 30 581 (94·8%) of 32 272 among BA.2 cases, although in the adjusted analysis, there was a trend towards slightly higher vaccination coverage among BA.5 cases than BA.2 cases (OR 1·18 [95% CI 0·99-1·42]; p=0·064), possibly suggesting marginally poorer vaccine protection against BA.5. The rate of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 was higher among the BA.5 cases (210 [1·9%] of 11 314) than among the BA.2 cases (514 [1·4%] of 36 805), with an OR of 1·34 (95% CI 1·14-1·57) and an adjusted OR of 1·69 (95% CI 1·22-2·33), despite low and stable COVID-19 hospitalisation numbers during the study period. INTERPRETATION: The study provides evidence that a previous omicron infection in triple-vaccinated individuals provides high amounts of protection against BA.5 and BA.2 infections. However, protection estimates greater than 90% might be too high if individuals with a previous infection were more likely than those without one to come forward for a test for reasons other than suspicion of COVID-19. Our analysis also showed that vaccine protection against BA.5 infection was similar to, or slightly weaker than, protection against BA.2 infection. Finally, there was evidence that BA.5 infections were associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation compared with BA.2 infections.

We aimed to estimate the effectiveness of the overall COVID-19 vaccination programme implemented in the Apulia region of Italy at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections, COVID-19-related hospital admissions and deaths during alpha and delta variant dominant periods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic health records of persons 16 years and older resident in the Apulia region, assessing the effectiveness of the combined use of BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1-S and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines against confirmed COVID-19 infections, hospitalisations and deaths, for fully and partially vaccinated persons as well as by time since vaccination and variants. Cox regression models yielding hazard ratios were used to calculate the overall vaccination programme effectiveness. From 1 January to 1 December 2021, we included 3,530,967 eligible persons in the cohort, of whom 2,770,299 were fully vaccinated and 158,313 were COVID-19 positive at the end of the study period. The effectiveness of the programme over the entire study period for fully vaccinated persons against COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation and death were 87.69% (CI95% 87.73-88.18), 94.08% (93.58-94.54) and 95.95% (CI95% 95.26-96.54), respectively. The effectiveness against COVID-19 infection of fully vaccinated subjects during the alpha and delta period was respectively 88.20% (CI95% 87.60-99.78) and 59.31% (CI95% 57.91-60.67), against hospitalisation 93.89% (CI95% 92.67-94.90) and 88.32% (CI95% 86.50-89.90) and against death 93.83% (CI95% 91.65-95.45) and 85.91 (CI95% 79.98-90.09). The waning effects of the programme regarding COVID-19 infection during the delta period were stronger than for alpha, with 75.85% (CI95% 74.38-77.24) effectiveness after 1-2 months and 8.35% (CI95% 3.45-13.01) after 5-6 months after full vaccination.

Our study suggests that the COVID-19 vaccination program in Apulia was strongly protective against COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation, and death due to alpha as well as delta variants, although its effectiveness is reduced over time.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1038/s41598-022-23235-4,Humans;*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines/therapeutic use;Program Evaluation;Retrospective Studies;Ad26COVS1;BNT162 Vaccine;SARS-CoV-2;Vaccination;Hospitalization;Cohort Studies;*Cross Infection;Italy;Vaccines,36329239,PMC9632568

METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was applied to Taiwan community during the unprecedent large-scale outbreaks of Omicron BA.2 between April and August, 2022. Primary vaccination since March, 2021 and booster vaccination since January, 2022 were offered on population level. Oral Anti-viral therapy was also offered as of mid-May 2022. The population-based effectiveness of vaccination in reducing the risk of moderate and severe cases of and death from Omicron BA.2 with the consideration of NPI and oral anti-viral therapy were assessed by using Bayesian hierarchical models. RESULTS: The risks of three clinical outcomes associated with Omicron VOC infection were lowest for booster vaccination, followed by primary vaccination, and highest for incomplete vaccination with the consistent trends of being at increased risk for three outcomes from the young people aged 12 years or below until the elderly people aged 75 years or older with 7 age groups. Before the period using oral anti-viral therapy, complete primary vaccination with the duration more than 9 months before outbreaks conferred the statistically significant 47 % (23-64 %) reduction of death, 48 % (30-61 %) of severe disease, and 46 % (95 % CI: 37-54 %) of moderate disease after adjusting for 10-20 % independent effect of NPI. The benefits of booster vaccination within three months were further enhanced to 76 % (95 % CI: 67-86 %), 74 % (95 % CI: 67-80 %), and 61 % (95 % CI: 56-65 %) for three corresponding outcomes. The additional effectiveness of oral anti-viral therapy in reducing moderate disease was 13 % for the booster group and 5.8 % for primary vaccination.

Care home residents and staff, frontline health-care workers, and adults aged 80 years and older were vaccinated first. However, few data exist regarding the effectiveness of these vaccines in older people with many comorbidities. In this post-implementation evaluation of two COVID-19 vaccines, we aimed to determine the effectiveness of one dose in reducing COVID-19-related admissions to hospital in people of advanced age. METHODS: This prospective test-negative case-control study included adults aged at least 80 years who were admitted to hospital in two NHS trusts in Bristol, UK with signs and symptoms of respiratory disease. Patients who developed symptoms before receiving their vaccine or those who received their vaccine after admission to hospital were excluded, as were those with symptoms that started more than 10 days before hospital admission. We did logistic regression analysis, controlling for time (week), sex, index of multiple deprivations, and care residency status, and sensitivity analyses matched for time and sex using a conditional logistic model adjusting for index of multiple deprivations and care residency status.

To ensure adequate vaccination coverage, Thailand has proactively adopted heterologous vaccination schedules. While randomised controlled trials have assessed homologous schedules in detail, limited data has been reported for heterologous vaccine effectiveness (VE). METHODS: Utilising a unique active surveillance network established in Chiang Mai, Northern Thailand, we conducted a test-negative case control study to assess the VE of heterologous third and fourth dose schedules against SARS-CoV-2 infection among suspect-cases during Oct 1-Dec 31, 2021 (delta-predominant) and Feb 1-Apr 10, 2022 (omicron-predominant) periods. FINDINGS: After a third dose, effectiveness against delta infection was high (adjusted VE 97%, 95% CI 94-99%) in comparison to moderate protection against omicron (adjusted VE 31%, 95% CI 26-36%). Good protection was observed after a fourth dose (adjusted VE 75%, 95% CI 71-80%). VE was consistent across age groups for both delta and omicron infection. The VE of third or fourth doses against omicron infection were equivalent for the three main vaccines used for boosting in Thailand, suggesting coverage, rather than vaccine type is a much stronger predictor of protection. INTERPRETATION: Appropriately timed booster doses have a high probability of preventing COVID-19 infection with both delta and omicron variants. Our evidence supports the need for ongoing national efforts to increase population coverage of booster doses.

OBJECTIVE: To determine mRNA booster vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and death in the Omicron era by booster type, primary vaccine type, time since primary vaccination, age, and comorbidity burden. DESIGN: Retrospective matched cohort study designed to emulate a target trial of booster vaccination versus no booster, conducted from 1 December 2021 to 31 March 2022. SETTING: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs health care system. PARTICIPANTS: Persons who had received 2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses at least 5 months earlier. INTERVENTION: Booster monovalent mRNA vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech's BNT162b2 or Moderna's mRNA-1273) versus no booster. MEASUREMENTS: Booster VE. RESULTS: Each group included 490 838 well-matched persons, who were predominantly male (88%), had a mean age of 63.0 years (SD, 14.0), and were followed for up to 121 days (mean, 79.8 days). Booster VE more than 10 days after a booster dose was 42.3% (95% CI, 40.6% to 43.9%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 53.3% (CI, 48.1% to 58.0%) against SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization, and 79.1% (CI, 71.2% to 84.9%) against SARS-CoV-2-related death. Booster VE was similar for different booster types (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273), age groups, and primary vaccination regimens but was significantly higher with longer time since primary vaccination and higher comorbidity burden. LIMITATION: Predominantly male population. CONCLUSION: Booster mRNA vaccination was highly effective in preventing death and moderately effective in preventing infection and hospitalization for up to 4 months after administration in the Omicron era. Increased uptake of booster vaccination, which is currently suboptimal, should be pursued to limit the morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in persons with high comorbidity burden.

A countrywide mass vaccination campaign with the use of an inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine (CoronaVac) was conducted in Chile starting on February 2, 2021. METHODS: We used a prospective national cohort, including participants 16 years of age or older who were affiliated with the public national health care system, to assess the effectiveness of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine with regard to preventing Covid-19 and related hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and death. We estimated hazard ratios using the extension of the Cox proportional-hazards model, accounting for time-varying vaccination status. We estimated the change in the hazard ratio associated with partial immunization (≥14 days after receipt of the first dose and before receipt of the second dose) and full immunization (≥14 days after receipt of the second dose).

Individuals administered vaccines from Feb 2, 2021, to the prespecified study end date of Nov 10, 2021, were evaluated; we excluded individuals with a probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (RT-PCR or antigen test) on or before Feb 2, 2021, and individuals who had received at least one dose of any COVID-19 vaccine before Feb 2, 2021. We estimated the vaccine effectiveness of booster doses against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 (symptomatic COVID-19) cases and COVID-19 outcomes (hospitalisation, admission to the intensive care unit [ICU], and death We used inverse probability-weighted and stratified survival regression models to estimate hazard ratios, accounting for time-varying vaccination status and adjusting for relevant demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical confounders. We estimated the change in hazard from unvaccinated status to vaccinated status associated with the primary immunisation series and a booster vaccine. FINDINGS: 11 174 257 individuals were eligible for this study, among whom 4 127 546 completed a primary immunisation schedule (two doses) with CoronaVac and received a booster dose during the study period. 1 921 340 (46·5%) participants received an AZD1222 booster, 2 019 260 (48·9%) received a BNT162b2 booster, and 186 946 (4·5%) received a homologous booster with CoronaVac. We calculated an adjusted vaccine effectiveness (weighted stratified Cox model) in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 of 78·8% (95% CI 76·8-80·6) for a three-dose schedule with CoronaVac, 96·5% (96·2-96·7) for a BNT162b2 booster, and 93·2% (92·9-93·6) for an AZD1222 booster. The adjusted vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-related hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death was 86·3% (83·7-88·5), 92·2% (88·7-94·6), and 86·7% (80·5-91·0) for a homologous CoronaVac booster, 96·1% (95·3-96·9), 96·2% (94·6-97·3), and 96·8% (93·9-98·3) for a BNT162b2 booster, and 97·7% (97·3-98·0), 98·9% (98·5-99·2), and 98·1% (97·3-98·6) for an AZD1222 booster.

Cirrhosis is associated with vaccine hyporesponsiveness, but whether there is decreased immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection in unvaccinated patients with cirrhosis is unknown.The objective of our study was to compare infection-induced and vaccine-induced immunity against COVID-19 among patients with cirrhosis. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study among US Veterans with cirrhosis between November 27, 2020, and November 16, 2021, comparing a vaccine-induced immunity group, defined as participants without a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection but fully vaccinated with two doses of an mRNA vaccine, and infection-associated immunity group, defined as unvaccinated participants who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Both groups were propensity score matched for observed characteristics, including location, and the date of the immunity acquiring event, to control for the community prevalence of COVID-19 variants. The outcome was a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR more than 60 days after previous infection in the infection-induced, or after full vaccination in the vaccine-induced immunity group.

Vaccine-induced immunity was associated with a reduced odds of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.20, p < 0.0001). On multivariable logistic regression, vaccine-induced immunity was associated with reduced odds of developing symptomatic (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.36; 95% CI, 0.33-0.41, p < 0.0001), moderate/severe/critical (aOR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.22-0.31, p < 0.0001), and severe or critical COVID-19 (aOR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.16-0.26, p < 0.001), compared with infection-induced immunity. CONCLUSIONS: In participants with cirrhosis, vaccine-induced immunity is associated with reduced risk of developing COVID-19, compared with infection-induced immunity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1002/hep.32619,Humans;*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;Retrospective Studies;SARS-CoV-2;Liver Cirrhosis;*Vaccines;Vaccination;Vaccines,35712794,

We investigated the association between time since two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in Scotland (where delta was dominant), with comparative analyses in Brazil (where delta was uncommon). METHODS: In this retrospective, population-based cohort study in Brazil and Scotland, we linked national databases from the EAVE II study in Scotland; and the COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign, Acute Respiratory Infection Suspected Cases, and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection/Illness datasets in Brazil) for vaccination, laboratory testing, clinical, and mortality data. We defined cohorts of adults (aged ≥18 years) who received two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and compared rates of severe COVID-19 outcomes (ie, COVID-19 hospital admission or death) across fortnightly periods, relative to 2-3 weeks after the second dose. Entry to the Scotland cohort started from May 19, 2021, and entry to the Brazil cohort started from Jan 18, 2021. Follow-up in both cohorts was until Oct 25, 2021. Poisson regression was used to estimate rate ratios (RRs) and vaccine effectiveness, with 95% CIs. FINDINGS: 1 972 454 adults received two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in Scotland and 42 558 839 in Brazil, with longer follow-up in Scotland because two-dose vaccination began earlier in Scotland than in Brazil. In Scotland, RRs for severe COVID-19 increased to 2·01 (95% CI 1·54-2·62) at 10-11 weeks, 3·01 (2·26-3·99) at 14-15 weeks, and 5·43 (4·00-7·38) at 18-19 weeks after the second dose. The pattern of results was similar in Brazil, with RRs of 2·29 (2·01-2·61) at 10-11 weeks, 3·10 (2·63-3·64) at 14-15 weeks, and 4·71 (3·83-5·78) at 18-19 weeks after the second dose. In Scotland, vaccine effectiveness decreased from 83·7% (95% CI 79·7-87·0) at 2-3 weeks, to 75·9% (72·9-78·6) at 14-15 weeks, and 63·7% (59·6-67·4) at 18-19 weeks after the second dose. In Brazil, vaccine effectiveness decreased from 86·4% (85·4-87·3) at 2-3 weeks, to 59·7% (54·6-64·2) at 14-15 weeks, and 42·2% (32·4-50·6) at 18-19 weeks. INTERPRETATION: We found waning vaccine protection of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 against COVID-19 hospital admissions and deaths in both Scotland and Brazil, this becoming evident within three months of the second vaccine dose. Consideration needs to be given to providing booster vaccine doses for people who have received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.

By October 2021, the AY.4.2 variant accounted for approximately 10-11% of cases in the UK. AY.4.2 was designated as a variant under investigation by the UK Health and Security Agency on 20 October 2021. This study aimed to investigate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) infection and COVID-19 hospitalisation/death for the AY.4.2 variant. METHODS: We used the Scotland-wide Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance (EAVE-II) platform to estimate the VE of the ChAdOx1, BNT162b2, and mRNA-1273 vaccines against symptomatic infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes in adults. The study was conducted from June 8 to October 25, 2021. We used a test-negative design (TND) to estimate VE against reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection while adjusting for sex, socioeconomic status, number of coexisting conditions, and splines in time and age. We also performed a cohort study using a Cox proportional hazards model to estimate VE against a composite outcome of COVID-19 hospital admission or death, with the same adjustments. RESULTS: We found an overall VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection due to AY.4.2 of 73% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 62-81) for >14 days post-second vaccine dose. Good protection against AY.4.2 symptomatic infection was observed for BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, and mRNA-1273. In unvaccinated individuals, the hazard ratio (HR) for COVID-19 hospital admission or death from AY.4.2 among community detected cases was 1.77 (95% CI = 1.02-3.07) relative to unvaccinated individuals who were infected with Delta, after adjusting for multiple potential confounders. VE against AY.4.2 COVID-19 admissions or deaths was 87% (95% CI = 74-93) >28 days post-second vaccination relative to unvaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: We found that AY.4.2 was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalisations or deaths in unvaccinated individuals compared with Delta and that vaccination provided substantial protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 and severe COVID-19 outcomes following Delta AY.4.2 infection. High levels of vaccine uptake and protection offered by existing vaccines, as well as the rapid emergence of the Omicron variant may have contributed to the AY.4.2 variant never progressing to a variant of concern.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.7189/jogh.12.05025,Adult;BNT162 Vaccine;*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;*COVID-19 Vaccines;Cohort Studies;Humans;SARS-CoV-2;Scotland/epidemiology;Vaccine Efficacy;Vaccination,35802764,PMC9269984

OBJECTIVE: To estimate BNT162b2 VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection among children aged 5 to 11 years during Delta and Omicron variant-predominant periods and to further assess VE according to prior SARS-CoV-2 infection status and by sublineage during the Omicron variant-predominant period. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This test-negative case-control study was conducted from November 2 to December 9, 2021 (Delta variant), and from January 16 to September 30, 2022 (Omicron variant), among 160 002 children tested at a large national US retail pharmacy chain, for SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase chain reaction (PCR); 62 719 children were tested during the Delta period, and 97 283 were tested during the Omicron period. EXPOSURE: Vaccination with BNT162b2 before SARS-CoV-2 testing vs no vaccination. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR (regardless of the presence of symptoms), and the secondary outcome was confirmed symptomatic infection. Adjusted estimated VE was calculated from multilevel logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 39 117 children tested positive and 131 686 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (total, 170 803; 84 487 [49%] were boys; mean [SD] age was 9 [2] years; 74 236 [43%] were White non-Hispanic or non-Latino; and 37 318 [22%] were Hispanic or Latino). Final VE analyses included 160 002 children without SARS-CoV-2 infection less than 90 days prior. The VE of 2 doses of BNT162b2 against Delta was 85% (95% CI, 80%-89%; median follow-up, 1 month) compared with the Omicron period (20% [95% CI, 17%-23%]; median follow-up, 4 months). The adjusted VE of 2 doses against Omicron at less than 3 months was 39% (95% CI, 36%-42%), and at 3 months or more, it was -1% (95% CI, -6% to 3%). Protection against Omicron was higher among children with vs without infection 90 days or more prior but decreased in all children approximately 3 months after the second dose (58% [95% CI, 49%-66%] with infection vs 37% [95% CI, 34%-41%] without infection at <3 months; 27% [95% CI, 17%-35%] with infection vs -7% [95% CI, -12% to -1%] at ≥3 months without infection). The VE of 2 doses of BNT162b2 at less than 3 months by Omicron sublineage was 40% (95% CI, 36%-43%) for BA.1, 32% (95% CI, 21%-41%) for BA.2/BA.2.12.1, and 50% (95% CI, 37%-60%) for BA.4/BA.5. After 3 months or more, VE was nonsignificant for BA.2/BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5. The VE of a booster dose was 55% (95% CI, 50%-60%) against Omicron, with no evidence of waning at 3 months or more. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that, among children aged 5 to 11 years, 2 doses of BNT162b2 provided modest short-term protection against Omicron infection that was higher for those with prior infection; however, VE waned after approximately 3 months in all children. A booster dose restored protection against Omicron and was maintained for at least 3 months. These findings highlight the continued importance of booster vaccination regardless of history of prior COVID-19.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.46915,"Male;Humans;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;*SARS-CoV-2;*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;BNT162 Vaccine;COVID-19 Testing;Case-Control Studies;Vaccine Efficacy;Vaccination",36515946,PMC9856252

Therefore, we explored real-world effectiveness of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination on subsequent infection in patients with IBD with diverse exposure to immunosuppressive medications. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients in the Veterans Health Administration with IBD diagnosed before December 18, 2020, the start date of the Veterans Health Administration patient vaccination program. IBD medication exposures included mesalamine, thiopurines, anti-tumor necrosis factor biologic agents, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, tofacitinib, methotrexate, and corticosteroid use. We used inverse probability weighting and Cox's regression with vaccination status as a time-updating exposure and computed vaccine effectiveness from incidence rates. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 14,697 patients, 7321 of whom received at least 1 vaccine dose (45.2% Pfizer, 54.8% Moderna). The cohort had median age 68 years, 92.2% were men, 80.4% were White, and 61.8% had ulcerative colitis. In follow-up data through April 20, 2021, unvaccinated individuals had the highest raw proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection (197 [1.34%] vs 7 [0.11%] fully vaccinated). Full vaccination status, but not partial vaccination status, was associated with a 69% reduced hazard of infection relative to an unvaccinated status (hazard ratio, 0.31, 95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.56; P < .001), corresponding to an 80.4% effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Full vaccination (> 7 days after the second dose) against SARS-CoV-2 infection has an ∼80.4% effectiveness in a broad IBD cohort with diverse exposure to immunosuppressive medications. These results may serve to increase patient and provider willingness to pursue vaccination in these settings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1053/j.gastro.2021.05.044,Aged;*COVID-19/complications/immunology/therapy;*COVID-19 Vaccines/adverse effects;Female;Humans;*Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/immunology;*Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/complications/drug therapy/immunology;Male;Retrospective Studies;*SARS-CoV-2/drug effects/immunology;Treatment Outcome;Vaccination;Veterans;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,34048782,PMC8146263

Our aim was to determine the efficacy of the first booster dose against Omicron. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using a well-established inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohort in the Veterans Health Administration. We followed patients on baseline IBD medications through the month of January 2022 during the Omicron COVID-19 wave and created adjusted models for vaccination and boosting effectiveness in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 22,756 patients with IBD were included, of whom 34.9% had received a booster dose. During follow-up, 622 patients (2.7%) were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In adjusted models, booster status was associated with a 30% reduced hazard of SARS-CoV-2 infection (hazard ratio 0.70 vs unvaccinated status, 95% confidence interval 0.56-0.88, P = 0.002), translating to 25.05% effectiveness. Boosted status was also significantly associated with reduced COVID-19 hospitalization (hazard ratio 0.35, 95% confidence interval 0.16-0.74, P = 0.006), demonstrating a 65.06% effectiveness in adjusted models. There was no significant association between vaccination status and all-cause mortality in adjusted models. DISCUSSION: The boosted state was associated with a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospitalization. Efficacy was lower than what has been seen against previous variants and decreased with prolonged duration from the booster. These findings suggest that patients with IBD, especially those who are immunosuppressed, should consider getting a second booster as per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.14309/ajg.0000000000002071,Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Vaccination,36730187,

It remains largely unknown how AD-related immunosuppressive medications affect the development of vaccine-induced immunity. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccine among patients with AD and to assess its effectiveness in protecting against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, COVID-19-associated hospitalization, and mortality. A specific analysis additionally examined whether AD-related immunosuppressive drugs influenced the effectiveness of the vaccine. METHODS: A population-based cohort study was performed using the database of Clalit Heath Services, Israel, to follow adult patients with AD. Multivariate Cox and logistic regression analyses were utilized to calculate the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) of the incident outcomes. RESULTS: As of 26 June, 2021, 58,582 (75.4%) out of 77,682 adult patients with AD completed two BNT162b2 vaccine doses in Israel. Adulthood-onset AD (adjusted OR, 1.34; 95% CI 1.28-1.40; p < 0.001) and moderate-to-severe AD (adjusted OR, 1.13; 95% CI 1.05-1.21; p = 0.001) predicted an increased vaccination rate. Vaccinated patients with AD demonstrated a significantly decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted HR, 0.20; 95% CI 0.16-0.26; p < 0.001), COVID-19-associated hospitalization (adjusted HR, 0.08; 95% CI 0.04-0.18; p < 0.001), and COVID-19-associated mortality (adjusted HR, 0.04; 95% CI 0.01-0.20; p < 0.001).

METHODS: We conducted a 21-site case-control analysis of 10 425 adults hospitalized in March to December 2021. Cases were hospitalized with COVID-19; controls were hospitalized for an alternative diagnosis (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-negative). Participants were classified as follows: SOT recipient (n = 440), other immunocompromising condition (n = 1684), or immunocompetent (n = 8301). The VE against COVID-19-associated hospitalization was calculated as 1-adjusted odds ratio of prior vaccination among cases compared with controls. RESULTS: Among SOT recipients, VE was 29% (95% confidence interval [CI], -19% to 58%) for 2 doses and 77% (95% CI, 48% to 90%) for 3 doses.

Therefore, we aimed to conduct one of the first evaluations of vaccine effectiveness against breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients with cancer at a population level. METHODS: In this population-based test-negative case-control study of the UK Coronavirus Cancer Evaluation Project (UKCCEP), we extracted data from the UKCCEP registry on all SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results (from the Second Generation Surveillance System), vaccination records (from the National Immunisation Management Service), patient demographics, and cancer records from England, UK, from Dec 8, 2020, to Oct 15, 2021. Adults (aged ≥18 years) with cancer in the UKCCEP registry were identified via Public Health England's Rapid Cancer Registration Dataset between Jan 1, 2018, and April 30, 2021, and comprised the cancer cohort. We constructed a control population cohort from adults with PCR tests in the UKCCEP registry who were not contained within the Rapid Cancer Registration Dataset. The coprimary endpoints were overall vaccine effectiveness against breakthrough infections after the second dose (positive PCR COVID-19 test) and vaccine effectiveness against breakthrough infections at 3-6 months after the second dose in the cancer cohort and control population. FINDINGS: The cancer cohort comprised 377 194 individuals, of whom 42 882 had breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections. The control population consisted of 28 010 955 individuals, of whom 5 748 708 had SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections. Overall vaccine effectiveness was 69·8% (95% CI 69·8-69·9) in the control population and 65·5% (65·1-65·9) in the cancer cohort. Vaccine effectiveness at 3-6 months was lower in the cancer cohort (47·0%, 46·3-47·6) than in the control population (61·4%, 61·4-61·5). INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 vaccination is effective for individuals with cancer, conferring varying levels of protection against breakthrough infections. However, vaccine effectiveness is lower in patients with cancer than in the general population. COVID-19 vaccination for patients with cancer should be used in conjunction with non-pharmacological strategies and community-based antiviral treatment programmes to reduce the risk that COVID-19 poses to patients with cancer.

Coronavirus third dose vaccine boosters are proposed to boost waning immune responses in immunocompromised individuals and increase coronavirus protection; however, their effectiveness has not yet been systematically evaluated. METHODS: This study is a population-scale real-world evaluation of the United Kingdom's third dose vaccine booster programme for cancer patients from 8th December 2020 to 7th December 2021. The cancer cohort comprises individuals from Public Health England's national cancer dataset, excluding individuals less than 18 years. A test-negative case-control design was used to assess the third dose booster vaccine effectiveness. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to compare risk in the cancer cohort relative to the general population. RESULTS: The cancer cohort comprised of 2,258,553 tests from 361,098 individuals. Third dose boosters were evaluated by reference to 87,039,743 polymerase chain reaction coronavirus tests. Vaccine effectiveness against breakthrough infections, symptomatic infections, coronavirus hospitalisation and death in cancer patients were 59.1%, 62.8%, 80.5% and 94.5%, respectively. Lower vaccine effectiveness was associated with a cancer diagnosis within 12 months, lymphoma, recent systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) or radiotherapy. Patients with lymphoma had low levels of protection from symptomatic disease. In spite of third dose boosters, following multivariable adjustment, individuals with cancer remain at an increased risk of coronavirus hospitalisation and death compared to the population control (OR 3.38, 3.01, respectively. p &lt; 0.001 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Third dose boosters are effective for most individuals with cancer, increasing protection from coronavirus. However, their effectiveness is heterogenous and lower than the general population. Many patients with cancer will remain at the increased risk of coronavirus infections even after 3 doses. In the case of patients with lymphoma, there is a particularly strong disparity of vaccine effectiveness against breakthrough infection and severe disease. Breakthrough infections will disrupt cancer care and treatment with potentially adverse consequences on survival outcomes. The data support the role of vaccine boosters in preventing severe disease, and further pharmacological intervention to prevent transmission and aid viral clearance to limit the disruption of cancer care as the delivery of care continues to evolve during the coronavirus pandemic.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1016/j.ejca.2022.06.038,*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;Hospitalization;Humans;*Neoplasms;Pandemics;Vaccination;Vaccine Efficacy,36084618,PMC9276646

We report the impact of cancer and other risk factors in US Veterans receiving care at Veterans Administration (VA) Hospitals, their adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for infection and death, and report on the impact of vaccines on the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infections in Veterans without/with cancer. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of US Veterans without/with cancer by mining VA COVID-19 Shared Data Resource (CSDR) data using the VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI). Our observation period includes index dates from 14DEC2020 to 25JAN2022, encompassing both the delta and omicron waves in the US. RESULTS: We identified 915,928 Veterans, 24% of whom were African Americans who had undergone COVID testing-688,541 were and 227,387 were not vaccinated. 157,072 had a cancer diagnosis in the preceding two years. Age emerged as the major risk factor, with gender, BMI, and (Elixhauser) comorbidity contributing less. Among veterans with solid tumors other than lung cancer, risks of infection and death within 60 days were comparable to Veterans without cancer. However, those with hematologic malignancies fared worse. Vaccination was highly effective across all cancer cohorts; the respective rates of infection and death after infection were 8% and 5% among the vaccinated compared to 47% and 10% in the unvaccinated. Amongst vaccinated, increased risk of infection was noted in both, Veterans with hematologic malignancy treated with chemotherapy (HR, 2.993, P < 0.0001) or targeted therapies (HR, 1.781, P < 0.0001), and in solid tumors treated with either chemotherapy (HR 2.328, 95%CI 2.075-2.611, P < 0.0001) or targeted therapies (HR 1.328, P < 0.0001) when compared to those not on treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Risk for COVID-19 infection and death from infection vary based on cancer type and therapies administered. Importantly and encouragingly, the duration of protection from infection following vaccination in Veterans with a diagnosis of cancer was remarkably like those without a cancer diagnosis. Veterans with hematologic malignancies are especially vulnerable, with lower vaccine effectiveness (VE).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1053/j.seminoncol.2022.07.005,Humans;*COVID-19/complications/epidemiology/prevention & control;*Veterans;Incidence;Cohort Studies;Prospective Studies;COVID-19 Testing;*Vaccines;*Hematologic Neoplasms;Vaccination;Veterans,36055952,PMC9353607

In addition, it is possible that vaccine-triggered immune activation could trigger immune dysregulation and thus exacerbate inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In this population-based study we used the epi-Israeli IBD Research Nucleus validated cohort to explore the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in IBD and to assess its effect on disease outcomes. METHODS: We included all IBD patients insured in 2 of the 4 Israeli health maintenance organizations, covering 35% of the population. Patients receiving 2 Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine doses between December 2020 and June 2021 were individually matched to non-IBD controls. To assess IBD outcomes, we matched vaccinated to unvaccinated IBD patients, and response was analyzed per medical treatment. RESULTS: In total, 12,109 IBD patients received 2 vaccine doses, of whom 4946 were matched to non-IBD controls (mean age, 51 ± 16 years; median follow-up, 22 weeks; interquartile range, 4-24). Fifteen patients in each group (0.3%) developed COVID-19 after vaccination (odds ratio, 1; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-2.05; P = 1.0). Patients on tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors and/or corticosteroids did not have a higher incidence of infection. To explore IBD outcomes, 707 vaccinated IBD patients were compared with unvaccinated IBD patients by stringent matching (median follow-up, 14 weeks; interquartile range, 2.3-20.4). The risk of exacerbation was 29% in the vaccinated patients compared with 26% in unvaccinated patients (P = .3). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in IBD patients is comparable with that in non-IBD controls and is not influenced by treatment with TNF inhibitors or corticosteroids. The IBD exacerbation rate did not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1016/j.cgh.2021.12.026,Adult;Aged;*BNT162 Vaccine/adverse effects/therapeutic use;*COVID-19/prevention & control;Chronic Disease;Disease Progression;Humans;*Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/complications/drug therapy;Middle Aged;SARS-CoV-2;Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors/therapeutic use;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Vaccination;Vaccines,34954338,PMC8697416

Adults in the United States (US) began receiving the adenovirus vector coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson & Johnson [Janssen]), in February 2021. We evaluated Ad26.COV2.S vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 hospitalization and high disease severity during the first 10 months of its use. Methods . In a multicenter case-control analysis of US adults (≥18 years) hospitalized 11 March to 15 December 2021, we estimated VE against susceptibility to COVID-19 hospitalization (VEs), comparing odds of prior vaccination with a single dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine between hospitalized cases with COVID-19 and controls without COVID-19. Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, we estimated VE against disease progression (VEp) to death or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), comparing odds of prior vaccination between patients with and without progression. Results . After excluding patients receiving mRNA vaccines, among 3979 COVID-19 case-patients (5% vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S) and 2229 controls (13% vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S), VEs of Ad26.COV2.S against COVID-19 hospitalization was 70% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 63-75%) overall, including 55% (29-72%) among immunocompromised patients, and 72% (64-77%) among immunocompetent patients, for whom VEs was similar at 14-90 days (73% [59-82%]), 91-180 days (71% [60-80%]), and 181-274 days (70% [54-81%]) postvaccination. Among hospitalized COVID-19 case-patients, VEp was 46% (18-65%) among immunocompetent patients. Conclusions . The Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization by 72% among immunocompetent adults without waning through 6 months postvaccination. After hospitalization for COVID-19, vaccinated immunocompetent patients were less likely to require IMV or die compared to unvaccinated immunocompetent patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: case-control",10.1093/cid/ciac439,"Ad26COVS1;Adult;*COVID-19/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines;Hospitalization;Humans;*Influenza Vaccines;*Influenza, Human/prevention & control;Severity of Illness Index;United States/epidemiology;Vaccination;United States",35675695,PMC9214149

Interpretation of rVE differs from traditional studies measuring absolute VE (aVE) of a vaccine regimen against an unvaccinated referent group. We estimated aVE and rVE against COVID-19 hospitalization in primary-series plus first-booster recipients of COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: Booster-eligible immunocompetent adults hospitalized at 21 medical centers in the United States during December 25, 2021-April 4, 2022 were included. In a test-negative design, logistic regression with case status as the outcome and completion of primary vaccine series or primary series plus 1 booster dose as the predictors, adjusted for potential confounders, were used to estimate aVE and rVE. RESULTS: A total of 2060 patients were analyzed, including 1104 COVID-19 cases and 956 controls. Relative VE against COVID-19 hospitalization in boosted mRNA vaccine recipients versus primary series only was 66% (95% confidence interval [CI], 55%-74%); aVE was 81% (95% CI, 75%-86%) for boosted versus 46% (95% CI, 30%-58%) for primary. For boosted Janssen vaccine recipients versus primary series, rVE was 49% (95% CI, -9% to 76%); aVE was 62% (95% CI, 33%-79%) for boosted versus 36% (95% CI, -4% to 60%) for primary. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine booster doses increased protection against COVID-19 hospitalization compared with a primary series. Comparing rVE measures across studies can lead to flawed interpretations of the added value of a new vaccination regimen, whereas difference in aVE, when available, may be a more useful metric.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1093/ofid/ofac698,"Vaccination;Hospital Units;RNA, Messenger;United States;Vaccines",36695662,PMC9868348

OBJECTIVE: To obtain population-based estimates of the probability of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and the effectiveness associated with vaccination after recovery from COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used Rhode Island statewide surveillance data from March 1, 2020, to December 9, 2021, on COVID-19 vaccinations, laboratory-confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and fatalities to conduct a population-based, retrospective study during periods when wild type, Alpha, and Delta strains of SARS-CoV-2 were predominant. Participants included Rhode Island residents aged 12 years and older who were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 and unvaccinated at the time of first infection, stratified into 3 subpopulations: long-term congregate care (LTCC) residents, LTCC employees, and the general population (ie, individuals not associated with congregate settings). Data were analyzed from October 2021 to January 2022. EXPOSURES: Completion of the primary vaccination series, defined as 14 days after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine or 1 dose of vector virus vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, defined as a laboratory-confirmed positive result on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antigen test at least 90 days after the first laboratory-confirmed positive result on a PCR or antigen test. RESULTS: Overall, 3124 LTCC residents (median [IQR] age, 81 [71-89]; 1675 [53.6%] females), 2877 LTCC employees (median [IQR] age, 41 [30-53]; 2186 [76.0%] females), and 94 516 members of the general population (median [IQR] age, 35 [24-52] years; 45 030 [47.6%] females) met eligibility criteria. Probability of reinfection at 9 months for those who remained unvaccinated after recovery from prior COVID-19 was 13.0% (95% CI, 12.0%-14.0%) among LTCC residents, 10.0% (95% CI, 8.8%-11.5%) among LTCC employees, and 1.9% (95% CI, 1.8%-2.0%) among the general population. Completion of the primary vaccination series after infection was associated with 49% (95% CI, 27%-65%) protection among LTCC residents, 47% (95% CI, 19%-65%) protection among LTCC employees, and 62% (95% CI, 56%-68%) protection in the general population against reinfection, adjusting for potential sociodemographic and clinical confounders and temporal variation in infection rates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection after recovery from COVID-19 was relatively high among individuals who remained unvaccinated.

This study was conducted in the resident population of Labuan aged ≥18 years who had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 by Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction between 1 March 2021 and 31 October 2021. We used a test-negative case-control design where 2644 pairs of cases and controls were matched by age, sex, testing date, nationality and testing reason. Analysis was stratified by age group to estimate age effect (<60 years and ≥60 years). Of 22217 individuals tested by Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, 5100 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and aged 18 years and above. Overall vaccine effectiveness ≥ 14 days after the second dose was 65.2% (95% CI: 59.8-69.9%) against COVID-19 infection, 92.5% (95% CI: 72.3-98.8%) against intensive care unit admission, and 96.5% (95% CI: 82.3-99.8%) against COVID-19 deaths. Among infected individuals, vaccine effectiveness was 79.2% (95% CI: 42.3-94.1%) in preventing severe or critical disease due to COVID-19.

The objective of this study was to estimate the effectiveness of primary (two-dose series) and booster (third dose) mRNA vaccination against Omicron (lineage BA.1) infection among people with a prior documented infection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a test-negative case-control study of reverse transcription PCRs (RT-PCRs) analyzed with the TaqPath (Thermo Fisher Scientific) assay and recorded in the Yale New Haven Health system from November 1, 2021, to April 30, 2022. Overall, 11,307 cases (positive TaqPath analyzed RT-PCRs with S-gene target failure [SGTF]) and 130,041 controls (negative TaqPath analyzed RT-PCRs) were included (median age: cases: 35 years, controls: 39 years). Among cases and controls, 5.9% and 8.1% had a documented prior infection (positive SARS-CoV-2 test record ≥90 days prior to the included test), respectively. We estimated the effectiveness of primary and booster vaccination relative to SGTF-defined Omicron (lineage BA.1) variant infection using a logistic regression adjusted for date of test, age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance, comorbidities, social venerability index, municipality, and healthcare utilization. The effectiveness of primary vaccination 14 to 149 days after the second dose was 41.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 14.1% to 59.4%, p 0.006) and 27.1% (95% CI: 18.7% to 34.6%, p < 0.001) for people with and without a documented prior infection, respectively. The effectiveness of booster vaccination (≥14 days after booster dose) was 47.1% (95% CI: 22.4% to 63.9%, p 0.001) and 54.1% (95% CI: 49.2% to 58.4%, p < 0.001) in people with and without a documented prior infection, respectively. To test whether booster vaccination reduced the risk of infection beyond that of the primary series, we compared the odds of infection among boosted (≥14 days after booster dose) and booster-eligible people (≥150 days after second dose). The odds ratio (OR) comparing boosted and booster-eligible people with a documented prior infection was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.54 to 1.16, p 0.222), whereas the OR comparing boosted and booster-eligible people without a documented prior infection was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.49 to 0.59, p < 0.001). This study's limitations include the risk of residual confounding, the use of data from a single system, and the reliance on TaqPath analyzed RT-PCR results. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that primary vaccination provided significant but limited protection against Omicron (lineage BA.1) infection among people with and without a documented prior infection. While booster vaccination was associated with additional protection against Omicron BA.1 infection in people without a documented prior infection, it was not found to be associated with additional protection among people with a documented prior infection. These findings support primary vaccination in people regardless of documented prior infection status but suggest that infection history may impact the relative benefit of booster doses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1371/journal.pmed.1004136,"Humans;Adult;*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;SARS-CoV-2/genetics;Case-Control Studies;Odds Ratio;Vaccination;RNA, Messenger",36454733,PMC9714718

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rate ratio (RR) of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hazard ratio (HR) of COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. RESULTS: The median age among the 10.6 million participants was 39 years; 51.3% were female, 71.5% were White, and 9.9% were Hispanic. As of June 3, 2022, 67% of participants had been vaccinated. There were 2 771 364 SARS-CoV-2 infections, with a hospitalization rate of 6.3% and mortality rate of 1.4%. The adjusted RR of the primary vaccine series compared with being unvaccinated against infection became 0.53 (95% CI, 0.52-0.53) for BNT162b2, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.51-0.53) for mRNA-1273, and 0.51 (95% CI, 0.50-0.53) for Ad26.COV2.S 10 months after the first dose, but the adjusted HR for hospitalization remained at 0.29 (95% CI, 0.24-0.35) for BNT162b2, 0.27 (95% CI, 0.23-0.32) for mRNA-1273, and 0.35 (95% CI, 0.29-0.42) for Ad26.COV2.S and the adjusted HR of death remained at 0.23 (95% CI, 0.17-0.29) for BNT162b2, 0.15 (95% CI, 0.11-0.20) for mRNA-1273, and 0.24 (95% CI, 0.19-0.31) for Ad26.COV2.S. For the BNT162b2 primary series, boosting in December 2021 with BNT162b2 had the adjusted RR relative to primary series of 0.39 (95% CI, 0.38-0.40) and boosting with mRNA-1273 had the adjusted RR of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.30-0.34) against infection after 1 month and boosting with BNT162b2 had the adjusted RR of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.82-0.86) and boosting with mRNA-1273 had the adjusted RR of 0.60 (95% CI, 0.57-0.62) after 3 months. Among all participants, the adjusted RR of Omicron infection compared with no prior infection was estimated at 0.23 (95% CI, 0.22-0.24) against infection, and the adjusted HRs were 0.10 (95% CI, 0.07-0.14) against hospitalization and 0.11 (95% CI, 0.08-0.15) against death after 4 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Receipt of primary COVID-19 vaccine series compared with being unvaccinated, receipt of boosters compared with primary vaccination, and prior infection compared with no prior infection were all significantly associated with lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (including Omicron) and resulting hospitalization and death. The associated protection waned over time, especially against infection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1001/jama.2022.17876,Ad26COVS1;Adult;BNT162 Vaccine;*COVID-19/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines;Cohort Studies;Female;Humans;Male;SARS-CoV-2;Vaccination;*Viral Vaccines/administration & dosage,36155617,PMC9513711

Over the 6-week follow-up, we estimated one hospitalisation/death was avoided for every 192 adults aged ≥70 years boosted with dose 3 in the infection-naiive cohort. The aHR for hospitalisation/death from Omicron was 0.12 (95 %CI 0.07-0.23) for 2-dose recipients with a prior Delta infection compared with 2-dose recipients with no prior infection. CONCLUSIONS: Receipt of a third COVID-19 vaccine dose in adults aged 40 years and above significantly reduced hospitalisations and deaths from SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infections in a primarily infection-naiive population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.09.029,"Australia/epidemiology;BNT162 Vaccine;*COVID-19/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines;Cohort Studies;Humans;Middle Aged;SARS-CoV-2;Vaccination;Vaccines, Synthetic;*Viral Vaccines;mRNA Vaccines",36180375,PMC9489983

OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 breakthrough infections among vaccinated individuals and to reassess the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination against severe outcomes using real-world data. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a series of observational retrospective analyses using the electronic health records (EHRs) of Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian (CUIMC/NYP) up to September 21, 2021. New York adult residence with PCR test records were included in this analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Poisson regression was used to assess the association between breakthrough infection rate in vaccinated individuals and multiple risk factors - including vaccine brand, demographics, and underlying conditions - while adjusting for calendar month, prior number of visits and observational days. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between vaccine administration and infection rate by comparing a vaccinated cohort to a historically matched cohort in the pre-vaccinated period. Infection incident rate was also compared between vaccinated individuals and longitudinally matched unvaccinated individuals. Cox regression was used to estimate the association of the vaccine and COVID-19 associated severe outcomes by comparing breakthrough cohort and two matched unvaccinated infection cohorts. RESULTS: Individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BNT162b2 (IRR against Moderna/mRNA-1273 [95% CI]: 1.66 [1.17 - 2.35]); were male (1.47 [1.11 - 1.94%]); and had compromised immune systems (1.48 [1.09 - 2.00]) were at the highest risk for breakthrough infections. Vaccinated individuals had a significant lower infection rate among all subgroups. An increased incidence rate was found in both vaccines over the time. Among individuals infected with COVID-19, vaccination significantly reduced the risk of death (adj. HR: 0.20 [0.08 - 0.49]). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: While we found both mRNA vaccines were effective, Moderna/mRNA-1273 had a lower incidence rate of breakthrough infections. Both vaccines had increased incidence rates over the time. Immunocompromised individuals were among the highest risk groups experiencing breakthrough infections. Given the rapidly changing nature of the SARS-CoV-2, continued monitoring and a generalizable analysis pipeline are warranted to inform quick updates on vaccine effectiveness in real time. KEY POINTS: Question: What risk factors contribute to COVID-19 breakthrough infections among mRNA vaccinated individuals? How do clinical outcomes differ between vaccinated but still SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and non-vaccinated, infected individuals?Findings: This retrospective study uses CUIMC/NYP EHR data up to September 21, 2021. Individuals who were vaccinated with Pfizer/BNT162b2, male, and had compromised immune systems had significantly higher incidence rate ratios of breakthrough infections. Comparing demographically matched pre-vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, vaccinated individuals had a lower incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection among all subgroups.Meaning: Leveraging real-world EHR data provides insight on who may optimally benefit from a booster COVID-19 vaccination.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2021.10.05.21264583,"Vaccination;Risk Factors;RNA, Messenger;Vaccines",34642696,PMC8509087

OBJECTIVE: Study objectives include estimating incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in essential workers by symptom presentation and demographic factors, determining independent effects of occupational and community exposures on incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, establishing molecular and immunologic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in essential workers, describing the duration and patterns of rRT-PCR-positivity, and examining post-vaccine immunologic response. METHODS: Eligible participants include Arizona residents aged 18-85 years who work at least 20 hours per week in an occupation involving regular direct contact (within three feet) with others. Recruitment goals are stratified by demographic characteristics (50% aged 40 or older, 50% women, and 50% Hispanic or American Indian), by occupation (40% healthcare personnel, 30% first responders, and 30% other essential workers), and by prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (with up to 50% seropositive at baseline). Information on sociodemographics, health and medical history, vaccination status, exposures to individuals with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, use of personal protective equipment, and perceived risks are collected at enrollment and updated through quarterly surveys. Every week, participants complete active surveillance for COVID-19-like illness (CLI) and self-collect nasal swabs. Additional self-collected nasal swab and saliva specimens are collected in the event of CLI onset. Respiratory specimens are sent to Marshfield Laboratories and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. CLI symptoms and impact on work and productivity are followed through illness resolution. Serum specimens are collected every 3 months and additional sera are collected following incident rRT-PCR positivity and after each COVID-19 vaccine dose. Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections will be calculated by person-weeks at risk and compared by occupation and demographic characteristics and by seropositivity status and infection and vaccination history. RESULTS: The AZ HEROES study was funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Enrollment began July 27, 2020 and as of May 1, 2021 a total of 3,165 participants have been enrolled in the study. CONCLUSIONS: AZ HEROES is unique in aiming to recruit a diverse sample of essential workers and prospectively following strata of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative and seropositive adults. Survey results combined with active surveillance data on exposure, CLI, weekly molecular diagnostic testing, and periodic serology will be used to estimate the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, assess the intensity and durability of immune responses to natural infection and COVID-19 vaccination, and contribute to the evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness.

We calculated vaccine effectiveness as 1 - rate ratio (RR), with RR determined by adjusting Poisson models with the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as the outcome and the vaccination status as the main variable. We used the logarithmic link function and simple models adjusting for sex, age, and job types. RESULTS: In total, 13,813 HCWs met the inclusion criteria for this analysis. Among them, 6,385 (46.2%) received the CoronaVac vaccine, 5,916 (42.8%) received the ChAdOx1 vaccine, and 1,512 (11.0%) were not vaccinated. Overall, COVID-19 occurred in 6% of unvaccinated HCWs, 3% of HCWs who received 2 doses of CoronaVac vaccine, and 0.7% of HCWs who received 2 doses of ChAdOx1 vaccine (P < .001). In the adjusted analyses, the estimated vaccine effectiveness rates were 51.3% for CoronaVac, and 88.1% for ChAdOx1 vaccine.

In addition, 19 SARS-CoV-2 samples from 19 HCWs were screened for mutations of interest. Of 19 samples, 18 were the γ (gamma) variant. CONCLUSIONS: Although both COVID-19 vaccines (viral vector and inactivated virus) can significantly prevent COVID-19 among HCWs, CoronaVac was much less effective. The COVID-19 vaccines were also effective against the dominant γ variant.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1017/ice.2022.50,Humans;Adolescent;Adult;COVID-19 Vaccines;Retrospective Studies;SARS-CoV-2;*COVID-19/prevention & control;*Pneumonia;Health Personnel;Vaccination,35351217,PMC9002147

Cuban protein subunit vaccine Abdala has shown safety, tolerability and efficacy (92·3% [95% CI: 85·7‒95·8]) against SARS-CoV-2 in clinical trials. This study aimed to estimate Abdala's real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study in Havana analyzed Cuban Ministry of Public Health databases (May 12-August 31, 2021) to assess VE in preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19 (primary outcomes). Cox models accounting for time-varying vaccination status and adjusting by demographics were used to estimate hazard ratios. A subgroup analysis by age group and a sensitivity analysis including a subgroup of tested persons (qRT-PCR) were conducted. Daily cases and deaths were modelled accounting for different VE. FINDINGS: The study included 1 355 638 persons (Mean age: 49·5 years [SD: 18·2]; 704 932 female [52·0%]; ethnicity data unavailable): 1 324 vaccinated (partially/fully) and 31 433 unvaccinated.

There is less evidence on effectiveness in real-world settings, especially for older people. Here, we aimed to estimate vaccine effectiveness in the context of the rapid NHS mass-vaccination programme in England, exploiting age-based vaccination eligibility thresholds to minimise and correct for selection bias. METHODS: We studied 170,226 individuals between the ages of 80 and 83 years from community settings outside care homes who received one dose of BNT162b2 mRNA between the 15 and 20 December 2020 and were scheduled a second dose 21 days later. We matched these vaccine recipients to slightly younger (aged 76-79 years) persons not yet eligible to receive the vaccine on gender, area of residence, area deprivation, health status, living arrangements, acute illness, and history of seasonal flu vaccination. We compared their rates of COVID-19 positivity and hospitalisation in the subsequent 45 days. We adjusted for the increasing concentration of COVID-19 positivity in the control population caused by the requirement to have no COVID-19 symptoms prior to vaccination. RESULTS: Emergency hospital admissions were 51.0% (95% confidence interval 19.9 to 69.5%) lower and positive COVID-19 tests were 55.2% (40.8 to 66.8%) lower for vaccinated individuals compared to matched controls 21 to 27 days after first vaccination. Emergency admissions were 75.6% (52.8 to 87.6%) lower, and positive COVID-19 tests were 70.1% (55.1 to 80.1%) lower 35 to 41 days after first vaccination when 79% of participants had received a second dose within 26 days of their first dose. CONCLUSIONS: Receipt of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is effective at reducing COVID-19 hospitalisations and infections.

The Acute Respiratory Infection Surveillance System (SiVIRA in Spanish) is based on a sentinel network for acute respiratory infection (ARI) surveillance in primary care and a network of sentinel hospitals for severe ARI (SARI) surveillance in hospitals. METHODS: Using a test-negative design and data from SARI admissions notified to SiVIRA between January 1 and October 3, 2021, we estimated COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization, by age group, vaccine type, time since vaccination, and SARS-CoV-2 variant. RESULTS: VE was 89% (95% CI: 83-93) against COVID-19 hospitalization overall in persons aged 20 years and older. VE was higher for mRNA vaccines, and lower for those aged 80 years and older, with a decrease in protection beyond 3 months of completing vaccination, and a further decrease after 5 months. We found no differences between periods with circulation of Alpha or Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants, although variant-specific VE was slightly higher against Alpha. CONCLUSIONS: The SiVIRA sentinel hospital surveillance network in Spain was able to describe clinical and epidemiological characteristics of SARI hospitalizations and provide estimates of COVID-19 VE in the population under surveillance. Our estimates add to evidence of high effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against severe COVID-19 and waning of protection with time since vaccination in those aged 80 or older.

However, data on the effectiveness of an mRNA vaccine booster in preventing infection, hospitalization, and death in this vulnerable population are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between receipt of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine booster and prevention of infection, hospitalization, or death among nursing home residents. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study emulated sequentially nested target trials for vaccination using data from 2 large multistate US nursing home systems: Genesis HealthCare, a community nursing home operator (system 1) and Veterans Health Administration community living centers (VHA CLCs; system 2). The cohort included long-term (≥100 days) nursing home residents (10 949 residents from 202 community nursing homes and 4321 residents from 128 VHA CLCs) who completed a 2-dose series of an mRNA vaccine (either BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] or mRNA-1273 [Moderna]) and were eligible for a booster dose between September 22 and November 30, 2021. Residents were followed up until March 8, 2022. EXPOSURES: Receipt of a third mRNA vaccine dose, defined as a booster dose (boosted group), or nonreceipt of a booster dose (unboosted group) on an eligible target trial date. If participants in the unboosted group received a booster dose on a later target trial date, they were included in the booster group for that target trial; thus, participants could be included in both the boosted and unboosted groups. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Test-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, or death was followed up to 12 weeks after booster vaccination. The primary measure of estimated vaccine effectiveness was the ratio of cumulative incidences in the boosted group vs the unboosted group at week 12, adjusted with inverse probability weights for treatment and censoring. RESULTS: System 1 included 202 community nursing homes; among 8332 boosted residents (5325 [63.9%] female; 6685 [80.2%] White) vs 10 886 unboosted residents (6865 [63.1%] female; 8651 [79.5%] White), the median age was 78 (IQR, 68-87) years vs 78 (IQR, 68-86) years. System 2 included 128 VHA CLCs; among 3289 boosted residents (3157 [96.0%] male; 1950 [59.3%] White) vs 4317 unboosted residents (4151 [96.2%] male; 2434 [56.4%] White), the median age was 74 (IQR, 70-80) vs 74 (IQR, 69-80) years. Booster vaccination was associated with reductions in SARS-CoV-2 infections of 37.7% (95% CI, 25.4%-44.2%) in system 1 and 57.7% (95% CI, 43.5%-67.8%) in system 2. For hospitalization, reductions of 74.4% (95% CI, 44.6%-86.2%) in system 1 and 64.1% (95% CI, 41.3%-76.0%) in system 2 were observed. Estimated vaccine effectiveness for death associated with SARS-CoV-2 was 87.9% (95% CI, 75.9%-93.9%) in system 1; however, although a reduction in death was observed in system 2 (46.6%; 95% CI, -34.6% to 94.8%), this reduction was not statistically significant. A total of 45 SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths occurred in system 1 and 18 deaths occurred in system 2. For the combined end point of SARS-CoV-2-associated hospitalization or death, boosted residents in system 1 had an 80.3% (95% CI, 65.7%-88.5%) reduction, and boosted residents in system 2 had a 63.8% (95% CI, 41.4%-76.1%) reduction. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, during a period in which both the Delta and Omicron variants were circulating, SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccination was associated with significant reductions in SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalizations, and the combined end point of hospitalization or death among residents of 2 US nursing home systems. These findings suggest that administration of vaccine boosters to nursing home residents may have an important role in preventing COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.45417,"Female;Male;Humans;Aged;*COVID-19 Vaccines;BNT162 Vaccine;Cohort Studies;SARS-CoV-2;*COVID-19/prevention & control;Nursing Homes;Nurses, Community Health;Vaccination",36477482,PMC9856563

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cohort study used 100% Medicare claims from January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2021, and matched 3,940,475 individuals who received boosters to 3,940,475 controls based on week and type of original COVID-19 vaccine and demographic and clinical characteristics. We compared the association of booster vs no booster with COVID-19 hospitalization using Cox proportional hazards regression models controlling for patient characteristics. We also determined the association of time from original vaccine to booster with COVID-19 hospitalization. RESULTS: Over a maximum of 130 days of follow-up, boosted enrollees had 8.20 (95% CI, 7.81 to 8.60) COVID-19 hospitalizations per million days vs 43.70 (95% CI, 42.79 to 44.64) for controls (81% effectiveness). Effectiveness varied by race, prior hospitalizations, and certain comorbidities, for example, leukemia/lymphoma (53% effectiveness), autoimmune disease (73%), and dementia (73%). Boosters received between 6 and 9 months after original vaccination varied between 81% and 85% effectiveness, while boosters received at 5 to 6 months (62%) or less than 5 months (58%) were less effective. CONCLUSION: Boosters are highly effective in the Medicare population. Approximately 69,225 hospitalizations would be prevented by boosters in the 15 million individuals aged 65 years or older currently not boosted in a period similar to the September 2020 through January 2021 period studied.

Presently, the entire world faces a challenging crisis of ""Severe Acute Respiratory Diseases Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as the COVID-19 pandemic"". The impact of vaccines at national levels to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths are unclear, and people have concerns about the effectiveness of vaccines in real-world settings. This study's objective was to examine the effect of the ""Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca"" vaccines to prevent SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths in Saudi Arabia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we collected data on SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths from the date of the first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Saudi Arabia March 2, 2020, to the date of launching the vaccination campaign on December 14, 2020; and from December 15, 2020, to September 8, 2021.

METHODS: Nursing home staff, long-term residents and day-care receivers were included in a retrospective cohort study. We calculated attack rates (AR), secondary AR (SAR) and their 95% binomial confidence interval (CI), and we compared them using Fisher's exact test or chi-squared test, depending on the sample size. We used Poisson regression with robust error estimates to calculate vaccine effectiveness against SARS-COV-2 infections. We selected variables based on directed acyclic graphs. As a proxy for viral load at diagnosis, we compared the mean Ct values at diagnosis using t tests or Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: The adjusted vaccine effectiveness against infection was 56% (95% CI: 15-77%, p = 0.04). Ct values at diagnosis were higher when intervals after receiving the second vaccination were longer (>21 vs. ≤21 days: 4.48 cycles, p = 0.08). The SAR was 67% lower in households of vaccinated (2/9 [22.2%]) than of unvaccinated infected staff (12/18 [66.7%]; p = 0.046). Vaccination rates were lowest among staff with close physical contact to care-receivers (46%). The highest AR in vaccinated staff had those working on wards (14%). CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination reduced the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, viral load and transmission; however, non-pharmaceutical interventions remain essential to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infections, even for vaccinated individuals.

Our objective was to assess demographic, clinical, and outcome variables of patients requiring hospitalization for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection comparing fully vaccinated and boosted (FV&B), fully vaccinated (FV), and unvaccinated (UV) patients. METHODS: This multicenter observational cohort analysis compared demographic, clinical, and outcome variables in FV&B, FV, and UV adults hospitalized for COVID-19. Partially vaccinated (PV) and individuals still hospitalized beyond the designated follow-up date of February 1, 2022 were excluded. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints included characteristics and outcomes in subpopulations of intensive care and geriatric (age >65) patients. FINDINGS: Between August 12th, 2021 and January 20th, 2022, 8232 patient encounters had a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 and required inpatient treatment. Of the 8232 encounters requiring hospitalization, 448 (5.8%) were FV&B, 2257 (29.2%) were FV, and 5023 (65.0%) were UV; 357 PV and 147 still hospitalized were excluded. The median age of FV&B cohort was 73 (IQR 62, 82) compared to 70 (IQR 59, 80) for FV and 59 (IQR 45, 71) for UV (0.001). Most patients were female in both the FB&V and UV groups with 51.1% and 51.8%, respectively, while the FV group had a majority of males (51.3%). The median Elixhauser weighted score was 12 (IQR 3, 22) for FV&B, 10 (IQR 2, 20) for FV, and 9 (IQR 0, 17) for UV groups (p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality was 7.1% in the FV&B, 10.3% in the FV group, and 12.8% in the UV group (p < 0.001). The FV&B group had lower in-hospital mortality than both FV and UV groups (p = 0.045 and p = 0.001, respectively). The FV group had lower in-hospital mortality than the UV group (p = 0.004). INTERPRETATION: Fully vaccinated and boosted patients requiring hospital-level care for breakthrough COVID-19 have lower in-hospital mortality than fully vaccinated and unvaccinated patients despite being older and higher risk at baseline. Boosters offer added protection beyond full vaccination in preventing death.

The high effectiveness of the widely administered BNT162b vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech in preventing not only the disease but also infection with SARS-CoV-2 suggests a potential for a population-level effect, which is critical for disease eradication. However, this putative effect is difficult to observe, especially in light of highly fluctuating spatiotemporal epidemic dynamics. Here, by analyzing vaccination records and test results collected during the rapid vaccine rollout in a large population from 177 geographically defined communities, we find that the rates of vaccination in each community are associated with a substantial later decline in infections among a cohort of individuals aged under 16 years, who are unvaccinated. On average, for each 20 percentage points of individuals who are vaccinated in a given population, the positive test fraction for the unvaccinated population decreased approximately twofold. These results provide observational evidence that vaccination not only protects individuals who have been vaccinated but also provides cross-protection to unvaccinated individuals in the community.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1038/s41591-021-01407-5,COVID-19/*prevention & control/virology;COVID-19 Vaccines/*immunology;Humans;SARS-CoV-2/*immunology;Vaccination,34113015,

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) between 15 January 2022 and 15 February 2022 across 9 hospitals in a large health network. Data were extracted by manual records review. RESULTS: A total of 351 of 452 (77.7%) unvaccinated, 209 of 331 (63.1%) fully vaccinated, and 107 of 163 (65.6%) boosted patients hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis were determined to be admitted specifically due to COVID-19 (P < .001). Most (85%) boosted patients admitted due to COVID-19 were at least 65 years old and/or had severe immunosuppression, compared to 72.2% of fully vaccinated and 60.7% of unvaccinated patients (P < .001). Significantly more unvaccinated patients (34.2%) required >6 L/minute of supplemental oxygen compared to fully vaccinated (24.4%) and boosted (25.2%) patients (P = .027). The age-adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization due to COVID-19 was estimated to be 81.1% and 94.1% for full vaccination and boosted status, respectively, whereas VE against mortality related to COVID-19 was estimated to be 84.7% and 94.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: During the Omicron BA.1 sublineage wave, unvaccinated patients hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis were more likely than vaccinated patients to be admitted specifically due to COVID-19. Despite being younger with fewer comorbidities, unvaccinated patients required higher levels of care.

METHODS: In this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we analysed data from 115,775 CA aged 12-17 years, proxy-reported through the Covid Symptom Study (CSS) smartphone application. We calculated post-vaccination infection risk after one dose of BNT162b2, and described the illness profile of CA with post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to unvaccinated CA, and post-vaccination side-effects. FINDINGS: Between August 5, 2021 and February 14, 2022, 25,971 UK CA aged 12-17 years received one dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. The probability of testing positive for infection diverged soon after vaccination, and was lower in CA with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination reduced proxy-reported infection risk (-80·4% (95% CI -0·82 -0·78) and -53·7% (95% CI -0·62 -0·43) at 14-30 days with Delta and Omicron variants respectively, and -61·5% (95% CI -0·74 -0·44) and -63·7% (95% CI -0·68 -0.59) after 61-90 days). Vaccinated CA who contracted SARS-CoV-2 during the Delta period had milder disease than unvaccinated CA; during the Omicron period this was only evident in children aged 12-15 years. Overall disease profile was similar in both vaccinated and unvaccinated CA. Post-vaccination local side-effects were common, systemic side-effects were uncommon, and both resolved within few days (3 days in most cases). INTERPRETATION: One dose of BNT162b2 vaccine reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for at least 90 days in CA aged 12-17 years. Vaccine protection varied for SARS-CoV-2 variant type (lower for Omicron than Delta variant), and was enhanced by pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severity of COVID-19 presentation after vaccination was generally milder, although unvaccinated CA also had generally mild disease. Overall, vaccination was well-tolerated.

The aim of this study was to estimate the effectiveness of mRNA-based vaccine boosters (third dose) against infection with the omicron variant by age, sex, time since complete vaccination, type of primary vaccine, and type of booster. METHODS: In this nationwide cohort study, we linked data from three nationwide population registries in Spain (Vaccination Registry, Laboratory Results Registry, and National Health System registry) to select community-dwelling individuals aged 40 years or older, who completed their primary vaccine schedule at least 3 months before the start of follow-up, and had not tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 since the start of the pandemic. On each day between Jan 3, and Feb 6, 2022, we matched individuals who received a booster mRNA vaccine and controls of the same sex, age group, postal code, type of vaccine, time since primary vaccination, and number of previous tests. We estimated risk of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared groups using risk ratios (RR) and risk differences. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as one minus RR. FINDINGS: Between Jan 3, and Feb 6, 2022, 3 111 159 matched pairs were included in our study. Overall, the estimated effectiveness from day 7 to 34 after a booster was 51·3% (95% CI 50·2-52·4). Estimated effectiveness was 52·5% (51·3-53·7) for an mRNA-1273 booster and 46·2% (43·5-48·7) for a BNT162b2 booster. Effectiveness was 58·6% (55·5-61·6) if primary vaccination had been with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca), 55·3% (52·3-58·2) with mRNA-1273 (Moderna), 49·7% (48·3-51·1) with BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), and 48·0% (42·5-53·7) with Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen). Estimated effectiveness was 43·6% (40·0-47·1) when the booster was administered between 151 days and 180 days after complete vaccination and 52·2% (51·0-53·3) if administered more than 180 days after primary scheduled completion. INTERPRETATION: Booster mRNA vaccine-doses were moderately effective in preventing infection with the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 for over a month after administration, which indicates their suitability as a strategy to limit the health effects of COVID-19 in periods of omicron variant domination. Estimated effectiveness was higher for mRNA-1273 compared with BNT162b2 and increased with time between completed primary vaccination and booster.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The US Department of Veterans Affairs has 130 medical centres. We created multivariate models from these data-339 772 patients with COVID-19-as of 30 September 2021. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome for all models was death within 60 days of the diagnosis. Logistic regression was used to derive adjusted ORs for vaccination and infection with Delta versus earlier variants. Models were adjusted for confounding factors, including demographics, comorbidity indices and novel parameters representing prior diagnoses, vital signs/baseline laboratory tests and outpatient treatments. Patients with a Delta infection were divided into eight cohorts based on the time from vaccination to diagnosis. A common model was used to estimate the odds of death associated with vaccination for each cohort relative to that of unvaccinated patients. RESULTS: 9.1% of subjects were vaccinated. 21.5% had the Delta variant. 18 120 patients (5.33%) died within 60 days of their diagnoses. The adjusted OR for a Delta infection was 1.87±0.05, which corresponds to a relative risk (RR) of 1.78. The overall adjusted OR for prior vaccination was 0.280±0.011 corresponding to an RR of 0.291. Raw CFR rose steadily after 10-14 weeks. The OR for vaccination remained stable for 10-34 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Our CFR model controls for the severity of confounding factors and priority of vaccination, rather than solely using the presence of comorbidities. Our results confirm that Delta was more lethal than earlier variants and that vaccination is an effective means of preventing death. After adjusting for major selection biases, we found no evidence that the benefits of vaccination on CFR declined over 34 weeks. We suggest that this model can be used to evaluate vaccines designed for emerging variants.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1136/bmjopen-2022-064135,Humans;*Veterans;*COVID-19/prevention & control;SARS-CoV-2;Vaccination;*Hepatitis D;Veterans,36564105,PMC9791110

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Symptomatic HCWs were routinely tested by RT-PCR as per institutional policy. Vaccination was offered to all HCWs in late January, and the details were documented. We set up a non-concurrent cohort to document infection rates and estimated protective efficacy of prior infection and vaccination between 16th Apr to 31st May 2021, using a Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying covariates adjusting for daily incidence. Between June 2020 and May 2021, 2735 (23.9%) of 11,405 HCWs were infected, with 1412, including 32 re-infections, reported during the second wave. 6863 HCWs received two doses of vaccine and 1905 one dose. The protective efficacy of prior infection against symptomatic infection was 86.0% (95% CI 76.7%-91.6%). Vaccination combined with prior infection provided 91.1% (95% CI 84.1%-94.9%) efficacy. In the absence of prior infection, vaccine efficacy against symptomatic infection during the second wave was 31.8% (95% CI 23.5%- 39.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Prior infection provided substantial protection against symptomatic re-infection and severe disease during a delta variant driven second wave in a cohort of health care workers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1371/journal.pone.0268797,*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines/therapeutic use;Health Personnel;Humans;Reinfection;SARS-CoV-2;Vaccination;India;Vaccines,35594270,PMC9122209

Pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies have been tried to lessen the mortality and morbidity burden. Various vaccines have been approved. The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan gave emergency approval for Sinopharm (BBIBP-CorV) COVID-19 vaccine in December 2021. The phase 3 trial of BBIBP-CorV included only 612 participants aged 60 years and above. The primary aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of BBIBPP-CorV (Sinopharm) vaccine within the Pakistani adult population aged 60 or above. The study was carried out in the Faisalabad district of Pakistan. METHODS: A test negative case-control study design was used to assess safety and efficacy of BBIBP-CorV in individuals aged 60 and above against symptomatic infection, hospitalisations and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. ORs were calculated using logistic regression model at 95% CI. ORs were used to calculate the vaccine efficacy (VE) by using the following formula.VE= (1-OR) ×100. RESULTS: 3426 individuals with symptoms of COVID-19 were PCR tested between 5 May 2021 and 31 July 2021. The results showed that Sinopharm vaccine 14 days after the second dose was efficient in reducing the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 infection, hospitalisations and mortality by 94.3%, 60.5% and 98.6%, respectively, among vaccinated individuals with a significant p value of 0.001.

In Singapore, quarantine of all close contacts, including entry and exit PCR testing, provided the opportunity to determine risk of infection by the Delta variant compared to other variants, vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, symptomatic or severe COVID-19, and risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and symptomatic disease. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included all close contacts between September 1, 2020 and May 31, 2021. Regardless of symptoms, all were quarantined for 14 days with entry and exit PCR testing. Household contacts were defined as individuals who shared a residence with a Covid-19 index case. Secondary attack rates among household close contacts of Delta variant-infected indexes and other variant-infected indexes were derived from prevalence of diagnosed cases among contacts. Relative risk ratios and bootstrapping at the cluster level was used to determine risk of infection by the Delta variant compared to other variants and vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, symptomatic or severe COVID-19. Logistic regression using generalized estimating equations was used to determine risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and symptomatic disease. FINDINGS: Of 1024 household contacts linked to 301 PCR-confirmed index cases, 753 (73.5%) were linked to Delta-infected indexes and 248 (24.2%) were exposed to indexes with other variants. Household secondary attack rate among unvaccinated Delta-exposed contacts was 25.8% (95% boostrap confidence interval [BCI] 20.6-31.5%) compared with 12.9% (95%BCI 7.0-20.0%) among other variant-exposed contacts. Unvaccinated Delta-exposed contacts were more likely to be infected than those exposed to other variants (Relative risk 2.01, 95%CI 1.24-3.84). Among Delta-exposed contacts, complete vaccination had a vaccine effectiveness of 56.4% (95%BCI 32.6-75.8%) against acquisition, 64.1% (95%BCI 37.8-85.4%) against symptomatic disease and 100% against severe disease. Among Delta-exposed contacts, vaccination status (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.33, 95% robust confidence interval [RCI] 0.17-0.63) and older age of the index (aOR 1.20 per decade, 95%RCI 1.03-1.39) was associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition by the contact. Vaccination status of the index was not associated with a statistically-significant difference for contact SARS-CoV-2 acquisition (aOR 0.73, 95%RCI 0.38-1.40). INTERPRETATION: Increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 Delta acquisition compared with other variants was reduced with vaccination.

OBJECTIVE: To determine levels of protection against severe COVID-19 and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by types and combinations of vaccine boosters in Singapore during the Omicron wave. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included Singapore residents aged 30 years or more vaccinated with either at least 2 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (ie, Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 or Moderna mRNA-1273) or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (Sinovac CoronaVac or Sinopharm BBIBP-CorV) as of March 10, 2022. Individuals with a known SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to December 27, 2021, an infection on or before the date of their second vaccine dose, or with reinfection cases were excluded. EXPOSURES: Two or 3 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2, Moderna mRNA-1273, Sinovac CoronaVac, or Sinopharm BBIBP-CorV. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Notified infections from December 27, 2021, to March 10, 2022, adjusted for age, sex, race, housing status, and calendar days. Estimated booster effectiveness, defined as the relative incidence-rate reduction of severe disease (supplemental oxygen, intensive care, or death) or confirmed infection following 3-dose vaccination compared with 5 months after second mRNA dose, was determined using binomial regression. RESULTS: Among 2 441 581 eligible individuals (1 279 047 [52.4%] women, 846 110 (34.7%) aged 60 years and older), there were 319 943 (13.1%) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, of which 1513 (0.4%) were severe COVID-19 cases. mRNA booster effectiveness against confirmed infection 15 to 60 days after boosting was estimated to range from 31.7% to 41.3% for the 4 boosting combinations (homologous BNT162b2, homologous mRNA-1273, 2-dose BNT162b2/mRNA-1273 booster, and 2-dose mRNA-1273/BNT162b2 booster). Five months and more after boosting, estimated booster effectiveness against confirmed infection waned, ranging from -2.8% to 14.6%. Against severe COVID-19, estimated mRNA booster effectiveness was 87.4% (95% CI, 83.3%-90.5%) 15 to 60 days after boosting and 87.2% (95% CI, 84.2%-89.7%) 5 to 6 months after boosting, with no significant difference comparing vaccine combinations. Booster effectiveness against severe COVID-19 15 days to 330 days after 3-dose inactivated COVID-19 vaccination, regardless of combination, was estimated to be 69.6% (95% CI, 48.7%-81.9%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Booster mRNA vaccine protection against severe COVID-19 was estimated to be durable over 6 months.

A key reason for this recommendation is the expectation that a booster vaccine dose can alleviate observed waning of vaccine effectiveness (VE). Although initial reports of booster effectiveness have been positive, the level of protection from booster vaccination is unclear. We conducted two studies to assess the impact of booster vaccination, with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection between August and December 2021. We first compared SARS-CoV-2 infection incidence in cohorts of 3-dose vaccine recipients to incidence in matched cohorts of 2-dose vaccine recipients (cohort size = 24,539 for BNT162b2 and 14,004 for mRNA-1273). Additionally, we applied a test-negative study design to compare the level of protection against symptomatic infection in 3-dose recipients to that observed in recent 2-dose primary vaccine series recipients. The 3-dose recipients experienced a significantly lower incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection than the matched 2-dose cohorts (BNT162b2 Incidence Rate Ratio: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.13 and mRNA-1273 IRR: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.15). Results from the test-negative study showed the third vaccine dose mitigated waning of VE, with the risk of symptomatic infection in 3-dose recipients being comparable to that observed 7 to 73 days after the primary vaccine series. These results show that 3-dose vaccine regimens with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 are effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection and support the widespread administration of booster vaccine doses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac042,"RNA, Messenger;Vaccination;Vaccines",36713312,PMC9802350

The proposed design has an advantage in its applicability drawing from the routine data monitoring system. Future studies that exercise other designs, such as test-negative and cohort studies, are recommended in order to compare and contrast the findings across different designs.

METHODS: From individuals vaccinated with two doses against Covid-19 in Sweden until July 5, 2021 (N=3,445,061), we formed a study cohort including 94,569 individuals that had received heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 / BNT162b2 prime-boost vaccination, 16,402 individuals that received heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 / mRNA-1273 prime-boost vaccination, and 430,100 individuals that received homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 / ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost vaccination. In addition, 180,716 individuals were selected who were unvaccinated at the date of vaccination in the corresponding case. Unvaccinated individuals were censored at first dose of any vaccine. Baseline was the date of the second dose of any vaccine, with the same date in the corresponding unvaccinated individual. The outcome included incident symptomatic Covid-19 infection occurring >14 days after baseline. FINDINGS: During a mean follow-up time of 76 (range 1-183) days, symptomatic Covid-19 infection was confirmed in 187 individuals with heterologous vaccine schedules (incidence rate: 2.0/100,000 person-days) and in 306 individuals from the unvaccinated control group (incidence rate: 7.1/100,000 person-days). The adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 67% (95% CI, 59-73, P<0.001) for heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 / BNT162b2 prime-boost vaccination, and 79% (95% CI, 62-88, P<0.001) for heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 / mRNA-1273 prime-boost vaccination. When combined and analysed together, the two heterologous vaccine schedules had an effectiveness of 68% (95% CI, 61-74, P<0.001) which was significantly greater (P(interaction)<0.001) than the 50% effectiveness for homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 / ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (95% CI, 41-58, P<0.001). INTERPRETATION: The findings of this study suggest that the use of heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and mRNA prime-boost vaccination is an effective alternative to increase population immunity against Covid-19, including against the Delta variant which dominated the confirmed cases during the study period.

We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination against the risk of infection, hospitalisation, and death during the first 9 months after vaccination for the total population of Sweden. METHODS: This retrospective, total population cohort study was done using data from Swedish nationwide registers. The cohort comprised all individuals vaccinated with two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, mRNA-1273, or BNT162b2, and matched unvaccinated individuals, with data on vaccinations and infections updated until Oct 4, 2021. Two outcomes were evaluated. The first was SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity from Jan 12 to Oct 4, 2021. The second was severe COVID-19, defined as hospitalisation for COVID-19 or all-cause 30-day mortality after confirmed infection, from March 15 to Sept 28, 2021. FINDINGS: Between Dec 28, 2020, and Oct 4, 2021, 842 974 individuals were fully vaccinated (two doses), and were matched (1:1) to an equal number of unvaccinated individuals (total study cohort n=1 685 948). For the outcome SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity, the vaccine effectiveness of BNT162b2 waned progressively over time, from 92% (95% CI 92 to 93; p<0·001) at 15-30 days, to 47% (39 to 55; p<0·001) at 121-180 days, and to 23% (-2 to 41; p=0·07) from day 211 onwards. Waning was slightly slower for mRNA-1273, with a vaccine effectiveness of 96% (94 to 97; p<0·001) at 15-30 days and 59% (18 to 79; p=0·012) from day 181 onwards. Waning was also slightly slower for heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 plus an mRNA vaccine, for which vaccine effectiveness was 89% (79 to 94; p<0·001) at 15-30 days and 66% (41 to 80; p<0·001) from day 121 onwards. By contrast, vaccine effectiveness for homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was 68% (52 to 79; p<0·001) at 15-30 days, with no detectable effectiveness from day 121 onwards (-19% [-98 to 28]; p=0·49). For the outcome of severe COVID-19, vaccine effectiveness waned from 89% (82 to 93; p<0·001) at 15-30 days to 64% (44 to 77; p<0·001) from day 121 onwards. Overall, there was some evidence for lower vaccine effectiveness in men than in women and in older individuals than in younger individuals. INTERPRETATION: We found progressively waning vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity across all subgroups, but the rate of waning differed according to vaccine type. With respect to severe COVID-19, vaccine effectiveness seemed to be better maintained, although some waning became evident after 4 months. The results strengthen the evidence-based rationale for administration of a third vaccine dose as a booster.

METHODS: Two matched cohorts were formed using Swedish nationwide registers. In the first, residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) given a fourth dose of an mRNA vaccine from 1 January 2022 onwards were matched 1:1 on birth year and county of residence to residents given at least a third dose (N = 24,524). In the second, all individuals aged ≥80 years given a fourth dose were matched 1:1 to individuals given at least a third dose (N = 394,104). Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in fourth-dose recipients as compared with in third-dose recipients, with relative vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimated as 1 minus the hazard ratio. FINDINGS: From 7 days after baseline and onwards, there were 1119 deaths in the LTCF cohort during a median follow-up of 77 days and a maximum follow-up of 126 days. During days 7 to 60, the VE of the fourth dose was 39% (95% CI, 29-48), which declined to 27% (95% CI, -2-48) during days 61 to 126. In the cohort of all individuals aged ≥80 years, there were 5753 deaths during a median follow-up of 73 days and a maximum follow-up of 143 days. During days 7 to 60, the VE of the fourth dose was 71% (95% CI, 69-72), which declined to 54% (95% CI, 48-60) during days 61 to 143. The VE of the fourth dose seemed stronger when it was compared to third-dose recipients where at least four months had passed since vaccination (P < 0·001 for interaction). INTERPRETATION: As compared with a third dose, a fourth dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, administered during the Omicron era, was associated with reduced risk of death from all causes in residents of LTCFs and in the oldest old during the first two months, after which the protection became slightly lower. These findings suggest that a fourth dose may prevent premature mortality in the oldest and frailest even after the emergence of the Omicron variant, although the timing of vaccination seems to be important with respect to the slight waning observed after two months.

We aimed to estimate the incidence of MIS-C, and describe the clinical phenotype, following the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2 and sublineages) according to vaccination status. We aimed to compare the incidence and clinical phenotype of MIS-C from our cohort during the pre-delta era. METHODS: This prospective, population-based cohort study included patients aged 0-17 years hospitalised with MIS-C in Denmark, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition, from Aug 1, 2021, to Feb 1, 2022, a period dominated by the delta variant. We identified MIS-C cases via a nationwide research collaboration involving real-time data collection from all 18 paediatric departments. Aggregated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections by vaccination status was obtained from the Danish COVID-19 surveillance registries. The incidence of MIS-C was calculated using the estimated number of infected individuals by vaccination status. We calculated the incidence of MIS-C per 1 000 000 vaccinated and unvaccinated person-years, and estimated vaccine effectiveness as 1-incidence rate ratio using Poisson regression. Incidence and phenotype of MIS-C were compared with MIS-C cases from the first year of the pandemic. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05186597. FINDINGS: We identified 51 MIS-C cases among unvaccinated individuals and one in a fully vaccinated adolescent. The incidence of MIS-C was one in 3400 unvaccinated individuals (95% CI 2600-4600) with the delta variant and one in 9900 vaccinated individuals (95% CI 1800-390 000) with breakthrough infection. The estimated vaccine effectiveness against MIS-C after the delta variant was 94% (95% CI 55-99; p=0·0061) in individuals aged 5-17 years. The clinical phenotype during the delta wave was comparable to the pre-delta era. INTERPRETATION: We found the incidence and phenotype of MIS-C in unvaccinated children during the delta wave to be similar to the incidence during the first year of the pandemic. We found vaccine effectiveness to be high against MIS-C, which we suggest was due to protection from infection and, possibly, a decreased incidence of MIS-C after breakthrough infection. Knowledge of the incidence of MIS-C after different SARS-CoV-2 variants and the effect of vaccination might contribute to the elucidation of the extent to which MIS-C is a vaccine-preventable disease.

Little is known about the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine in adolescents in the general population, as opposed to a clinical trial population. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a matched case-control study among adolescents (aged 12-18 years) who had results from a SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Immunization histories, relevant clinical data, and RT-PCR test results were obtained from the Yale New Haven Health System's medical records between June 1, 2021, and August 15, 2021, when the Delta variant caused 92% of infections in Connecticut. Case participants were defined as adolescents who had a positive test result and an associated medical encounter. Control participants were defined as those who had a negative test result and were matched to a case participant by age, county of residence, and date of testing. EXPOSURES: Adolescents were defined as fully immunized if they had received 2 doses of vaccine at least 14 days before focal time. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measured was SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. The vaccine's effectiveness (VE) was estimated using matched odds ratios from conditional logistic regression models. Secondary measures included estimated VE by clinical symptoms, number of vaccine doses received, and elapsed time from immunization. RESULTS: A total of 6901 adolescents were tested for SARS-CoV-2. The final sample comprised 186 case participants and 356 matched control participants. The median age was 14 (IQR, 13-16) years, 262 (48%) identified as female, 81 (15%) as Black, 82 (15%) as Hispanic, and 297 (55%) as White. Overall, 134 (25%) were fully immunized (case participants, 10 [5%]; control participants, 124 [35%]). The median time between immunization and the SARS-CoV-2 test was 62 days (range, 17-129 days). Within 4 months of receiving 2 doses, VE against any infection was estimated to be 91% (95% CI, 80%-96%); against asymptomatic infection, 85% (95% CI, 57%-95%). Effectiveness after a single dose was estimated to be 74% (95% CI, 18%-92%).

STUDY DESIGN: A test-negative, case-control analysis was conducted in Brazil from July 2021 to March 2022. We enrolled 8,458 eligible individuals (12 - 19 years of age) hospitalized with an acute respiratory syndrome, including 3,075 cases with laboratory-proven COVID-19 and 4,753 controls with negative tests for COVID-19. The primary exposure of interest was vaccination status. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection during gamma/delta vs. omicron-predominant periods. The adjusted odds ratio for the association of prior vaccination and outcomes was used to estimate VE. RESULTS: In the pre-omicron period, VE against COVID-19 hospitalization was 88% (95%CI, 83% to 92%) and has dropped to 59% (95%CI, 49% to 66%) during the omicron period. For hospitalized cases of COVID-19, considering the entire period of the analysis, 2-dose schedule was moderately effective against ICU admission (46%, [95%CI, 27 to 60]), need of mechanical ventilation (49%, [95%CI, 32 to 70]), severe COVID-19 (42%, [95%CI, 17 to 60]), and death (46%, [95%CI, 8 to 67]). There was a substantial reduction of about 40% in the VE against all endpoints, except for death, during the omicron-predominant period. Among cases, 240 (6.6%) adolescents died; of fatal cases, 224 (93.3%) were not fully vaccinated. CONCLUSION: Among adolescents, the VE against all endpoints was substantially reduced during the omicron-predominant period. Our findings suggest that the two-dose regimen may be insufficient for SARS-CoV-2 variants and support the need for updated vaccines to provide better protection against severe COVID-19.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1016/j.jpeds.2022.09.039,Case-Control Studies;Vaccination;Adolescent;Vaccines,36181868,PMC9519371

Receipt of vaccine, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and related severe outcomes (hospitalization or death) were determined from provincial health administrative data. Receipt of one and two doses of vaccine were modeled in a time-varying cause-specific Cox proportional hazards model, adjusting for baseline characteristics, background community infection rates, and censoring for non-COVID death, recovered kidney function, transfer out of province, solid organ transplant, and withdrawal from dialysis. RESULTS: Among 13,759 individuals receiving maintenance dialysis, 2403 (17%) were unvaccinated and 11,356 (83%) had received at least one dose by June 30, 2021.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective cohort study using Columbia University Irving Medical Center data linked to state and city immunisation registries. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We used large-scale propensity score matching with up to 54 987 covariates, fitted Cox proportional hazards models and constructed Kaplan-Meier plots for two main outcomes (COVID-19 infection and COVID-19-associated hospitalisation). We conducted manual chart review of cases in week 1 in both groups along with a set of secondary analyses for other index date, outcome and population choices. RESULTS: The study included 179 666 patients. We observed increasing effectiveness after the first dose of mRNA vaccines with week 6 effectiveness approximating 84% (95% CI 72% to 91%) for COVID-19 infection and 86% (95% CI 69% to 95%) for COVID-19-associated hospitalisation. When analysing unexpectedly high effectiveness in week 1, chart review revealed that vaccinated patients are less likely to seek care after vaccination and are more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 during the encounters for other conditions. Secondary analyses highlighted potential outcome misclassification for International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis, the influence of excluding patients with prior COVID-19 infection and anchoring in the unexposed group. Long-term vaccine effectiveness in fully vaccinated patients matched the results of the randomised trials. CONCLUSIONS: For vaccine effectiveness studies, observational data need to be scrutinised to ensure compared groups exhibit similar health-seeking behaviour and are equally likely to be captured in the data. While we found that studies may be capable of accurately estimating long-term effectiveness despite bias in early weeks, the early week results should be reported in every study so that we may gain a better understanding of the biases.

We sought to identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 infection and the role of vaccination in order to develop management guidelines relevant to our patients. METHODS: A total of 621 patients from our registry that included 297 MS and 324 non MS disorders (Aquaporin- 4 antibody positive [50], Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody positive [81], seronegative [162] and clinically isolated syndrome [31]) were contacted. COVID-19 infection and vaccination status were queried. Patients who self reported COVID-19 infection based on a positive RT PCR report were compared with non infected patients to identify factors associated with susceptibility for COVID-19 infection. Univariate and multivariate analysis of potential risk factors included demographic and clinical features, body mass index (BMI), presence of comorbidities, absolute lymphocyte count, treatment types and vaccination status. RESULTS: Sixty seven patients with MS and 27 with non MS disorders developed COVID-19 infection. Among them 81 patients had mild infection and remained quarantined at home. All 13 patients who needed hospitalization recovered. Vaccination status was known in 582 patients among whom 69.8% had completed or taken one dose of vaccine at the time of inquiry. Majority of treated patients (61.3%) were on nonspecific immunosuppressants. In univariate analysis, presence of ≥1 comorbidity was significantly associated with COVID-19 infection in both MS (p value 0.01, OR-2.28, 95%CI- 1.18-4.4) and non MS patients (p- 0.001, OR-4.4, 95% CI-1.88-10.24). In the latter, BMI ≥ 30 (p-0.04, OR-3.27, 95% CI- 0.98-10.87) and EDSS score ≥ 3 (p-0.02, OR- 2.59,95% CI- 1.08-6.23) were other significant associations. History of prior COVID-19 vaccination was associated with reduced frequency of COVID-19 infection among MS (p- 0.001,OR- 0.24,95% CI- 0.13-0.43) and non MS patients (p- 0.0001,OR-0.14, 95% CI- 0.058-0.35). In multivariate analysis presence of comorbidities significantly increased and prior vaccination significantly reduced frequency of COVID-19 infection for both MS and related disorders. Concurrent disease modifying treatments showed a trend for association with infection. In the unvaccinated group, patients on disease modifying treatment were significantly at risk of infection, 81.5% unvaccinated and treated versus 18.5% who were unvaccinated and untreated (p- 0.0001, OR-10.1, 95% CI-0.56-2.11). CONCLUSION: Frequency and severity of COVID-19 infection was low among our patient cohort. Higher rate of infection in the treated group was significantly seen among unvaccinated patients.

METHODS: After linking demographic and mortality data for cases with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 2020 and January 2021 in England, a random sample of 6000 persons who died and 36 000 who did not die within 28 days of a positive test was obtained from the dataset of 3 020 800 patients. Based on an address-matching process, the residence type of each case was categorised into one of private home and residential or nursing LTCF. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Multivariable analysis showed that an interaction effect between age and residence type determined the outcome. Compared with a 60-year-old person not living in LTCF, the adjusted OR (aOR) for same-aged persons living in residential and nursing LTCFs was 1.77 (95% CI 1.21 to 2.6, p=0.0017) and 3.95 (95% CI 2.77 to 5.64, p<0.0001), respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the initial short-term additional benefit of a 3-dose vs a 2-dose regimen against infection of SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This preliminary retrospective case-control study used 2 complementary approaches: a test-negative design and a matched case-control design. Participants were included from the national centralized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services, an Israeli healthcare maintenance organization covering 2.5 million members. Data were collected between March 1, 2020, and October 4, 2021, and analyses focused on the period from August 1, 2021, to October 4, 2021, because the booster dose was widely administered from August 1 onward. EXPOSURES: Either 2 doses or 3 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The reduction in the odds of a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at different time intervals following receipt of the booster dose (0-6, 7-13, 14-20, 21-27, and 28-65 days) compared with receiving only 2 doses. RESULTS: The study population included 306 710 members of Maccabi Healthcare Services who were 40 years and older (55% female) and received either 2 or 3 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine and did not have a positive PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2 prior to the start of the follow-up period. During this period, there were 500 232 PCR tests performed, 227 380 among those who received 2 doses and 272 852 among those who received 3 doses, with 14 989 (6.6%) and 4941 (1.8%) positive test results in each group, respectively. Comparing those who received a booster and those who received 2 doses, there was an estimated odds ratio of 0.14 (95% CI, 0.13-0.15) 28 to 65 days following receipt of the booster (86% reduction in the odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Previous studies have demonstrated that vaccine-derived protection against SARS-CoV-2 wanes over time. In this case-control analysis, we showed an association between receipt of the booster dose and a reduction in the odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, potentially counteracting waning immunity in the short term. Further monitoring of data from this population is needed to determine the duration of immunity following the booster.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.7382,"Adult;BNT162 Vaccine/*therapeutic use;COVID-19/*diagnosis/*prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines/*therapeutic use;Case-Control Studies;Comparative Effectiveness Research;Female;Humans;Incidence;Male;Retrospective Studies;SARS-CoV-2/*isolation & purification;Time Factors;RNA, Messenger;Vaccination;Vaccines",34846533,PMC8634151

We aimed to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) to prevent COVID-19 symptomatic cases, hospitalization, critical care admission, and deaths in a cohort of 796,072 insured subjects older than 40 years in northern Colombia, a setting with a high SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS: We identified individuals vaccinated between March 1st of 2021 and August 15th of 2021. We included symptomatic cases, hospitalizations, critical care admissions, and deaths in patients with confirmed COVID-19 as main outcomes. We calculated VE for each outcome from the hazard ratio in Cox proportionally hazards regressions (adjusted by age, sex, place of residence, diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus, cancer, hypertension, tuberculosis, neurological diseases, and chronic renal disease), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). FINDINGS: A total of 719,735 insured participants of 40 and more years were followed. We found 21,545 laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 among unvaccinated population, along with 2874 hospitalizations, 1061 critical care admissions, and 1329 deaths, for a rate of 207.2 per million person-days, 27.1 per million person-days, 10.0 per million person-days, and 12.5 per million person-days, respectively. We found CoronaVac was not effective for any outcome in subjects above 80 years old; but for people 40-79 years of age, we found two doses of CoronaVac reduced hospitalization (33.1%; 95% CI, 14.5-47.7), critical care admission (47.2%; 95% CI, 18.5-65.8), and death (55.7%; 95% CI, 32.5-70.0). We found BNT162b2 was effective for all outcomes in the entire population of subjects above 40 years of age, significantly declining for subjects ≥80 years. INTERPRETATION: Two doses of either CoronaVac in population between 40 and 79 years of age, or BNT162b2 among vaccinated above 40 years old significantly reduced deaths of confirmed COVID-19 in a cohort of individuals from Colombia. Vaccine effectiveness for CoronaVac and BNT162b2 declined with increasing age.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination and associations with SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical outcomes in a large population of adult OHT recipients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case-control study examined data from a US heart transplant program at a single center for all adult recipients of OHT who were followed up from January 15, 2021, through January 31, 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and related hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths between vaccinated vs unvaccinated adult recipients of OHT. RESULTS: A total of 436 patients who received OHT were included in the study, of which 106 patients were infected with COVID-19. The mean (SD) age was 54 (17) years; 303 (69.5%) were men and 133 (30.5%) were women. There were 366 patients in the vaccinated cohort with 72 COVID-19 infections (19.7%), 15 hospitalizations (4.1%), 4 ICU admissions (1.1%), and 3 deaths (0.8%). There were 70 patients in the unvaccinated cohort with 34 COVID-19 infections (48.6%), 10 hospitalizations (14.3%), 3 ICU admissions (4.3%), and 3 deaths (4.3%).

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended prioritization of HCP for COVID-19 vaccination to maintain provision of critical services and reduce spread of infection in health care settings (2). Early distribution of two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) to HCP allowed assessment of the effectiveness of these vaccines in a real-world setting. A test-negative case-control study is underway to evaluate mRNA COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic illness among HCP at 33 U.S. sites across 25 U.S. states. Interim analyses indicated that the VE of a single dose (measured 14 days after the first dose through 6 days after the second dose) was 82% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 74%-87%), adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions. The adjusted VE of 2 doses (measured ≥7 days after the second dose) was 94% (95% CI = 87%-97%). VE of partial (1-dose) and complete (2-dose) vaccination in this population is comparable to that reported from clinical trials and recent observational studies, supporting the effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines against symptomatic disease in adults, with strong 2-dose protection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.15585/mmwr.mm7020e2,Adult;Aged;COVID-19/epidemiology/*prevention & control;COVID-19 Testing;COVID-19 Vaccines/administration & dosage/*immunology;Case-Control Studies;Female;Health Personnel/*statistics & numerical data;Humans;Immunization Schedule;Male;Middle Aged;Occupational Diseases/epidemiology/*prevention & control;United States/epidemiology;Young Adult;Vaccination;Vaccines,34014909,PMC8136422

METHODS: We conducted a test-negative case-control study involving health care personnel across 25 U.S. states. Cases were defined on the basis of a positive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) or antigen-based test for SARS-CoV-2 and at least one Covid-19-like symptom. Controls were defined on the basis of a negative PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, regardless of symptoms, and were matched to cases according to the week of the test date and site. Using conditional logistic regression with adjustment for age, race and ethnic group, underlying conditions, and exposures to persons with Covid-19, we estimated vaccine effectiveness for partial vaccination (assessed 14 days after receipt of the first dose through 6 days after receipt of the second dose) and complete vaccination (assessed ≥7 days after receipt of the second dose). RESULTS: The study included 1482 case participants and 3449 control participants. Vaccine effectiveness for partial vaccination was 77.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.9 to 82.7) with the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) and 88.9% (95% CI, 78.7 to 94.2) with the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna); for complete vaccination, vaccine effectiveness was 88.8% (95% CI, 84.6 to 91.8) and 96.3% (95% CI, 91.3 to 98.4), respectively. Vaccine effectiveness was similar in subgroups defined according to age (<50 years or ≥50 years), race and ethnic group, presence of underlying conditions, and level of patient contact. Estimates of vaccine effectiveness were lower during weeks 9 through 14 than during weeks 3 through 8 after receipt of the second dose, but confidence intervals overlapped widely. CONCLUSIONS: The BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines were highly effective under real-world conditions in preventing symptomatic Covid-19 in health care personnel, including those at risk for severe Covid-19 and those in racial and ethnic groups that have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between receiving the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and COVID-19-related infections and hospitalizations before and during the Delta variant surge. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included adults aged 18 years and older who were newly Ad26.COV2.S-vaccinated matched to as many as 10 unvaccinated individuals by date, location, age, sex, and comorbidity index. This was followed by 1:4 propensity score matching on COVID-19 risk factors. Data were collected from US insurance claims data from March 1, 2020, through August 31, 2021. EXPOSURES: Vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S vs no vaccination. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated for recorded COVID-19 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization, nationwide and in subgroups by age, high-risk factors, calendar time, and states with high incidences of the Delta variant. VE estimates were corrected for underrecording of vaccinations in insurance data.

We aimed to estimate protection against symptomatic PCR-confirmed infection with the delta (B.1.617.2) and omicron (B.1.1.529) variants in adolescents with previous infection, mRNA vaccination, and hybrid immunity. METHODS: We conducted an observational, test-negative, case-control study using national SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-19 mRNA vaccination data in England. Symptomatic adolescents aged 12-17 years who were unvaccinated or had received primary BNT162b2 immunisation at symptom onset and had a community SARS-CoV-2 PCR test were included. Vaccination and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status in adolescents with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (cases) were compared with vaccination and previous infection status in adolescents who had a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test (controls). Vaccination data were collected from the National Immunisation Management System, and were linked to PCR testing data. The primary outcome was protection against SARS-CoV-2 delta and omicron infection (defined as 1 - odds of vaccination or previous infection in cases divided by odds of vaccination or previous infection in controls). FINDINGS: Between Aug 9, 2021, and March 31, 2022, 1 161 704 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were linked to COVID-19 vaccination status, including 390 467 positive tests with the delta variant and 212 433 positive tests with the omicron variants BA.1 and BA.2. In unvaccinated adolescents, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection with wildtype, alpha (B.1.1.7), or delta strains provided greater protection against subsequent delta infection (>86·1%) than against subsequent omicron infection (<52·4%); previous delta or omicron infection provided similar protection against omicron reinfection (52·4% [95% CI 50·9-53·8] vs 59·3% [46·7-69·0]). In adolescents with no previous infection, vaccination provided lower protection against omicron infection than against delta infection, with omicron protection peaking at 64·5% (95% CI 63·6-65·4) at 2-14 weeks after dose two and 62·9% (60·5-65·1) at 2-14 weeks after dose three, with waning protection after each dose. Adolescents with hybrid immunity from previous infection and vaccination had the highest protection, irrespective of the SARS-CoV-2 strain in the primary infection. The highest protection against omicron infection was observed in adolescents with vaccination and previous omicron infection, reaching 96·4% (95% CI 84·4-99·1) at 15-24 weeks after vaccine dose two. INTERPRETATION: Previous infection with any SARS-CoV-2 variant provided some protection against symptomatic reinfection, and vaccination added to this protection. Vaccination provides low-to-moderate protection against symptomatic omicron infection, with waning protection after each dose, while hybrid immunity provided the most robust protection. Although more data are needed to investigate longer-term protection and protection against infection with new variants, these data question the need for additional booster vaccine doses for adolescents in populations with already high protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We conducted a test-negative case-control study to assess the durability of protection after full vaccination with BNT162b2 against polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a national medical practice from January 2021 through January 2022. We fit conditional logistic regression (CLR) models stratified on residential county and calendar time of testing to assess the association between time elapsed since vaccination and the odds of symptomatic infection or non-COVID-19 hospitalization (negative control), adjusted for several covariates. There were 5,985 symptomatic individuals with a positive test after full vaccination with BNT162b2 (cases) and 32,728 negative tests contributed by 27,753 symptomatic individuals after full vaccination (controls). The adjusted odds of symptomatic infection were higher 250 days after full vaccination versus at the date of full vaccination (Odds Ratio [OR]: 3.62, 95% CI: 2.52 to 5.20). The odds of infection were still lower 285 days after the first BNT162b2 dose as compared to 4 days after the first dose (OR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.67), when immune protection approximates the unvaccinated status. Low rates of COVID-19 associated hospitalization or death in this cohort precluded analyses of these severe outcomes. The odds of non-COVID-19 associated hospitalization (negative control) decreased with time since vaccination, suggesting a possible underestimation of waning protection by this approach due to confounding factors. In summary, BNT162b2 strongly protected against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection for at least 8 months after full vaccination, but the degree of protection waned significantly over this period.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac082,Vaccination;Vaccines,35832867,PMC9272171

Controls were adults with only one infection episode in 2020 (i.e. not reinfected). Matching was performed by age, gender, and week of diagnosis for the first episode. The reinfection date of a case was applied to the matched controls for estimating full or partial vaccination status.

Prioritizing vaccine rollout, and achievement of herd immunity depend on SARS-CoV-2 transmission reduction. The vaccine's effect on infectivity is thus a critical priority. METHODS: Among all 9650 HCW of a large tertiary medical center in Israel, we calculated the prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR cases with asymptomatic presentation, tested following known or presumed exposure and the infectious subset (N-gene-Ct-value<30) of these. Additionally, infection incidence rates were calculated for symptomatic cases and infectious (Ct<30) cases. Vaccine effectiveness within three months of vaccine rollout was measured as one minus the relative risk or rate ratio, respectively. To further assess infectiousness, we compared the mean Ct-value and the proportion of infections with a positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen test of vaccinated vs. unvaccinated. The correlation between IgG levels within the week before detection and Ct level was assessed. FINDINGS: Reduced prevalence among fully vaccinated HCW was observed for (i) infections detected due to exposure, with asymptomatic presentation (VE(i)=65.1%, 95%CI 45-79%), (ii) the presumed infectious (Ct<30) subset of these (VE(ii)=69.6%, 95%CI 43-84%) (iii) never-symptomatic infections (VE(iii)=72.3%, 95%CI 48-86%), and (iv) the presumed infectious (Ct<30) subset (VE(iv)=83.0%, 95%CI 51-94%).Incidence of (v) symptomatic and (vi) symptomatic-infectious cases was significantly lower among fully vaccinated vs. unvaccinated individuals (VE(v)= 89.7%, 95%CI 84-94%, VE(vi)=88.1%, 95%CI 80-95%).The mean Ct-value was significantly higher in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated (27.3±1.2 vs. 22.2±1.0, p<0.001) and the proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests was also significantly lower among vaccinated vs. unvaccinated PCR-positive HCW (80% vs. 31%, p<0.001). Lower infectivity was correlated with higher IgG concentrations (R=0.36, p=0.01). INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that BNT162b2 is moderately to highly effective in reducing infectivity, via preventing infection and through reducing viral shedding.

Although CanSino is currently approved for use in 10 Latin American, Asian, and European countries, little information is available about its vaccine effectiveness (VE). METHODS: We evaluated CanSino VE within a childcare worker cohort that included 1408 childcare facilities. Participants were followed during March-December 2021 and tested through severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction or rapid antigen test if they developed any symptom compatible with COVID-19. Vaccination status was obtained through worker registries. VE was calculated as 100% × (1 - hazard ratio for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated vs unvaccinated participants), using an Andersen-Gill model adjusted for age, sex, state, and local viral circulation. RESULTS: The cohort included 43 925 persons who were mostly (96%) female with a median age of 32 years; 37 646 (86%) were vaccinated with CanSino. During March-December 2021, 2250 (5%) participants had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, of whom 25 were hospitalized and 6 died. Adjusted VE was 20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10%-29%) against illness, 76% (95% CI, 42%-90%) against hospitalization, and 94% (95% CI, 66%-99%) against death. VE against illness declined from 48% (95% CI, 33%-61%) after 14-60 days following full vaccination to 20% (95% CI, 9%-31%) after 61-120 days. CONCLUSIONS: CanSino vaccine was effective at preventing COVID-19 illness and highly effective at preventing hospitalization and death. It will be useful to further evaluate duration of protection and assess the value of booster doses to prevent COVID-19 and severe outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1093/cid/ciac488,Adult;*COVID-19/prevention & control;*COVID-19 Vaccines;Child;Child Care;Female;Humans;Male;Mexico/epidemiology;SARS-CoV-2;Vaccine Efficacy;Vaccination;Vaccines;Mexico,35717650,PMC9214173

We aimed to assess the relationship between immunosuppressive medications, mRNA vaccination, omicron infection, and severe COVID-19 outcomes (ie, hospitalisation, ICU admission, death). METHODS: We did a retrospective cohort study and included vaccinated and unvaccinated people aged 18 years or older in the Michigan Medicine health-care system, USA, during the omicron-dominant period of the pandemic (Dec 16, 2021-March 4, 2022). We collected data from electronic health records (demographics, diagnoses, medications) combined with immunisation data from the Michigan State Registry to determine vaccination status, and we collected COVID-19-related hospitalisation data by chart review. We used a Cox proportional hazards model based on calendar time to assess the effectiveness of the mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccines in people taking immunosuppressive medications (conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs [DMARDs], biologic DMARDs, or glucocorticoids within the past 3 months), while controlling for participant characteristics. Using the same model, we assessed the effect of different classes of medication such as immunosuppressive DMARDs, immunomodulatory DMARDs, and glucocorticoids on SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalisation due to COVID-19. All analyses were done using complete cases after removing participants with missing covariates. FINDINGS: 209 492 people were identified in Michigan Medicine, including 165 913 who were vaccinated and 43 579 who were unvaccinated. 41 078 people were excluded because they were younger than 18 years, partially vaccinated, had received a vaccine other than the two vaccines studied, or had incomplete covariate data. 168 414 people were included in the analysis; 97 935 (58%) were women, 70 479 (42%) were men, and 129 816 (77%) were White. 5609 (3%) people were taking immunosuppressive medications. In patients receiving immunosuppressants, three doses of BNT162b2 had a vaccine effectiveness of 50% (95% CI 31-64; p<0·0001) and three doses of mRNA-1273 had a vaccine effectiveness of 60% (42-73; p<0·0001) against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Three doses of either vaccine had an effectiveness of 87% (95% CI 73-93; p<0·0001) against hospitalisation due to COVID-19. Receipt of immunosuppressive DMARDs (hazard ratio 2·32, 95% CI 1·23-4·38; p=0·0097) or glucocorticoids (2·93, 1·77-4·86; p<0·0001) and a history of organ or bone marrow transplantation (3·52, 2·01-6·16; p<0·0001) were associated with increased risk of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 compared with those who had not received immunosuppressive medications or transplant. INTERPRETATION: People taking immunosuppressive DMARDs or glucocorticoids are at substantially higher risk of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 than the general population. However, the mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccines remain effective within this group, and it is important that patients taking these medications remain up to date with vaccinations to mitigate their risk.

We estimated BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness (VE) and a booster dose effectiveness in adolescents aged 12-17 years and the impact of opening schools and the Omicron variant on risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adolescents. METHODS: We used logistic regression with a test-negative design controlling for gender and race to estimate BNT162b2 VE and the effectiveness of a booster dose in adolescents aged 12-17 years. To evaluate the effect of school opening on Omicron transmission, we used Cox proportional hazards regression to compare adolescents to a reference group of adults aged 22-33 or aged 65+ years, investigating whether risk for adolescents increased relative to the reference group after school opened. RESULTS: We found that adolescents who received two BNT162b2 doses had significant protection against Omicron infection in the first three months following their second dose (VE = 54.5%, confidence interval [CI]: [17.8%-76.9%], p = .014) but no protection afterwards. Receiving a booster dose was associated with lower risk of infection (odds ratio = 0.48, CI: [0.33-0.69], p < .0001) and restored efficacy to a similar level (VE = 56.3%, CI: [36.5%-70.6%], p < .0001). We observed a statistically significant increase (p = .04) in adolescent infection risk relative to adults in the period of Omicron predominance. DISCUSSION: The BNT162b2 vaccine is effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in adolescents but immunity against Omicron wanes rapidly and booster doses are needed to retain protection.

We assessed the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of mRNA BNT162b2 (BioNTech-Pfizer) against SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant during an outbreak affecting long-term care facility (LTCF) residents in southern France, May 2021. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among LTCF residents. We described sex, age, dependency level, reverse transcription PCR and sequencing results, clinical evolution, vaccination status. We compared attack rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and severe COVID-19 (respiratory support, hospitalization, and/or death) by vaccination status (two doses administered vs. none) to estimate VE (1 - Relative Risk [RR]) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the estimated effectiveness of mRNA vaccination against medically attended COVID-19 among pregnant people during Delta and Omicron predominance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This test-negative, case-control study was conducted from June 2021 to June 2022 in a network of 306 hospitals and 164 emergency department and urgent care (ED/UC) facilities across 10 US states, including 4517 ED/UC encounters and 975 hospitalizations among pregnant people with COVID-19-like illness (CLI) who underwent SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing. EXPOSURES: Two doses (14-149 and ≥150 days prior) and 3 doses (7-119 and ≥120 days prior) of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (≥1 dose received during pregnancy) vs unvaccinated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Estimated VE against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated ED/UC encounter or hospitalization, based on the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for prior vaccination; VE was calculated as (1 - aOR) × 100%. RESULTS: Among 4517 eligible CLI-associated ED/UC encounters and 975 hospitalizations, 885 (19.6%) and 334 (34.3%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive, respectively; the median (IQR) patient age was 28 (24-32) years and 31 (26-35) years, 537 (12.0%) and 118 (12.0%) were non-Hispanic Black and 1189 (26.0%) and 240 (25.0%) were Hispanic. During Delta predominance, the estimated VE against COVID-19-associated ED/UC encounters was 84% (95% CI, 69% to 92%) for 2 doses within 14 to 149 days, 75% (95% CI, 5% to 93%) for 2 doses 150 or more days prior, and 81% (95% CI, 30% to 95%) for 3 doses 7 to 119 days prior; estimated VE against COVID-19-associated hospitalization was 99% (95% CI, 96% to 100%), 96% (95% CI, 86% to 99%), and 97% (95% CI, 79% to 100%), respectively. During Omicron predominance, for ED/UC encounters, the estimated VE of 2 doses within 14 to 149 days, 2 doses 150 or more days, 3 doses within 7 to 119 days, and 3 doses 120 or more days prior was 3% (95% CI, -49% to 37%), 42% (95% CI, -16% to 72%), 79% (95% CI, 59% to 89%), and -124% (95% CI, -414% to 2%), respectively; for hospitalization, estimated VE was 86% (95% CI, 41% to 97%), 64% (95% CI, -102% to 93%), 86% (95% CI, 28% to 97%), and -53% (95% CI, -1254% to 83%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, maternal mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, including booster dose, was associated with protection against medically attended COVID-19. VE estimates were higher against COVID-19-associated hospitalization than ED/UC visits and lower against the Omicron variant than the Delta variant. Protection waned over time, particularly during Omicron predominance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.33273,"Adult;*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines;Case-Control Studies;Female;Humans;*Influenza Vaccines;*Influenza, Human/prevention & control;Pregnancy;*Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/epidemiology/prevention & control;RNA, Messenger, Stored;SARS-CoV-2/genetics;United States/epidemiology;Vaccines, Synthetic;mRNA Vaccines;Vaccination;United States;RNA, Messenger",36156146,PMC9513651

We aimed to determine the association between COVID-19 vaccination and severe COVID-19 in the French overseas territories. METHODS: The French National Health Data System was used to conduct a 1:1 matched-cohort study. For each individual receiving a first dose of BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or Ad26.COV2-S vaccine between December 27, 2020, and July 31, 2021, one unvaccinated individual was randomly selected and matched for year of birth, sex, and overseas territories on the date of vaccination. We estimated vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-related hospitalization and in-hospital death after a full vaccination schedule, defined as ≥14 days after the second dose. Analyses were stratified according to the number of comorbidities. RESULTS: 276,778 vaccinated individuals had a double-dose vaccination during the follow-up period and were followed with their paired unvaccinated control. The average age was 50 years and 53% were women. During a median 77 days of follow-up from day 14 after the second injection, 96 COVID-19-related hospitalizations occurred among vaccinated individuals and 1,465 among their unvaccinated counterparts. Overall, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization was 94% (95%CI [93-95]) and exceeded 90% in each overseas territory, except Mayotte. The results were similar looking specifically at hospitalizations between July 15 and September 30, 2021. Vaccine effectiveness against in-hospital death was similar (94% [95%CI 91-96]). The risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization increased with the number of comorbidities, especially among vaccinated individuals. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In conclusion, vaccination has a major effect in reducing the risk of severe Covid-19 in the French overseas territories. The risk of COVID-19-hospitalization was very low among vaccinated individuals, especially in the absence of comorbidities. These results aim to increase confidence in vaccine effectiveness in overseas territories in hope of achieving better vaccination coverage.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1371/journal.pone.0274309,BNT162 Vaccine;*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines/therapeutic use;ChAdOx1 nCoV-19;Cohort Studies;Female;Hospital Mortality;Hospitalization;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;SARS-CoV-2;Vaccine Efficacy;Vaccination;Vaccines;Information Systems,36084113,PMC9462750

We aimed to investigate the severity of omicron and the extent to which booster vaccines are effective in preventing symptomatic infection. METHODS: In this study, using the Scotland-wide Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19 (EAVE II) platform, we did a cohort analysis with a nested test-negative design incident case-control study covering the period Nov 1-Dec 19, 2021, to provide initial estimates of omicron severity and the effectiveness of vaccine boosters against symptomatic disease relative to 25 weeks or more after the second vaccine dose. Primary care data derived from 940 general practices across Scotland were linked to laboratory data and hospital admission data. We compared outcomes between infection with the delta VOC (defined as S-gene positive) and the omicron VOC (defined as S-gene negative). We assessed effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, with infection confirmed through a positive RT-PCR. FINDINGS: By Dec 19, 2021, there were 23 840 S-gene-negative cases in Scotland, which were predominantly among those aged 20-39 years (11 732 [49·2%]). The proportion of S-gene-negative cases that were possible reinfections was more than ten times that of S-gene-positive cases (7·6% vs 0·7%; p<0·0001). There were 15 hospital admissions in S-gene-negative individuals, giving an adjusted observed-to-expected admissions ratio of 0·32 (95% CI 0·19-0·52). The booster vaccine dose was associated with a 57% (54-60) reduction in the risk of symptomatic S-gene-negative infection relative to individuals who tested positive 25 weeks or more after the second vaccine dose. INTERPRETATION: These early national data suggest that omicron is associated with a two-thirds reduction in the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation compared with delta. Although offering the greatest protection against delta, the booster dose of vaccination offers substantial additional protection against the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 for omicron compared with 25 weeks or more after the second vaccine dose.

We investigated the protective effect of the first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca non-replicating viral-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; AZD1222) and the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA-based vaccine (BNT162b2) in residents of long-term care facilities in terms of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection over time since vaccination. METHODS: The VIVALDI study is a prospective cohort study that commenced recruitment on June 11, 2020, to investigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission, infection outcomes, and immunity in residents and staff in long-term care facilities in England that provide residential or nursing care for adults aged 65 years and older. In this cohort study, we included long-term care facility residents undergoing routine asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 testing between Dec 8, 2020 (the date the vaccine was first deployed in a long-term care facility), and March 15, 2021, using national testing data linked within the COVID-19 Datastore. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we estimated the relative hazard of PCR-positive infection at 0-6 days, 7-13 days, 14-20 days, 21-27 days, 28-34 days, 35-48 days, and 49 days and beyond after vaccination, comparing unvaccinated and vaccinated person-time from the same cohort of residents, adjusting for age, sex, previous infection, local SARS-CoV-2 incidence, long-term care facility bed capacity, and clustering by long-term care facility. We also compared mean PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values for positive swabs obtained before and after vaccination. The study is registered with ISRCTN, number 14447421. FINDINGS: 10 412 care home residents aged 65 years and older from 310 LTCFs were included in this analysis. The median participant age was 86 years (IQR 80-91), 7247 (69·6%) of 10 412 residents were female, and 1155 residents (11·1%) had evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. 9160 (88·0%) residents received at least one vaccine dose, of whom 6138 (67·0%) received ChAdOx1 and 3022 (33·0%) received BNT162b2. Between Dec 8, 2020, and March 15, 2021, there were 36 352 PCR results in 670 628 person-days, and 1335 PCR-positive infections (713 in unvaccinated residents and 612 in vaccinated residents) were included. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for PCR-positive infection relative to unvaccinated residents declined from 28 days after the first vaccine dose to 0·44 (95% CI 0·24-0·81) at 28-34 days and 0·38 (0·19-0·77) at 35-48 days. Similar effect sizes were seen for ChAdOx1 (adjusted HR 0·32, 95% CI 0·15-0·66) and BNT162b2 (0·35, 0·17-0·71) vaccines at 35-48 days. Mean PCR Ct values were higher for infections that occurred at least 28 days after vaccination than for those occurring before vaccination (31·3 [SD 8·7] in 107 PCR-positive tests vs 26·6 [6·6] in 552 PCR-positive tests; p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Single-dose vaccination with BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines provides substantial protection against infection in older adults from 4-7 weeks after vaccination and might reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, the risk of infection is not eliminated, highlighting the ongoing need for non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent transmission in long-term care facilities.

We aimed to evaluate effectiveness of one, two, and three vaccine doses against infection and severe clinical outcomes in staff and residents of long-term care facilities in England over the first year following vaccine roll-out. METHODS: The VIVALDI study is a prospective cohort study done in 331 long-term care facilities in England. Residents aged 65 years or older and staff aged 18 years or older were eligible for participation. Participants had routine PCR testing throughout the study period between Dec 8, 2020, and Dec 11, 2021. We retrieved all PCR results and cycle threshold values for PCR-positive samples from routine testing in long-term care facilities, and positive PCR results from clinical testing in hospitals through the UK's COVID-19 Datastore. PCR results were linked to participants using pseudo-identifiers based on individuals' unique UK National Health Service (NHS) numbers, which were also used to retrieve vaccination records from the National Immunisation Management Service, hospitalisation records from NHS England, and deaths data from the Office for National Statistics through the COVID-19 Datastore. In a Cox proportional hazards regression, we estimated vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation, and COVID-19-related death after one, two, and three vaccine doses, separately by previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure. This study is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN 14447421. FINDINGS: 80 186 residents and staff of long-term care facilities had records available for the study period, of whom 15 518 eligible residents and 19 515 eligible staff were included in the analysis. For residents without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure, vaccine effectiveness decreased from 61·7% (95% CI 35·1 to 77·4) to 22·0% (-14·9 to 47·0) against infection; from 89·0% (70·6 to 95·9) to 56·3% (30·1 to 72·6) against hospitalisation; and from 96·4% (84·3 to 99·2) to 64·4% (36·1 to 80·1) against death, when comparing 14-83 days after dose two and 84 days or more after dose two. For staff without evidence of previous exposure, vaccine effectiveness against infection decreased slightly from 57·9% (43·1 to 68·9) at 14-83 days after dose two to 42·1% (29·9 to 52·2) at 84 days or more after dose two. There were no hospitalisations or deaths among unexposed staff at 14-83 days, but seven hospitalisations (vaccine effectiveness 91·0% [95% CI 74·3 to 96·8]) and one death were observed at 84 days or more after dose two. High vaccine effectiveness was restored following a third vaccine dose, with vaccine effectiveness in unexposed residents of 72·7% (55·8 to 83·1) against infection, 90·1% (80·6 to 95·0) against hospitalisation, and 97·5% (88·1 to 99·5) against death; and vaccine effectiveness in unexposed staff of 78·2% (70·0 to 84·1) against infection and 95·8% (49·9 to 99·6) against hospitalisation. There were no COVID-19-related deaths among unexposed staff after the third vaccine dose. INTERPRETATION: Our findings showed substantial waning of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectiveness against all outcomes in residents of long-term care facilities from 12 weeks after a primary course of ChAdOx1-S or mRNA vaccines. Boosters restored protection, and maximised immunity across all outcomes. These findings show the importance of boosting and the need for ongoing surveillance in this vulnerable cohort.

However, there is little evidence regarding other primary vaccine schedules such as BBIBP-CorV and ChAdOx1-S. We estimated the relative vaccine effectiveness (RVE) of the booster dose versus the primary regimens of COVID-19 vaccines based on BBIBP-CorV, ChAdOx1-S, or BNT162b2 for preventing death during the Omicron wave in Peruvian adult people. METHODS: We carried out a nested case-control study with a risk set sampling of controls using data from Peru between December 20, 2021, and February 20, 2022 (during the Omicron wave). Data on vaccination, COVID-19 tests and deaths were collected from national surveillance databases. We performed conditional logistic regression models to estimate the RVE on the adult population. In addition, we executed sub-group analysis per age group (18 to 59 years, and 60 years or more) and per primary regime (based on BNT162b2, BBIBP-CorV, or ChAdOx1-S). RESULTS: Of the 11,188,332 people eligible to enter the study 1,974 met the case definition (death from COVID-19) and were matched to 9,183 controls. The overall RVE of a third dose to prevent death was 87.2% (84.2%-89.7%), which varied according to the primary regime (87.3% for BNT162b2, 82.0% for BBIPB-CorV-2, and 79.5% for ChAdOx-S). In older adults, the RVE was 87.1%, without significant variations according to the primary regime (86.1% for BNT162b2, 86.1 for BBIBP-CorV, and 82% for ChAdOx-S). CONCLUSIONS: The booster) dose of vaccine against COVID-19 had a high RVE for preventing death by COVID-19 in the Peruvian population in all primary regimes of vaccines during the Omicron wave. This effect was consistent in people over 60 years of age, the group most vulnerable to die from this infection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: case-control",10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.09.066,"Humans;Middle Aged;Aged;Adolescent;Young Adult;Adult;COVID-19 Vaccines;BNT162 Vaccine;Peru/epidemiology;Case-Control Studies;*Influenza Vaccines;*COVID-19/prevention & control;Vaccine Efficacy;*Influenza, Human/prevention & control;Vaccination;Vaccines",36202642,PMC9515342

The adjusted VE for partial and full vaccination were estimated to be 52.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) 39.0-63.0%) and 83.0% (95% CI 73.0-89.0%) respectively for preventing SARS CoV-2 infection. The sub-group analyses of the cases have shown that the length of hospital stays (LOS) (partially vaccinated: 9 days vs. unvaccinated: 12 days; P = 0.028) and the severity of the disease (fully vaccinated: 30.3% vs. partially vaccinated: 51.3% and unvaccinated: 54.1%; P = 0.035) were significantly low among vaccinated compared to unvaccinated individuals. To conclude, four out of every five fully vaccinated individuals are estimated to be protected from contracting SARS CoV-2 infection. Vaccination lowered LOS and chances of development of severe disease.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: case-control",10.1017/S0950268821002247,COVID-19/epidemiology/pathology/*prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines/*therapeutic use;Case-Control Studies;Female;Humans;India/epidemiology;Male;Middle Aged;Severity of Illness Index;Treatment Outcome,34632972,PMC8545845

METHODS: Among adults 50-69 years old, single-dose messenger RNA (mRNA) and ChAdOx1 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization, including variant-specific, was assessed by test-negative design between 4 April and 2 October 2021. RESULTS: Single-dose VE included 11 861 cases and 99 544 controls. Median of postvaccination follow-up was 32 days (interquartile range, 15-52 days). Alpha, Gamma, and Delta variants comprised 23%, 18%, and 56%, respectively, of genetically characterized viruses. At 21-55 days postvaccination, single-dose mRNA and ChAdOx1 VE (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 74% (71%-76%) and 59% (53%-65%) against any infection and 86% (80%-90%) and 94% (85%-97%) against hospitalization, respectively. VE (95% CI) was similar against Alpha and Gamma infections for mRNA (80% [76%-84%] and 80% [75%-84%], respectively) and ChAdOx1 (69% [60%-76%] and 66% [56%-73%], respectively). mRNA VE was lower at 63% (95% CI, 56%-69%) against Delta but 85% (95% CI, 71%-92%) against Delta-associated hospitalization (nonestimable for ChAdOx1). CONCLUSIONS: A single mRNA or ChAdOx1 vaccine dose gave important protection against SARS-CoV-2, including early variants of concern. ChAdOx1 VE was lower against infection, but 1 dose of either vaccine reduced the hospitalization risk by >85% to at least 8 weeks postvaccination.

We compared 2-dose vaccine effectiveness (VE) by vaccine type (mRNA and/or ChAdOx1), interval between doses, and time since second dose in 2 of Canada's larger provinces. METHODS: Two-dose VE against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or hospitalization among adults ≥18 years, including due to Alpha, Gamma, and Delta variants of concern (VOCs), was assessed ≥14 days postvaccination by test-negative design studies separately conducted in British Columbia and Quebec, Canada, between 30 May and 27 November (epi-weeks 22-47) 2021. RESULTS: In both provinces, all homologous or heterologous mRNA and/or ChAdOx1 2-dose schedules were associated with ≥90% reduction in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization risk for ≥7 months. With slight decline from a peak of >90%, VE against infection was ≥80% for ≥6 months following homologous mRNA vaccination, lower by ∼10% when both doses were ChAdOx1 but comparably high following heterologous ChAdOx1 + mRNA receipt. Findings were similar by age group, sex, and VOC. VE was significantly higher with longer 7-8-week versus manufacturer-specified 3-4-week intervals between mRNA doses. CONCLUSIONS: Two doses of any mRNA and/or ChAdOx1 combination gave substantial and sustained protection against SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization, spanning Delta-dominant circulation. ChAdOx1 VE against infection was improved by heterologous mRNA series completion. A 7-8-week interval between first and second doses improved mRNA VE and may be the optimal schedule outside periods of intense epidemic surge. Findings support interchangeability and extended intervals between SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses, with potential global implications for low-coverage areas and, going forward, for children.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1093/cid/ciac290,"Adult;Child;Humans;British Columbia/epidemiology;Quebec/epidemiology;*SARS-CoV-2;COVID-19 Vaccines;Vaccine Efficacy;*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;RNA, Messenger;Vaccination;British Columbia;Canada;Quebec;Vaccines",35438175,PMC9047203

It is important to understand COVID-19 characteristics among HCWs before and after vaccination. We evaluated the incidence of COVID-19 among HCWs in East Java, Indonesia comparing the characteristics of the disease between the pre- vs post-vaccination periods. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted among HCWs in two major hospitals in East Java, Indonesia, between April 01, 2020, and Oct 31, 2021. All HCWs were offered vaccination with inactivated viral vaccine (CoronaVac) from Jan 15, 2021. Therefore, we divided the time of the study into the pre-vaccination period (between April 01, 2020, and Jan 14, 2021) and post-vaccination period (between Jan 15 and Oct 31, 2021). We then compared the pattern of COVID-19 infections, and hospitalisations between these periods. FINDINGS: A total of 434 (15.1%) and 649 (22.6%) SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported among study participants (n = 2878) during the pre-vaccination and post-vaccination periods, respectively. The vaccine effectiveness was 73.3% during the first 3-4 months after vaccination but this decreased to 17.6% at 6-7 months after vaccination, which coincided with the emergence of the delta variant. The overall hospitalisation rate was reduced from 23.5% in the pre-vaccination period to 14.3% in the post-vaccination period. Hypertension appeared to be the strongest risk factor affecting hospitalisation in the pre-vaccination period. However, the risk due to hypertension was reduced in the post-vaccination period. INTERPRETATION: The risk to contract COVID-19 remains high among HCWs in East Java, Indonesia. Vaccination is important to reduce infection and hospitalisation. It is essentially important to evaluate the characteristics of COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation, the impact of co-morbidities and vaccine effectiveness in order to improve the measures applied in protecting HCWs during the pandemic.

Vaccines against this disease have demonstrated variable efficacy and safety, although effectiveness has not been evaluated. In February 2021, the Ministry of Health of Peru approved the emergency use of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (Vero Cell) vaccine and initiated vaccination with health personnel at the national level. The objective of the study is to determine the effectiveness of this vaccine to reduce infections, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: We performed a retrospective cohort study in the period from 23 February to 26 June 2021; data were obtained from the Ministry of Health (including demographic, epidemiologic, clinical, hospital, laboratory results, deaths, and both date and quantity of vaccine doses delivered). The exposed cohort were those who received one or two vaccine doses and the non-exposed were unvaccinated. The events studied were infections, hospitalizations and deaths in the cohorts. We consider a case confirmed for COVID-19 if the test result was positive for SARS-CoV-2, via PCR or antigen test. Effectiveness was measured with incidence density ratio and risk. Confounding factors were controlled using a Poisson model with robust variance. RESULTS: We enlisted 520,733 health workers, of whom 415,212 had two vaccine doses and 105,521 were unvaccinated. The median age was 40 years (IQR: 32-50), and 65.6% were female. The effectiveness of two vaccine doses fourteen days after application adjusted by age, sex, hospitalization, and antecedent of having the infection was 90.9% (95% CI: 85.5-94.2%); effectiveness to avoid death from COVID-19; 67.7% (60.1-73.8%) effectiveness to avoid hospitalizations; and 26.3% (23.8-28.6%) effectiveness to reduce the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 relative to the unvaccinated cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (Vero Cell) vaccine used in two doses has an acceptable effectiveness against death and risk of hospitalization, whereas it has less effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 infection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.3390/life12091318,Vero Cells;Vaccination,36143355,PMC9503886

Data are lacking on the effectiveness of booster doses for younger individuals and health care workers. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association of a BNT162b2 booster dose with SARS-CoV-2 infections among health care workers who were previously vaccinated with a 2-dose series of BNT162b2. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a prospective cohort study conducted at a tertiary medical center in Tel Aviv, Israel. The study cohort included 1928 immunocompetent health care workers who were previously vaccinated with a 2-dose series of BNT162b2, and had enrolled between August 8 and 19, 2021, with final follow-up reported through September 20, 2021. Screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed every 14 days. Anti-spike protein receptor binding domain IgG titers were determined at baseline and 1 month after enrollment. Cox regression with time-dependent analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios of SARS-CoV-2 infection between booster-immunized status and 2-dose vaccinated (booster-nonimmunized) status. EXPOSURES: Vaccination with a booster dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, as confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Among 1928 participants, the median age was 44 years (IQR, 36-52 years) and 1381 were women (71.6%). Participants completed the 2-dose vaccination series a median of 210 days (IQR, 205-213 days) before study enrollment. A total of 1650 participants (85.6%) received the booster dose. During a median follow-up of 39 days (IQR, 35-41 days), SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 44 participants (incidence rate, 60.2 per 100 000 person-days); 31 (70.5%) were symptomatic. Five SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred in booster-immunized participants and 39 in booster-nonimmunized participants (incidence rate, 12.8 vs 116 per 100 000 person-days, respectively). In a time-dependent Cox regression analysis, the adjusted hazard ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection for booster-immunized vs booster-nonimmunized participants was 0.07 (95% CI, 0.02-0.20). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among health care workers at a single center in Israel who were previously vaccinated with a 2-dose series of BNT162b2, administration of a booster dose compared with not receiving one was associated with a significantly lower rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection over a median of 39 days of follow-up. Ongoing surveillance is required to assess durability of the findings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1001/jama.2021.23641,"Adult;Aged;Antibodies, Viral/*blood;BNT162 Vaccine/*administration & dosage/immunology;COVID-19/diagnosis/*epidemiology/prevention & control;COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing;COVID-19 Vaccines/*immunology;Female;Health Personnel/*statistics & numerical data;Humans;Immunization, Secondary;Immunoglobulin G/blood;Incidence;Israel/epidemiology;Male;Middle Aged;Proportional Hazards Models;Prospective Studies;SARS-CoV-2/immunology;Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus/immunology;*Vaccine Efficacy;Vaccination",35006256,PMC8749710

We describe a study protocol to evaluate COVID-19 VE in preventing laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in health workers (HWs) in Albania, an upper-middle-income country. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this 12-month prospective cohort study, we enrolled HWs at three hospitals in Albania. HWs are vaccinated through the routine COVID-19 vaccine campaign. Participants completed a baseline survey about demographics, clinical comorbidities, and infection risk behaviours. Baseline serology samples were also collected and tested against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and respiratory swabs were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Participants complete weekly symptom questionnaires and symptomatic participants have a respiratory swab collected, which is tested for SARS-CoV-2. At 3, 6, 9 months and 12 months of the study, serology will be collected and tested for antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and spike protein. VE will be estimated using a piecewise proportional hazards model (VE=1-HR). BASELINE DATA: From February to May 2021, 1504 HWs were enrolled. The median age was 44 (range: 22-71) and 78% were female. At enrolment, 72% of participants were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. 56% of participants were vaccinated with one dose, of whom 98% received their first shot within 4 days of enrolment.

Primary vaccination provides strong short-term protection, but data are limited on duration of protection following booster vaccines, particularly against the Omicron variant. We investigated the effectiveness of booster vaccination against infections, hospitalizations, and deaths among LTCF residents and staff in England. METHODS: We included residents and staff of LTCFs within the VIVALDI study (ISRCTN 14447421) who underwent routine, asymptomatic testing (December 12, 2021-March 31, 2022). Cox regression was used to estimate relative hazards of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and associated hospitalization and death at 0-13, 14-48, 49-83, 84-111, 112-139, and 140+ days after dose 3 of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination compared with 2 doses (after 84+ days), stratified by previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and adjusting for age, sex, LTCF capacity, and local SARS-CoV-2 incidence. RESULTS: A total of 14 175 residents and 19 793 staff were included. In residents without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, infection risk was reduced 0-111 days after the first booster, but no protection was apparent after 112 days. Additional protection following booster vaccination waned but was still present at 140+ days for COVID-associated hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.20; 95% CI, 0.06-0.63) and death (aHR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.20-1.27). Most residents (64.4%) had received primary course vaccine of AstraZeneca, but this did not impact pre- or postbooster risk. Staff showed a similar pattern of waning booster effectiveness against infection, with few hospitalizations and no deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that booster vaccination provided sustained protection against severe outcomes following infection with the Omicron variant, but no protection against infection from 4 months onwards. Ongoing surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in LTCFs is crucial.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1093/ofid/ofac694,Cohort Studies;Vaccination;Long-Term Care;Vaccines,36713473,PMC9874026

No data are available for European Countries. We aimed to explore this topic and potential independent predictors of lack of vaccination. METHODS: Between January 1st and June 30th 2022, 1512 cirrhotic subjects of any etiology were consecutively enrolled in an observational - prospective study in 8 referral centers in Italy. Adjusted Odds Ratios (O.R.) for the association with lack of vaccination and with occurrence of breakthrough infection were evaluated by multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Overall vaccine coverage was 89.7% (80% among people born abroad). Among the 1358 vaccinated people, 178 (13.1%) had a breakthrough infection; of them 12 (6.7%) were hospitalized, but none died. Independent predictors associated with lack of vaccination were birth abroad, age <65 years and lower years of schooling. Child stage B/C was the only independent predictor of breakthrough infection. Occurrence of breakthrough infection was more likely reported in subjects who received 2 doses of vaccine than in those who received 3 doses (33.9% versus 9.0%; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: High vaccine coverage against COVID-19 infection is observed among cirrhotic subjects in Italy. Vaccine is effective in preventing severe outcomes. Three doses are more effective than two, even in cirrhotic subjects. LAY SUMMARY: This large cohort study evidenced high vaccine coverage against COVID-19 infection among cirrhotic subjects in a European country and the effectiveness of vaccine in preventing severe outcomes. Three doses of vaccine are more effective than two in preventing breakthrough infection and hospitalization. Informative campaigns targeting people younger than 65 years of age and those with lower years of schooling may increase these excellent results.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1016/j.dld.2022.11.016,Aged;Child;Humans;Breakthrough Infections;Cohort Studies;*COVID-19;*COVID-19 Vaccines;Hospitalization;Italy;Liver Cirrhosis;Prospective Studies;Retrospective Studies;Vaccination;Cross Infection;Vaccines,36529636,PMC9757158

Full vaccination is estimated at 87.8% effective (95% CI: 85.8, 89.7) against COVID-19 infection and 85.4% effective (95% CI: 83.4, 87.3) against symptomatic COVID-19. Among the cohort of confirmed COVID-19 cases, partial vaccination with any of the three vaccines is estimated at 31.3% effective (95% CI: 28.5, 34.1) in preventing ICU admission, and 45.1% effective (95% CI: 42.6, 47.5) in preventing death. Full vaccination with any of the three vaccines is estimated at 79.1% effective (95% CI: 77.7, 80.4) in preventing ICU admission and 86.7% effective (95% CI: 85.7, 87.6) in preventing deaths. Our findings suggest that full vaccination with any of the three predominant vaccines (AZD1222, BNT162b2, and CoronaVac) in Malaysia has been highly effective in preventing COVID-19 infection, symptomatic COVID-19, COVID-19-related ICU admission, and death.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.3390/vaccines9121381,Malaysia;Vaccination;Vaccines,34960126,PMC8706086

A thorough characterization of vaccine protection and its duration in time is needed to inform vaccination policies and enhance public trust. METHODS: We linked three national databases with exhaustive information on screening, vaccination and hospitalizations in France from January 1st to December 12, 2021. We performed a two-step analysis to estimate vaccine effectiveness against severe outcomes of Covid-19 (requiring hospitalization) in people aged 50 years or over, combining: (i) a test-negative case-control design to assess vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infections; and (ii) a survival analysis to assess the additional protection against severe outcomes (hospitalizations, ICU admissions and inpatient deaths) in infected individuals. FINDINGS: We found a high vaccine effectiveness in people aged 50 years or more, reaching 82% against symptomatic infections and 94% against hospitalizations, after a full vaccination scheme with the Covid-19 vaccines used in France.Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infections decreased over time, dropping to 53% after six months, but remained high against severe outcomes (90% after six months). The booster dose allowed restoring protection levels above 90% against symptomatic infections. Vaccine protection and its evolution in time, showed little difference against the variants that circulated prior to December 2021 in France, including the Delta variant. INTERPRETATION: Though vaccine immunity decreases over time, vaccination remains crucial to provide individual protection against severe outcomes requiring hospitalization. This decline can be reversed by the receipt of a booster dose.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1016/j.gloepi.2022.100076,Vaccination;France;Vaccines,35662871,PMC9135646

However, these patients were largely excluded from SARS-CoV-2 vaccine clinical trials, creating a large evidence gap. OBJECTIVE: To identify the incidence rate and incidence rate ratio (IRR) for COVID-19 breakthrough infection after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among persons with or without immune dysfunction. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a partnership that developed a secure, centralized electronic medical record-based repository of COVID-19 clinical data from academic medical centers across the US. Persons who received at least 1 dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine between December 10, 2020, and September 16, 2021, were included in the sample. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Vaccination, COVID-19 diagnosis, immune dysfunction diagnoses (ie, HIV infection, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, solid organ transplant, and bone marrow transplantation), other comorbid conditions, and demographic data were accessed through the N3C Data Enclave. Breakthrough infection was defined as a COVID-19 infection that was contracted on or after the 14th day of vaccination, and the risk after full or partial vaccination was assessed for patients with or without immune dysfunction using Poisson regression with robust SEs. Poisson regression models were controlled for a study period (before or after [pre- or post-Delta variant] June 20, 2021), full vaccination status, COVID-19 infection before vaccination, demographic characteristics, geographic location, and comorbidity burden. RESULTS: A total of 664 722 patients in the N3C sample were included. These patients had a median (IQR) age of 51 (34-66) years and were predominantly women (n = 378 307 [56.9%]). Overall, the incidence rate for COVID-19 breakthrough infection was 5.0 per 1000 person-months among fully vaccinated persons but was higher after the Delta variant became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain (incidence rate before vs after June 20, 2021, 2.2 [95% CI, 2.2-2.2] vs 7.3 [95% CI, 7.3-7.4] per 1000 person-months). Compared with partial vaccination, full vaccination was associated with a 28% reduced risk for breakthrough infection (adjusted IRR [AIRR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.68-0.76). People with a breakthrough infection after full vaccination were more likely to be older and women. People with HIV infection (AIRR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.18-1.49), rheumatoid arthritis (AIRR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.09-1.32), and solid organ transplant (AIRR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.96-2.38) had a higher rate of breakthrough infection. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that full vaccination was associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 breakthrough infection, regardless of the immune status of patients. Despite full vaccination, persons with immune dysfunction had substantially higher risk for COVID-19 breakthrough infection than those without such a condition. For persons with immune dysfunction, continued use of nonpharmaceutical interventions (eg, mask wearing) and alternative vaccine strategies (eg, additional doses or immunogenicity testing) are recommended even after full vaccination.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.7024,Adult;Aged;COVID-19/*diagnosis/*epidemiology;COVID-19 Testing/*statistics & numerical data;COVID-19 Vaccines;Cohort Studies;Female;*Health Status;Humans;Incidence;Male;Middle Aged;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;SARS-CoV-2/isolation & purification;Sex Distribution;Vaccination/*statistics & numerical data;Vaccination,34962505,PMC8715386

COVID-19 vaccines used at the time of the outbreak were inactivated, 91.8%; protein subunit, 7.5%; and adenovirus5-vectored, 0.7% vaccines. The outbreaks provided an opportunity to evaluate variant-specific breakthrough infection rates and relative protective effectiveness of homologous inactivated COVID-19 vaccine booster doses against symptomatic infection and pneumonia. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study METHODS: We evaluated relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) with a retrospective cohort study of close contacts of infected individuals using a time-dependent Cox regression model. Demographic and epidemiologic data were obtained from the local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; clinical and laboratory data were obtained from COVID-19-designated hospitals. Vaccination histories were obtained from the national COVID-19 vaccination dataset. All data were linked by national identification number. RESULTS: Among 784 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 379 (48.3%) were caused by Delta and 405 (51.7%) were caused by Omicron, with breakthrough rates of 9.9% and 17.8%, respectively. Breakthrough rates among boosted individuals were 8.1% and 4.9%. Compared with subjects who received primary vaccination series ≥180 days before infection, Cox regression modelling showed that homologous inactivated booster vaccination was statistically significantly associated with protection from symptomatic infection caused by Omicron (rVE 59%; 95% CI 13% to 80%) and pneumonia caused by Delta (rVE 62%; 95% CI 34% to 77%) and Omicron (rVE 87%; 95% CI 3% to 98%).

In the United States, as of November 19, 2021, boosters were recommended for all adults aged 18 years and older. We evaluated the effectiveness of a third dose of BNT162b2 among adults in a large US integrated health system. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed electronic health records from Kaiser Permanente Southern California between Dec 14, 2020 and Dec 5, 2021 to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) of two and three doses of BNT162b2 against SARS-CoV-2 infections (without hospital admission) andCOVID-19-related hospital admission. VE was calculated using hazards ratios from adjusted Cox models. FINDINGS: After only two doses, VE against infection declined from 85% (95% CI 83-86) during the first month to 49% (46-51) ≥ 7 months following vaccination. Overall VE against hospitalization was 90% (95% CI 86-92) within one month and did not wane, however, effectiveness against hospitalization appeared to wane among immunocompromised individuals but was not statistically significant (93% [72-98] at 1 month to 74% [45-88] after ≥ 7 months; p=0·490). Three-dose VE (median follow-up 1·3 months [SD 0·6]) was 88% (95% CI 86-89) against infection and 97% (95-98) against hospitalization.

Vaccine-specific estimates are especially needed. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and durability of two and three doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA vaccine against hospital and emergency department admissions due to the delta (B.1.617.2) and omicron variants. METHODS: In this case-control study with a test-negative design, we analysed electronic health records of members of Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), a large integrated health system in California, USA, from Dec 1, 2021, to Feb 6, 2022. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated in KPSC patients aged 18 years and older admitted to hospital or an emergency department (without a subsequent hospital admission) with a diagnosis of acute respiratory infection and tested for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness was estimated with odds ratios from adjusted logistic regression models. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04848584). FINDINGS: Analyses were done for 11 123 hospital or emergency department admissions. In adjusted analyses, effectiveness of two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine against the omicron variant was 41% (95% CI 21-55) against hospital admission and 31% (16-43) against emergency department admission at 9 months or longer after the second dose. After three doses, effectiveness of BNT162b2 against hospital admission due to the omicron variant was 85% (95% CI 80-89) at less than 3 months but fell to 55% (28-71) at 3 months or longer, although confidence intervals were wide for the latter estimate. Against emergency department admission, the effectiveness of three doses of BNT162b2 against the omicron variant was 77% (72-81) at less than 3 months but fell to 53% (36-66) at 3 months or longer. Trends in waning against SARS-CoV-2 outcomes due to the delta variant were generally similar, but with higher effectiveness estimates at each timepoint than those seen for the omicron variant. INTERPRETATION: Three doses of BNT162b2 conferred high protection against hospital and emergency department admission due to both the delta and omicron variants in the first 3 months after vaccination. However, 3 months after receipt of a third dose, waning was apparent against SARS-CoV-2 outcomes due to the omicron variant, including hospital admission. Additional doses of current, adapted, or novel COVD-19 vaccines might be needed to maintain high levels of protection against subsequent waves of SARS-CoV-2 caused by the omicron variant or future variants with similar escape potential.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate vaccine effectiveness (VE) and durability associated with 2 doses of BNT162b2 against Delta- and Omicron-related emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) encounters among adolescents aged 12 to 17 years and to estimate VE associated with 3 doses against these same outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This test-negative case-control study was conducted at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, an integrated health care system using electronic health records in the US. Participants included Kaiser Permanente Southern California members ages 12 to 17 years with an ED or UC encounter from November 1, 2021, through March 18, 2022, for acute respiratory infection who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 via a reverse transction-polymerase chain reaction test. Analyses were conducted from March 21 to June 22, 2022. EXPOSURES: BNT162b2 vaccination status ascertained from electronic health records and state registry data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was VE associated with BNT162b2 against ED and UC encounters related to Delta or Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Analyses were conducted among 3168 adolescents, including 1004 with ED visits and 2164 with UC visits. Median (IQR) age was 15 (13-16) years, and 1461 (46.1%) were boys. In adjusted analyses, VE associated with 2 doses of BNT162b2 against ED or UC encounters was highest within the first 2 months for both Delta (89% [95% CI, 69% to 96%]) and Omicron (73% [95% CI, 54% to 84%]) variants but waned to 49% (95% CI, 27% to 65%) for the Delta variant and 16% (95% CI, -7% to 34%) for the Omicron variant at 6 months and beyond. A third dose of BNT162b2 was associated with improved protection against the Omicron variant (87% [95% CI, 72% to 94%]) after a median (IQR) of 19 (9-32) days after dose 3. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that 2 doses of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine were associated with high levels of protection against ED and UC encounters related to the Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the first few months after vaccination. However, effectiveness waned over time, especially against Omicron. A third dose of BNT162b2 was associated with improved protection against Omicron beyond that seen initially after 2 doses, underscoring the importance of boosters for adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.25162,"Adolescent;Ambulatory Care;BNT162 Vaccine;*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines;Case-Control Studies;Child;Emergency Service, Hospital;Female;Humans;Male;SARS-CoV-2;*Vaccines",35921109,PMC9350713

Respiratory medicine,2213-2619 (Electronic),11,2,176-187,Tartof SY and Slezak JM and Puzniak L and Hong V and Frankland TB and Xie F and Ackerson BK and Valluri SR and Jodar L and McLaughlin JM,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36216013/,eng,,England,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 omicron (B.1.1.529 BA.1) lineage was first detected in November, 2021, and is associated with reduced vaccine effectiveness. By March, 2022, BA.1 had been replaced by sub-lineage BA.2 in the USA. As new variants evolve, vaccine performance must be continually assessed. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and durability of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) against hospital and emergency department admissions for BA.1 and BA.2. METHODS: In this test-negative, case-control study, we sourced data from the electronic health records of adult (aged ≥18 years) members of Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), which is a health-care system in the USA, who were admitted to one of 15 KPSC hospitals or emergency departments (without subsequent hospitalisation) between Dec 27, 2021, and June 4, 2022, with an acute respiratory infection and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Omicron sub-lineage was determined by use of sequencing, spike gene target failure, and the predominance of variants in certain time periods. Our main outcome was the effectiveness of two or three doses of BNT162b2 in preventing emergency department or hospital admission. Variant-specific vaccine effectiveness was evaluated by comparing the odds ratios from logistic regression models of vaccination between test-positive cases and test-negative controls, adjusting for the month of admission, age, sex, race and ethnicity, body-mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, previous influenza or pneumococcal vaccines, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also assessed effectiveness by the time since vaccination. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04848584, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Of 65 813 total admissions during the study period, we included 16 994 in our analyses, of which 7435 were due to BA.1, 1056 were due to BA.2, and 8503 were not due to SARS-CoV-2. In adjusted analyses, two-dose vaccine effectiveness was 40% (95% CI 27 to 50) for hospitalisation and 29% (18 to 38) for emergency department admission against BA.1 and 56% (31 to 72) for hospitalisation and 16% (-5 to 33) for emergency department admission against BA.2. Three-dose vaccine effectiveness was 79% (74 to 83) for hospitalisation and 72% (67 to 77) for emergency department admission against BA.1 and 71% (55 to 81) for hospitalisation and 21% (1 to 37) for emergency department admission against BA.2. Less than 3 months after the third dose, vaccine effectiveness was 80% (74 to 84) for hospitalisation and 74% (69 to 78) for emergency department admission against BA.1. Vaccine effectiveness 3 months or more after the third dose was 76% (69 to 82) against BA.1-related hospitalisation and 65% (56 to 73) against BA.1-related emergency department admission. Against BA.2, vaccine effectiveness was 74% (47 to 87) for hospitalisation and 59% (40 to 72) for emergency department admission at less than 3 months after the third dose and 70% (53 to 81) for hospitalisation and 5% (-21 to 25) for emergency department admission at 3 months or more after the third dose. INTERPRETATION: Two doses of BNT162b2 provided only partial protection against BA.1-related and BA.2-related hospital and emergency department admission, which underscores the need for booster doses against omicron. Although three doses offered high levels of protection (≥70%) against hospitalisation, variant-adapted vaccines are probably needed to improve protection against less severe endpoints, like emergency department admission, especially for BA.2.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines-mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech)-and COVID-19 hospitalization, and, among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the association with progression to critical disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A US 21-site case-control analysis of 4513 adults hospitalized between March 11 and August 15, 2021, with 28-day outcome data on death and mechanical ventilation available for patients enrolled through July 14, 2021. Date of final follow-up was August 8, 2021. EXPOSURES: COVID-19 vaccination. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Associations were evaluated between prior vaccination and (1) hospitalization for COVID-19, in which case patients were those hospitalized for COVID-19 and control patients were those hospitalized for an alternative diagnosis; and (2) disease progression among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, in which cases and controls were COVID-19 patients with and without progression to death or mechanical ventilation, respectively. Associations were measured with multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 4513 patients (median age, 59 years [IQR, 45-69]; 2202 [48.8%] women; 23.0% non-Hispanic Black individuals, 15.9% Hispanic individuals, and 20.1% with an immunocompromising condition), 1983 were case patients with COVID-19 and 2530 were controls without COVID-19. Unvaccinated patients accounted for 84.2% (1669/1983) of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Hospitalization for COVID-19 was significantly associated with decreased likelihood of vaccination (cases, 15.8%; controls, 54.8%; adjusted OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.13-0.18), including for sequenced SARS-CoV-2 Alpha (8.7% vs 51.7%; aOR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.06-0.16) and Delta variants (21.9% vs 61.8%; aOR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.10-0.21). This association was stronger for immunocompetent patients (11.2% vs 53.5%; aOR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.09-0.13) than immunocompromised patients (40.1% vs 58.8%; aOR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35-0.69) (P < .001) and weaker at more than 120 days since vaccination with BNT162b2 (5.8% vs 11.5%; aOR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.27-0.49) than with mRNA-1273 (1.9% vs 8.3%; aOR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.09-0.23) (P < .001). Among 1197 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, death or invasive mechanical ventilation by day 28 was associated with decreased likelihood of vaccination (12.0% vs 24.7%; aOR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.19-0.58). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was significantly less likely among patients with COVID-19 hospitalization and disease progression to death or mechanical ventilation. These findings are consistent with risk reduction among vaccine breakthrough infections compared with absence of vaccination.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: case-control",10.1001/jama.2021.19499,"*2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273;Adult;Aged;*BNT162 Vaccine;*COVID-19/classification/epidemiology/mortality/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines/classification;Case-Control Studies;Disease Progression;Female;Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Respiration, Artificial;SARS-CoV-2;Severity of Illness Index;Vaccination;RNA, Messenger;Vaccines",34734975,PMC8569602

However, how well mRNA vaccines protect against the most severe outcomes of these hospitalizations, including invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death is uncertain. Using a case-control design, mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19-associated IMV and in-hospital death was evaluated among adults aged ≥18 years hospitalized at 21 U.S. medical centers during March 11, 2021-January 24, 2022. During this period, the most commonly circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, were B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617.2 (Delta), and B.1.1.529 (Omicron). Previous vaccination (2 or 3 versus 0 vaccine doses before illness onset) in prospectively enrolled COVID-19 case-patients who received IMV or died within 28 days of hospitalization was compared with that among hospitalized control patients without COVID-19. Among 1,440 COVID-19 case-patients who received IMV or died, 307 (21%) had received 2 or 3 vaccine doses before illness onset. Among 6,104 control-patients, 4,020 (66%) had received 2 or 3 vaccine doses. Among the 1,440 case-patients who received IMV or died, those who were vaccinated were older (median age = 69 years), more likely to be immunocompromised* (40%), and had more chronic medical conditions compared with unvaccinated case-patients (median age = 55 years; immunocompromised = 10%; p<0.001 for both). VE against IMV or in-hospital death was 90% (95% CI = 88%-91%) overall, including 88% (95% CI = 86%-90%) for 2 doses and 94% (95% CI = 91%-96%) for 3 doses, and 94% (95% CI = 88%-97%) for 3 doses during the Omicron-predominant period. COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are highly effective in preventing COVID-19-associated death and respiratory failure treated with IMV.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, predominantly against the delta (B.1.617.2) variant, in addition to the cellular immune response to vaccination. METHODS: We did a test-negative, case-control study at two medical research centres in Faridabad, India. All individuals who had a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection between April 1, 2021, and May 31, 2021, were included as cases and individuals who had a negative RT-PCR test were included as controls after matching with cases on calendar week of RT-PCR test. The primary outcome was effectiveness of complete vaccination with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The secondary outcomes were effectiveness of a single dose against SARS-CoV-2 infection and effectiveness of a single dose and complete vaccination against moderate-to-severe disease among infected individuals. Additionally, we tested in-vitro live-virus neutralisation and T-cell immune responses to the spike protein of the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and VOCs among healthy (anti-nucleocapsid antibody negative) recipients of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. FINDINGS: Of 2379 cases of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 85 (3·6%) were fully vaccinated compared with 168 (8·5%) of 1981 controls (adjusted OR [aOR] 0·37 [95% CI 0·28-0·48]), giving a vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection of 63·1% (95% CI 51·5-72·1). 157 (6·4%) of 2451 of cases and 181 (9·1%) of 1994) controls had received a single dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (aOR 0·54 [95% CI 0·42-0·68]), thus vaccine effectiveness of a single dose against SARS-CoV-2 infection was 46·2% (95% CI 31·6-57·7). One of 84 cases with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 was fully vaccinated compared with 84 of 2295 cases with mild COVID-19 (aOR 0·19 [95% CI 0·01-0·90]), giving a vaccine effectiveness of complete vaccination against moderate-to-severe disease of 81·5% (95% CI 9·9-99·0). The effectiveness of a single dose against moderate-to-severe disease was 79·2% (95% CI 46·1-94·0); four of 87 individuals with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 had received a single dose compared with 153 of 2364 participants with mild disease (aOR 0·20 [95% CI 0·06-0·54]). Among 49 healthy, fully vaccinated individuals, neutralising antibody responses were lower against the alpha (B.1.1.7; geometric mean titre 244·7 [95% CI 151·8-394·4]), beta (B.1.351; 97·6 [61·2-155·8]), kappa (B.1.617.1; 112·8 [72·7-175·0]), and delta (88·4 [61·2-127·8]) variants than against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (599·4 [376·9-953·2]). However, the antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses were conserved against both the delta variant and wild-type SARS-CoV-2. INTERPRETATION: The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine remained effective against moderate-to-severe COVID-19, even during a surge that was dominated by the highly transmissible delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. Spike-specific T-cell responses were maintained against the delta variant. Such cellular immune protection might compensate for waning humoral immunity.

METHODS: In this prospective cohort study in a population that was generally infection-naive before the large omicron BA.2 wave between January and late May, 2022, we established a public health surveillance platform to monitor the evolving activity of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the community. We recruited a cohort of individuals aged 5 years and older between March 1 and March 7, 2022, from the general population. Individuals were enrolled from all 18 districts of Hong Kong, according to a predefined age-stratified quota, primarily by random digit dialing (generating suitable eight-digit local telephone numbers by randomly picking sets of the first four digits from a sampling frame, and randomly generating the last four digits), and supplemented by our existing cohorts (which included cohorts for studying influenza vaccination from school-based vaccination programmes and cohorts for SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence from the community), to ensure representativeness of the population in Hong Kong. Participants did weekly rapid antigen testing with a self-collected pooled nasal and throat swab, regardless of symptom and exposure status, from March 1 to April 15, 2022. Individuals reporting a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by laboratory PCR testing before enrolment were excluded from the vaccine effectiveness analysis to avoid potential bias due to infection-induced immunity. The primary outcomes of the study were the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including asymptomatic and symptomatic infections, and the vaccine effectiveness of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac vaccines. The effectiveness of one, two, and three doses of vaccination was estimated with a Cox proportional hazards regression model with time-dependent covariates, allowing for changes in vaccination status over time, after adjustment for demographic factors and pre-existing medical conditions. FINDINGS: Of the 8636 individuals included in the analysis, 7233 (84%) received at least two doses of vaccine, 3993 (46%) received booster doses, and 903 (10%) reported SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among these infections 589 (65·2%) were symptomatic and 314 (34·8%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing. Statistically significant protection against asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 omicron infection was found only for those who received a BNT162b2 or CoronaVac booster dose, with a vaccine effectiveness of 41·4% (23·2 to 55·2; p=0·0001) and 32·4% (9·0 to 49·8; p=0·0098), respectively. The vaccine effectiveness of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac boosters was further increased to 50·9% (95% CI 31·0-65·0; p<0·0001) and 41·6% (15·0-59·8; p=0·0049), respectively, for symptomatic omicron infections. A similar pattern of vaccine effectiveness (55·8%, 22·9-74·6; p=0·0040) was also conferred after receipt of a BNT162b2 booster by individuals who received a CoronaVac primary vaccination series. INTERPRETATION: Two doses of either vaccine did not provide significant protection against COVID-19 infection. However, receipt of a BNT162b2 booster or CoronaVac booster was associated with a significantly lower risk of omicron BA.2 infection and symptomatic infection. Our findings confirm the effectiveness of booster doses to protect against mild and asymptomatic infection.

Vaccination is a key preventative strategy but is associated with decreased humoral responses among SOTR. Whether dampened immune responses correlate with reduced clinical effectiveness is unclear. Our study was designed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the early vaccine era. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study comparing SARS-CoV-2 infection rates between SOTRs who received two doses of mRNA or one dose of Ad26.Cov2.S vaccine and those not fully vaccinated (partially vaccinated and unvaccinated). To evaluate clinical effectiveness of vaccine, cause-specific Cox regression model and modified Poisson regression model were built using the propensity score-matched cohort. Additionally, the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 of fully vaccinated and not fully vaccinated SOTR were compared. RESULTS: Of 2705 SOTRs, 1668 were included in our final matched analysis, which showed a 73% reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 76% reduction of all-cause-mortality among fully vaccinated patients. Thirty-nine SOTRs developed SARS-CoV-2 infection, including nine fully vaccinated and 30 not fully vaccinated. Among fully vaccinated patients, 22% had severe/critical COVID-19 and 0% mortality versus not fully vaccinated SOTRs, of whom 37% had severe/critical COVID-19 and 6.67% COVID-19-related mortality. CONCLUSION: In SOTRs, completion of primary vaccine series in the early vaccine era was associated with a significant reduction of COVID-19 and was protective against severe/critical disease and death. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of current vaccine recommendations for SOTR against emerging new variants.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1111/tid.13876,Ad26COVS1;*COVID-19/prevention & control;*COVID-19 Vaccines/adverse effects;Humans;*Organ Transplantation/adverse effects;Propensity Score;Retrospective Studies;SARS-CoV-2;Transplant Recipients;Treatment Outcome;Viral Vaccines;Organ Transplantation;Vaccination,35684932,PMC9348300

However, syndrome-negative controls have been proposed for differentiating bias and true estimates in VE evaluations for COVID-19. To understand the use of alternative control groups, we compared characteristics and VE estimates of syndrome-negative and test-negative VE controls. METHODS: Adults hospitalized at 21 medical centers in 18 states March 11-August 31, 2021 were eligible for analysis. Case patients had symptomatic acute respiratory infection (ARI) and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Control groups were test-negative patients with ARI but negative SARS-CoV-2 testing, and syndrome-negative controls were without ARI and negative SARS-CoV-2 testing. Chi square and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to detect differences in baseline characteristics. VE against COVID-19 hospitalization was calculated using logistic regression comparing adjusted odds of prior mRNA vaccination between cases hospitalized with COVID-19 and each control group. RESULTS: 5811 adults (2726 cases, 1696 test-negative controls, and 1389 syndrome-negative controls) were included. Control groups differed across characteristics including age, race/ethnicity, employment, previous hospitalizations, medical conditions, and immunosuppression. However, control-group-specific VE estimates were very similar. Among immunocompetent patients aged 18-64 years, VE was 93 % (95 % CI: 90-94) using syndrome-negative controls and 91 % (95 % CI: 88-93) using test-negative controls. CONCLUSIONS: Despite demographic and clinical differences between control groups, the use of either control group produced similar VE estimates across age groups and immunosuppression status. These findings support the use of test-negative controls and increase confidence in COVID-19 VE estimates produced by test-negative design studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative | USER-NOTES: {""Sabir""=>[""discusses and compares choice of controls in test-negative design""]}",10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.10.034,"Humans;Adult;United States/epidemiology;*Influenza, Human/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines;SARS-CoV-2;*COVID-19/prevention & control;COVID-19 Testing;Vaccine Efficacy;Case-Control Studies;*Influenza Vaccines;Hospitalization;Syndrome;Vaccination;Hospital Units;United States",36374708,PMC9595377

The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 and the fatality rate in HD patients. A retrospective registry-based cohort study was performed in all HD adult patients in the Pomeranian Voivodeship. Vaccinations were carried out from January to April 2021 with mRNA vaccines, either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 with two-dose schedule. In the first analysis (2nd pandemic wave), 1,160 unvaccinated patients were included (59.7% males, 25.7% diabetic). In the second analysis (4th pandemic wave), 1,131 (59.4% male, 30.7% diabetic) individuals were included, 1,042 (92.13%) were fully vaccinated. Three hundred and fifteen HD patients (27.2%) were COVID-19 positive during the 2nd wave, and 6.9% (78/1,131) during the 4th wave. Within the fully vaccinated patients of the 4th wave, 60 were COVID-19 positive, 5.8 vs. 20.2% of unvaccinated COVID-19 positive patients in 2nd wave, respectively. COVID-19 incidence rate ratio (IRR) was 0.21 (4th wave-vaccinated vs. 2nd wave-unvaccinated) indicating a 79% reduction. The IRR between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients of the 4th wave was 0.28 in favor of vaccinated patients with 72% reduction. In the 2nd wave, 93 patients died as a result of COVID-19 (fatality rate: 29.5%). The fatality rate of fully vaccinated patients during the 4th wave was 6.7% (p = 0.004), while the fatality rate in the 4th wave within unvaccinated patients accounted for 11.1%.

The VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection after primary vaccination with an mRNA (Comirnaty or Spikevax) or vector-based vaccine (Vaxzevria or Janssen) was calculated using logistic regression adjusting for age, sex and calendar week (Model 1). We additionally adjusted for comorbidity and education level (Model 2) and SARS-CoV-2 exposure (number of close contacts, visiting busy locations, household size, face mask wearing, contact with SARS-CoV-2 case; Model 3). We stratified by age, vaccine type and time since vaccination.ResultsVE against infection (Model 3) was 64% (95% CI: 50-73), only slightly lower than in Models 1 (68%; 95% CI: 58-76) and 2 (67%; 95% CI: 56-75). Estimates stratified by age group, vaccine and time since vaccination remained similar: mRNA VE (Model 3) among people ≥ 50 years decreased significantly (p = 0.01) from 81% (95% CI: 66-91) at < 120 days to 61% (95% CI: 22-80) at ≥ 120 days after vaccination.

We aimed to evaluate vaccine effectiveness and impact on serogroup B meningococcal disease and gonorrhoea 2 years after implementation of the programme. METHODS: We did a cohort and case-control study among those targeted by the South Australia 4CMenB vaccination programme. We obtained disease notification data from SA Health, Government of South Australia, and vaccine coverage data from the South Australian records of the Australian Immunisation Register. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as the reduction in the odds of infection using the screening and case-control methods. Vaccine impact was estimated as incidence rate ratios (IRRs), obtained by comparing case numbers in each year following the start of the vaccination programme with cases in the equivalent age cohort during the pre-vaccination programme years. We used Poisson or negative binomial models, as appropriate, with adjustment for changes in the incidence of serogroup B meningococcal disease in age cohorts not eligible for vaccination through the state programme. FINDINGS: 4CMenB vaccine coverage 2 years after introduction of the childhood vaccination programme was 94·9% (33 357 of 35 144 eligible individuals) for one dose, 91·4% (26 443 of 28 922) for two doses, and 79·4% (15 440 of 19 436) for three doses in infants. The one-dose (77·1%, 16 422 of 21 305) and two-dose (69·0%, 14 704 of 21 305) coverage was highest in adolescents born in 2003 (approximately year 10 students). 2 years after implementation of the childhood vaccination programme, incidence of serogroup B meningococcal disease was significantly reduced compared with before programme implementation in infants aged 12 weeks to 11 months (adjusted IRR [aIRR] 0·40 [95% CI 0·23-0·69], p=0·0011), but not in those aged 1 year (0·79 [0·16-3·87], p=0·77), 2 years (0·75 [0·18-3·14], p=0·70), or 4 years (3·00 [0·47-18·79], p=0·24). aIRRs were not calculable in those aged 3 or 5 years because of no cases occurring after programme implementation. aIRR for serogroup B meningococcal disease was 0·27 (0·06-1·16, p=0·078) in adolescents aged 15-18 years 2 years after implementation of the adolescent and young adult programme, and 1·20 (0·70-2·06, p=0·51) in those aged 19-21 years in the first year. Two-dose vaccine effectiveness against serogroup B meningococcal disease was estimated to be 94·2% (95% CI 36·6-99·5) using the screening method and 94·7% (40·3-99·5) using the case-control method in children, and 100% in adolescents and young adults (no cases reported after implementation). Estimated two-dose vaccine effectiveness against gonorrhoea in adolescents and young adults was 32·7% (8·3-50·6) based on the case-control method using age-matched individuals with chlamydia infection as controls. INTERPRETATION: 4CMenB vaccine shows sustained effectiveness against serogroup B meningococcal disease 2 years after introduction in infants and adolescents, and moderate effectiveness against gonorrhoea in adolescents. The high vaccine effectiveness against serogroup B meningococcal disease is likely due to high coverage in the target age groups and close antigenic match between the 4CMenB vaccine and the disease-associated serogroup B meningococcal strains circulating in South Australia. COVID-19-related physical distancing policies might have contributed to further declines in serogroup B meningococcal disease cases during the programme's second year.

METHODS: Using national registry data, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2-positive patients hospitalized in Norway between 1 February and 30 November 2021, with COVID-19 as the main cause of hospitalization. We ran Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for vaccination status, age, sex, county of residence, regional health authority, date of admission, country of birth, virus variant, and underlying risk factors. RESULTS: We included 716 fully vaccinated patients (crude overall median LoS: 5.2 days; admitted to ICU: 103 (14%); in-hospital death: 86 (13%)) and 2487 unvaccinated patients (crude overall median LoS: 5.0 days; admitted to ICU: 480 (19%); in-hospital death: 102 (4%)).

OBJECTIVES: To report statewide trends in vaccine administration and vaccine effectiveness in Minnesota. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used COVID-19 vaccine data from the Minnesota Immunization Information Connection from October 25, 2020, through October 30, 2021 that were linked with electronic health record (EHR) data from health systems collaborating as part of the Minnesota EHR Consortium (MNEHRC). Participants included individuals who were seen at a participating health system in Minnesota. EXPOSURES: Individuals were considered fully vaccinated in the second week after receipt of a second dose of a BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine or a single dose of an Ad26.COV.2.S vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A completed vaccination series and vaccine breakthrough, defined as either a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test or a hospital admission the same week or within the 3 weeks following a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. A test-negative design and incident rate ratio were used to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness separately for the BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and Ad26.COV.2.S vaccines. Rurality and social vulnerability index were assessed at the area level. RESULTS: This study included 4 431 190 unique individuals at participating health systems, and 3 013 704 (68%) of the individuals were fully vaccinated. Vaccination rates were lowest among Minnesotans who identified as Hispanic (116 422 of 217 019 [54%]), multiracial (30 066 of 57 412 [52%]), American Indian or Alaska Native (22 190 of 41 437 [54%]), and Black or African American (158 860 of 326 595 [49%]) compared with Minnesotans who identified as Asian or Pacific Islander (159 999 of 210 994 [76%]) or White (2 402 928 of 3 391 747 [71%]). Among individuals aged 19 to 64 years, vaccination rates were lower in rural areas (196 479 of 308 047 [64%]) compared with urban areas (151 541 of 1 951 265 [77%]) and areas with high social vulnerability (544 433 of 774 952 [70%]) compared with areas with low social vulnerability (571 613 of 724 369 [79%]). In the 9 weeks ending October 30, 2021, vaccine effectiveness as assessed by a test-negative design was 33% (95% CI, 30%-37%) for Ad26.COV.2.S; 53% (95% CI, 52%-54%) for BNT162b2; and 66% (95% CI, 65%-67%) for mRNA-1273. For SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalizations, vaccine effectiveness in the 9 weeks ending October 30, 2021, was 78% (95% CI, 75%-81%) for Ad26.COV.2.S; 81% (95% CI, 79%-82%) for BNT162b2; and 81% (95% CI, 79%-82%) for mRNA-1273. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study of data from a Minnesota statewide consortium suggests disparities in vaccine administration and effectiveness. Vaccine effectiveness against infection was lower for Ad26.COV.2.S and BNT162b2 but was associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalizations despite the increased prevalence of the Delta variant in Minnesota.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.5018,2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273;Adult;BNT162 Vaccine;*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines;Cohort Studies;Humans;Middle Aged;SARS-CoV-2;*Viral Vaccines;Young Adult;Vaccination,35357452,PMC8972031

Data on which vaccines offer the most robust protection over time, and which patients are most vulnerable to attenuating protection, could help inform potential booster programmes. In this study, we used comprehensive hospitalisation data to estimate vaccine effectiveness over time. METHODS: In this case-control study, we used data from a large US health-care system to estimate vaccine effectiveness against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and examined variation based on time since vaccination, vaccine type, and patients' demographic and clinical characteristics. We compared trends in attenuation of protection across vaccines and used a multivariable model to identify key factors associated with risk for severe breakthrough infection. Patients were considered to have severe COVID-19 if they were admitted to the hospital, had a final coded diagnosis of COVID-19 (according to International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision code U07.1) or a positive nucleic acid amplification test for symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 during their hospitalisation, and were treated with remdesivir or dexamethasone during hospitalisation. FINDINGS: Between April 1, 2021, and Oct 26, 2021, we observed 9667 admissions for severe COVID-19 (ie, cases). Overall, 1293 (13·4%) of 9667 cases were fully vaccinated at the time of admission, compared with 22 308 (57·7%) of 38 668 controls, who were admitted to hospital for other reasons. The median time between vaccination and hospital admission among cases was 162 days (IQR 118-198). Overall vaccine effectiveness declined mostly over the course of the summer, from 94·5% (95% CI 91·4-96·5) in April, 2021 (pre-delta), to 84·0% (81·6-86·1) by October, 2021. Notably, vaccine effectiveness declined over time, from 94·0% (95% CI 92·8-95·0) at days 50-100 after vaccination to 80·4% (77·8-82·7) by days 200-250 after vaccination. After 250 days, vaccine effectiveness declines were even more notable. Among those who received the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine, vaccine effectiveness fell from an initial peak of 94·9% (93·2-96·2) to 74·1% (69·6-77·9) by days 200-250 after vaccination. Protection from the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and Ad26.COV2 (Janssen) vaccines declined less over time, although the latter offered lower overall protection. Holding other factors constant, the risk of severe breakthrough infection was most strongly associated with age older than 80 years (adjusted odds ratio 1·76, 95% CI 1·43-2·15), vaccine type (Pfizer 1·39, 0·98-1·97; Janssen 14·53, 8·43-25·03; both relative to Moderna), time since vaccination (1·05, 1·03-1·07; per week after week 8 when protection peaks, technically), and comorbidities including organ transplantation (3·44, 95% CI 2·12-5·57), cancer (1·93, 1·60-2·33), and immunodeficiency (1·49, 1·13-1·96). INTERPRETATION: Vaccination remains highly effective against hospitalisation, but vaccine effectiveness declined after 200 days, particularly for older patients or those with specific comorbidities. Additional protection (eg, a booster vaccination) might be warranted for everyone, but especially for these populations. In addition to promoting general vaccine uptake, clinicians and policy makers should consider prioritising booster vaccinations in those most at risk of severe COVID-19. FUNDING: None.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: case-control",10.1016/S2213-2600(22)00042-X,"Aged, 80 and over;BNT162 Vaccine;*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;COVID-19 Vaccines/therapeutic use;Case-Control Studies;Hospitals;Humans;SARS-CoV-2;Vaccine Efficacy;Vaccination",35227415,PMC8881000

OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infections among a population of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective, multicenter, nationwide cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and infection among patients in the VA health care system from December 15, 2020, to May 4, 2021. All adults with solid tumors or hematologic cancer who received systemic cancer-directed therapy from August 15, 2010, to May 4, 2021, and were alive and without a documented SARS-CoV-2 positive result as of December 15, 2020, were eligible for inclusion. Each day between December 15, 2020, and May 4, 2021, newly vaccinated patients were matched 1:1 with unvaccinated or not yet vaccinated controls based on age, race and ethnicity, VA facility, rurality of home address, cancer type, and treatment type/timing. EXPOSURES: Receipt of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. A proxy for vaccine effectiveness was defined as 1 minus the risk ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection for vaccinated individuals compared with unvaccinated controls. RESULTS: A total of 184 485 patients met eligibility criteria, and 113 796 were vaccinated. Of these, 29 152 vaccinated patients (median [IQR] age, 74.1 [70.2-79.3] years; 95% were men; 71% were non-Hispanic White individuals) were matched 1:1 to unvaccinated or not yet vaccinated controls. As of a median 47 days of follow-up, 436 SARS-CoV-2 infections were detected in the matched cohort (161 infections in vaccinated patients vs 275 in unvaccinated patients). There were 17 COVID-19-related deaths in the vaccinated group vs 27 COVID-19-related deaths in the unvaccinated group. Overall vaccine effectiveness in the matched cohort was 58% (95% CI, 39% to 72%) starting 14 days after the second dose. Patients who received chemotherapy within 3 months prior to the first vaccination dose were estimated to have a vaccine effectiveness of 57% (95% CI, -23% to 90%) starting 14 days after the second dose vs 76% (95% CI, 50% to 91%) for those receiving endocrine therapy and 85% (95% CI, 29% to 100%) for those who had not received systemic therapy for at least 6 months prior. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in patients with cancer. Some immunosuppressed subgroups may remain at early risk for COVID-19 despite vaccination, and consideration should be given to additional risk reduction strategies, such as serologic testing for vaccine response and a third vaccine dose to optimize outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1001/jamaoncol.2021.5771,Adult;Aged;*COVID-19;COVID-19 Vaccines;Cohort Studies;Humans;Male;*Neoplasms;Retrospective Studies;SARS-CoV-2;Vaccination;*Veterans,34854921,PMC8640949

People living with HIV (PLWH) appear to have an elevated risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, yet the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine in this population remains unclear due to the limited research efforts in this population in the real world. This study aims to characterise and compare the breakthrough COVID-19 (eg, prevalence and disease severity) between PLWH and non-PLWH and then examine whether HIV markers play a role in COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness within the PLWH population. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This cohort study will merge electronic health records data from multiple data sources in South Carolina (SC), including the 'HIV Cohort' (n=12 203) identified from the statewide Enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System, 'Vaccine Cohort' from the Statewide Immunisation Online Network which provides patient-level immunisation records (n=~1.71 million), and 'COVID-19 Cohort' which includes healthcare encounters and COVID-19 diagnosis information for all individuals who were tested for COVID-19 (n=~3.41 million). The PLWH will be matched with a comparison group of non-PLWH by the propensity score matching method. To distinguish the role of immunity level in affecting the vaccine effectiveness, we will conduct subgroup analyses to compare the outcome of virally controlled and immunosuppressed PLWH with non-PLWH. Conditional logistic regression and generalised linear models will be employed to analyse the relationship between HIV status and protection durability by adjusting for potential confounders. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of South Carolina (Pro00117583) as a Non-Human Subject study. The study's findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated at national and international conferences and through social media.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1136/bmjopen-2022-067095,*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;COVID-19 Testing;COVID-19 Vaccines/therapeutic use;Cohort Studies;*HIV Infections/complications/epidemiology;Humans;SARS-CoV-2;South Carolina/epidemiology;Vaccine Efficacy;Vaccination;Vaccines,35998950,PMC9402448

However, daily vaccination rates have declined approximately 78% since April 13, 2021(†); vaccine safety concerns have contributed to vaccine hesitancy (4). A cohort study of 19,625 nursing home residents found that those who received an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) had lower all-cause mortality than did unvaccinated residents (5), but no studies comparing mortality rates within the general population of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons have been conducted. To assess mortality not associated with COVID-19 (non-COVID-19 mortality) after COVID-19 vaccination in a general population setting, a cohort study was conducted during December 2020-July 2021 among approximately 11 million persons enrolled in seven Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) sites.(§) After standardizing mortality rates by age and sex, this study found that COVID-19 vaccine recipients had lower non-COVID-19 mortality than did unvaccinated persons. After adjusting for demographic characteristics and VSD site, this study found that adjusted relative risk (aRR) of non-COVID-19 mortality for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 0.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38-0.44) after dose 1 and 0.34 (95% CI = 0.33-0.36) after dose 2.

The aRR after receipt of the Janssen vaccine was 0.54 (95% CI = 0.49-0.59). There is no increased risk for mortality among COVID-19 vaccine recipients.

However, the impact of vaccination on Omicron remained uncertain. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to explore the effect of vaccination on patients infected with Omicron. METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort was conducted in the largest Fangcang shelter hospital in Shanghai from April 1 to May 30, 2022. The demographics, length of hospital stay, clinical symptoms, the comorbidities and vaccination status were recorded. Clinical outcomes of the vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 3,119 patients who fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were enrolled in the study, 2,226 (71.4%) patients had received nCoV-19 vaccine while 893 (28.6%) patients had not received it before admission. Patients in the vaccinated group had significantly shorter length of hospital stay than those in the unvaccinated group (15.48 ± 2.708 vs. 15.85 ± 3.102, p < 0.001). More asymptomatic patients were observed in the vaccinated group than the non-vaccinated (70.4 vs. 64.5%, p < 0.001). Further subgroup analysis demonstrated that the older the age, the more significant the difference was (p < 0.005).

In the United States, the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine is currently authorized for use in children and adolescents aged 5-15 years under an Emergency Use Authorization and is fully licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for persons aged ≥16 years (4). Prelicensure randomized trials in persons aged ≥5 years documented high vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity (5),(§) and real-world studies in persons aged 12-18 years demonstrated high vaccine effectiveness (VE) against severe COVID-19 (6). Recent evidence suggests that COVID-19 vaccination is associated with lower MIS-C incidence among adolescents (7); however, VE of the 2-dose Pfizer-BioNTech regimen against MIS-C has not been evaluated.

Data were analyzed from June 1, 2021, to April 13, 2022. EXPOSURES: Zip code-level first-dose vaccination rates before the Alpha and Delta waves of COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was deaths from COVID-19 during the Alpha and Delta waves. The association of a marginal increase in zip code-level vaccination rate with weekly mortality rates was estimated with a mixed-effects Poisson regression model, and the total number of preventable deaths in the least vaccinated quartile of zip codes was estimated with a linear difference-in-difference design. RESULTS: The study population was 2 686 355 Chicago residents in 52 zip codes (median [IQR] age 34 [32-38] years; 1 378 658 [51%] women; 773 938 Hispanic residents [29%]; 783 916 non-Hispanic Black residents [29%]; 894 555 non-Hispanic White residents [33%]). Among residents in the least vaccinated quartile, 80% were non-Hispanic Black, compared with 8% of residents identifying as non-Hispanic Black in the most vaccinated quartile (P < .001). After controlling for age distribution and recovery from COVID-19, a 10-percentage point increase in zip code-level vaccination 6 weeks before the peak of the Alpha wave was associated with a 39% lower relative risk of death from COVID-19 (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.61 [95% CI, 0.52-0.72]). A 10-percentage point increase in zip code vaccination rate 6 weeks before the peak of the Delta wave was associated with a 24% lower relative risk of death (IRR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.66-0.87]).

We conducted a retrospective cohort study to determine real-world BBIBP-CorV vaccine effectiveness (VE) against serious or critical hospitalization of individuals RT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the first five months of BBIBP-CorV use in Morocco. METHODS: The study was conducted among adults 18-99 years old who were tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1 February and 30 June 2021. RT-PCR results were individually linked with outcomes from the COVID-19 severe or critical hospitalization dataset and with vaccination histories from the national vaccination registration system. Individuals with partial vaccination (< 2 weeks after dose two) or in receipt of any other COVID-19 vaccine were excluded. Unadjusted and adjusted VE estimates against hospitalization for serious or critical illness were made by comparing two-dose vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in logistic regression models, calculated as (1-odds ratio) * 100%. RESULTS: There were 348,190 individuals able to be matched across the three databases. Among these, 140,892 were fully vaccinated, 206,149 were unvaccinated, and 1,149 received homologous BBIBP-CorV booster doses. Unadjusted, full-series, unboosted BBIBP-CorV VE against hospitalization for serious or critical illness was 90.2% (95%CI: 87.8-92.0%). Full-series, unboosted VE, adjusted for age, sex, and calendar day of RT-PCR test, was 88.5% (95%CI: 85.8-90.7%). Calendar day- and sex-adjusted VE was 96.4% (95%CI: 94.6-97.6%) for individuals < 60 years, and was 53.3% (95%CI: 39.6-63.9%) for individuals 60 years and older. There were no serious or critical illnesses among BBIBP-CorV-boosted individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Effectiveness of Sinopharm's BBIBP-CorV was consistent with phase III clinical trial results. Two doses of BBIBP-CorV was highly protective against COVID-19-associated serious or critical hospitalization in working-age adults under real-world conditions and moderately effective in older adults.

This study compared protection afforded by booster doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines, compared to the primary series of only two doses in Qatar, during a large, rapidly growing Omicron wave. METHODS: In a population of 2,232,224 vaccinated persons with at least two doses, two matched, retrospective cohort studies were implemented to investigate effectiveness of booster vaccination against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and against COVID-19 hospitalization and death, up to January 9, 2022.

The adjusted hazard ratio for symptomatic infection was 0.49 (95% CI: 0.43-0.57). Booster effectiveness relative to primary series was 50.8% (95% CI: 43.4-57.3%). There were fewer cases of severe COVID-19 in booster-dose cohorts than in primary-series cohorts, but cases of severe COVID-19 were rare in all cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: mRNA booster vaccination is associated with modest effectiveness against symptomatic infection with Omicron. The development of a new generation of vaccines targeting a broad range of variants may be warranted.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.01.18.22269452     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.01.18.22269452&atitle=Effectiveness+of+BNT162b2+and+mRNA-1273+COVID-19+boosters+against+SARS-CoV-2+Omicron+%28B.1.1.529%29+infection+in+Qatar&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Abu-Raddad&aufirst=Laith+J.&auinit=L.J.&aufull=Abu-Raddad+L.J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=L&auinitm=J,"adult;breakthrough infection;cohort analysis;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;female;follow up;hospitalization;human;immunity;incidence;major clinical study;male;nonhuman;Qatar;retrospective study;revaccination;SARS-CoV-2 Omicron;vaccinee;elasomeran;messenger RNA;tozinameran;RNA, Messenger",,

Abu-Raddad, Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Cornell University, Doha, Qatar","BACKGROUND: In early 2021, Qatar launched a mass immunization campaign with Moderna's mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine. We assessed persistence of real-world mRNA-1273 effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection and against COVID-19 hospitalization and death. METHODS: Effectiveness was estimated using test-negative, case-control study design, between January 1 and December 5, 2021. Effectiveness was estimated against documented infection (a PCR-positive swab, regardless symptoms), and against any severe (acute-care hospitalization), critical (ICU hospitalization), or fatal COVID-19. RESULTS: By December 5, 2021, 2,962 breakthrough infections had been recorded among those who received two mRNA-1273 doses. Of these infections, 19 progressed to severe COVID-19 and 4 to critical, but none to fatal disease. mRNA-1273 effectiveness against infection was negligible for the first two weeks after the first dose, increased to 65.5% (95% CI: 62.7-68.0%) 14 or more days after the first dose, and reached its peak at about 90% in the first three months after the second dose. Effectiveness declined gradually starting from the fourth month after the second dose and was below 50% by the 7th month after the second dose. Effectiveness against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 reached its peak at essentially 100% right after the second dose, and there was no evidence for declining effectiveness over time. Effectiveness against symptomatic versus asymptomatic infection demonstrated the same pattern of waning, but effectiveness against symptomatic infection was consistently higher than that against asymptomatic infection and waned more slowly. CONCLUSIONS: mRNA-1273-induced protection against infection appears to wane month by month after the second dose. Meanwhile, protection against hospitalization and death appears robust with no evidence for waning for several months after the second dose.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1101/2021.12.16.21267902     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2021.12.16.21267902&atitle=Waning+of+mRNA-1273+vaccine+effectiveness+against+SARS-CoV-2+infection+in+Qatar&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Abu-Raddad&aufirst=Laith+J.&auinit=L.J.&aufull=Abu-Raddad+L.J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2021&auinit1=L&auinitm=J,"asymptomatic infection;case control study;comparative effectiveness;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;emergency care;hospitalization;human;polymerase chain reaction;Qatar;elasomeran;RNA, Messenger;Vaccination;Vaccines",,

Alsulaiman, King Fahad University Hospital, Shura Street, Al Aqrabiyah, Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading infection that is on the rise. New variants are continuously appearing with variable degrees of lethality and infectivity. The extensive work since the start of the pandemic has led to the evolution of COVID-19 vaccines with varying mechanisms. We aim to determine real-world data by looking at the different clinical outcomes associated with COVID-19 vaccination, focusing on the rate of hospitalization, severity, and mortality. Methodology: A retrospective observational study included 624 patients with COVID-19 infection who were hospitalized at King Fahad Hospital of the University and King Fahad Military Medical City between April and July 2021. The cohort was divided into 3 groups: unvaccinated, partially vaccinated (PV), and fully vaccinated (FV). The severity and outcome of COVID-19 disease were compared among the three groups. Among the vaccinated group, we studied the effect of vaccine type on the severity and outcome of COVID-19 disease. Results: We found that 70.4% of patients with COVID-19 disease who required hospitalization were unvaccinated. Un-vaccination was a significant predictor of critical COVID-19 disease (OR 2.31; P <0.001), whereas full vaccination was associated with significantly milder disease severity (OR 0.36; P 0.01). Moreover, un-vaccination status was an independent predictor of longer hospitalization (OR 3.0; P <0.001), a higher requirement for ICU admission (OR 4.7; P <0.001), mechanical ventilation (OR 3.6; P <0.001), and death (OR 4.8; P <0.001), whereas the FV group had a lower risk of ICU admission (OR 0.49; P 0.045). Unvaccinated patients with comorbidities had worse severity and outcome of COVID-19 infection (P<0.05). Both vaccine types (Pfizer and AstraZeneca) had similar protective effects against the worst outcomes of COVID-19 disease. Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccination has been shown to be effective in reducing hospitalization, the severity of COVID-19 infection, and improving outcomes, especially in high-risk group patients. COVID-19 vaccination programs should continue to improve the outcome of such a disease.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.2147/IDR.S365179     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=11786973&id=doi:10.2147%2FIDR.S365179&atitle=The+Impact+of+Vaccination+Against+SARS-CoV-2+Virus+on+the+Outcome+of+COVID-19+Disease&stitle=Infect.+Drug+Resist.&title=Infection+and+Drug+Resistance&volume=15&issue=&spage=3477&epage=3489&aulast=Alkhafaji&aufirst=Dania+M.&auinit=D.M.&aufull=Alkhafaji+D.M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=3477-3489&date=2022&auinit1=D&auinitm=M,SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;adult;article;artificial ventilation;clinical outcome;cohort analysis;comorbidity;coronavirus disease 2019;death;disease severity;drug effect;female;hospital admission;hospitalization;human;low risk population;major clinical study;male;mortality;observational study;prediction;retrospective study;treatment outcome;university hospital;vaccination;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

METHODS: Six national, matched, test-negative case-control studies were conducted to estimate effectiveness of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine, mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine, natural immunity due to prior infection with pre-Omicron variants, and hybrid immunity from prior infection and vaccination. RESULTS: Effectiveness of only prior infection against symptomatic BA.2 infection was 46.1% (95% CI: 39.5-51.9%). Effectiveness of only two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was negligible at -1.1% (95% CI: -7.1-4.6), but nearly all individuals had received their second dose several months earlier. Effectiveness of only three-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was 52.2% (95% CI: 48.1-55.9%). Effectiveness of hybrid immunity of prior infection and two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was 55.1% (95% CI: 50.9-58.9%). Effectiveness of hybrid immunity of prior infection and three-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was 77.3% (95% CI: 72.4-81.4%). Meanwhile, prior infection, BNT162b2 vaccination, and hybrid immunity all showed strong effectiveness >70% against any severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 due to BA.2 infection. Similar levels and patterns of effectiveness were observed for BA.1 and for the mRNA-1273 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: There are no discernable differences in the effects of prior infection, vaccination, and hybrid immunity against BA.1 versus BA.2. Hybrid immunity resulting from prior infection and recent booster vaccination confers the strongest protection against either subvariant. Vaccination enhances protection of those with a prior infection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1101/2022.03.22.22272745     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.03.22.22272745&atitle=Effect+of+prior+infection%2C+vaccination%2C+and+hybrid+immunity+against+symptomatic+BA.1+and+BA.2+Omicron+infections+and+severe+COVID-19+in+Qatar&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Altarawneh&aufirst=Heba+N.&auinit=H.N.&aufull=Altarawneh+H.N.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=H&auinitm=N,adult;case control study;case report;clinical article;comparative effectiveness;coronavirus disease 2019;female;human;innate immunity;male;Qatar;reinfection;revaccination;vaccination;elasomeran;tozinameran;Vaccination,,

This study aimed at estimating the effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines on SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19. A retrospective cohort study was carried out on 3,966,976 Sicilian adults aged 18 years or more, who were followed-up from 1 January 2021 to 30 September 2021. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 in-fection, severe COVID-19, and COVID-19 death or intubation during the study period was compared among vaccinated with two mRNA doses and unvaccinated individuals. Cox regression, adjusted for age and sex, and a joint-point analysis on rate trends were performed. Overall, 2,469,320 (62.2%) subjects have been vaccinated and a total of 103,078 (2.6% of the entire population) SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects have been observed including 4693 (0.12%) severe COVID-19, 277 (0.01%) intubated, and 2649 (0.07%) deaths. After two months from vaccination, adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 81.3% against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 96.1% against severe COVID-19, and 93.4% against intubation/death. During the eight-month follow-up, statistically significant decreasing effectiveness trends were observed for all the evaluated outcomes (−4.76% per month against SARS-CoV-2 infection; −2.27% per month against severe COVID-19 and −2.26% per month against COVID-19 intubation/death). The study results confirm that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have high real-world effectiveness, especially in the first months after vaccination. The vaccine effectiveness decreases over time and, even if the decrease is relatively small against severe outcomes, the increasing protection wane suggests the need for booster vaccination campaigns.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.3390/vaccines10030426     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=2076393X&id=doi:10.3390%2Fvaccines10030426&atitle=Effectiveness+of+mRNA+COVID-19+Vaccination+on+SARS-CoV-2+Infection+and+COVID-19+in+Sicily+over+an+Eight-Month+Period&stitle=Vaccines&title=Vaccines&volume=10&issue=3&spage=&epage=&aulast=Amodio&aufirst=Emanuele&auinit=E.&aufull=Amodio+E.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=E&auinitm=,"SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;adult;aged;article;cohort analysis;coronavirus disease 2019;death;drug efficacy;female;follow up;human;intubation;major clinical study;male;retrospective study;vaccination;RNA, Messenger;Vaccination",,

Design: Population-based cohort analyses. Setting: Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, 27 December 2020 to 28 February 2022. Participants: Adults that had received at least a primary vaccination schedule (ie, two doses) of the AZD, BNT, and/or MOD vaccines during the study period. Main outcome measures: Using the Kaplan-Meier estimator, we compared country-specific risks of SARSCoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes in heterologous booster vaccinated with primary schedule vaccinated (matched analyses) and homologous booster vaccinated (weighted analyses) since emergence of omicron. Results: Heterologous booster schedules improved protection against all outcomes compared with primary schedules, with the largest and most robust effects observed for severe COVID-19.

We employed a test-negative design and used multinomial logistic regression on data from community PCR testing in the Netherlands. S-gene target failure (SGTF) was used as proxy to discern Delta, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.2 infections. Two cohorts were defined to assess protection from vaccination and previous infection by variant: Delta-Omicron BA.1 cohort including data from 22 November 2021 to 7 January 2022 (n = 354,653) and Omicron BA.1-BA.2 cohort including data from 26 January to 31 March 2022 (n = 317,110). In the Delta-Omicron BA.1 cohort, including 39,889 Delta and 13,915 Omicron BA.1 infections, previous infection, primary vaccination or both protected well against Delta infection (76%, 71%, 92%, respectively, at 7+ months after infection or vaccination). Protection against Omicron BA.1 was much lower compared to Delta infections, but BA.1 estimates were imprecise. In the Omicron BA.1BA.2 cohort, including 67,887 BA.1 and 41,670 BA.2 infections, protection was similar against Omicron BA.1 compared to BA.2 infection for previous infection (34 and 38% at 7+ months post-infection), primary (39 and 32% at 7+ months post-vaccination) and booster vaccination (68 and 63% at 1 month post-vaccination). Higher protection was observed against all variants in individuals with both vaccination and previous infection compared with either one. Protection against all variants by either vaccination or infection decreased over time since last vaccination or infection. Primary vaccination with current COVID-19 vaccines and previous SARS-CoV-2 infections offer low protection against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 infection. Booster vaccination considerably increases protection against Omicron infection, but decreases rapidly after vaccination.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.02.06.22270457     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.02.06.22270457&atitle=Protection+of+COVID-19+vaccination+and+previous+infection+against+Omicron+BA.1%2C+BA.2+and+Delta+SARS-CoV-2+infections&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Andeweg&aufirst=Stijn+P.&auinit=S.P.&aufull=Andeweg+S.P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=S&auinitm=P,adult;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;hepatitis D;human;Netherlands;revaccination;treatment failure;vaccination;SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;Vaccination,,

However, “depletion of susceptibles” bias driven by differential accrual of infection among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals may contribute to the appearance of waning vaccine effectiveness (VE) in epidemiologic studies, potentially hindering interpretation of estimates. We enrolled California residents who received molecular SARS-CoV-2 tests in a matched, test-negative design case-control study to estimate VE of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines between 23 February and 5 December 2021. We analyzed waning protection following 2 vaccine doses using conditional logistic regression models. Additionally, we used data from case-based surveillance along with estimated case-to-infection ratios from a population-based serological study to quantify the potential contribution of the “depletion-of-susceptibles” bias to time-varying VE estimates for 2 doses. We also estimated VE for 3 doses relative to 0 doses and 2 doses, by time since second dose receipt. Pooled VE of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was 91.3% (95% confidence interval: 83.8-95.4%) at 14 days after second-dose receipt and declined to 50.8% (31.2-75.6%) at 7 months. Accounting for differential depletion-of-susceptibles among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, we estimated VE was 53.2% (23.6-71.2%) at 7 months among individuals who had completed the primary series (2 doses). With receipt of a third dose of BN162b2 or mRNA-1273, VE increased to 95.0% (82.8-98.6%), compared with zero doses. These findings confirm that observed waning of protection is not attributable to epidemiologic bias and support ongoing efforts to administer additional vaccine doses to mitigate burden of COVID-19.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1101/2022.06.03.22275958     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.06.03.22275958&atitle=Waning+of+two-dose+BNT162b2+and+mRNA-1273+vaccine+effectiveness+against+symptomatic+SARSCoV-2+infection+is+robust+to+depletion-of-susceptibles+bias&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Andrejko&aufirst=Kristin+L.&auinit=K.L.&aufull=Andrejko+K.L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=K&auinitm=L,"adult;case control study;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;female;human;male;elasomeran;tozinameran;RNA, Messenger;Vaccination;Bias (Epidemiology);Vaccines",,

Two doses of BBIBP-CorV vaccine are recommended, 21 days apart. Data on BBIBP-CorV vaccine effectiveness will inform the use and acceptance of vaccination with BBIBP-CorV vaccine. We evaluated BBIBP-CorV vaccine effectiveness among an existing multi-year influenza cohort at two hospitals in Lima. We analyzed data on 290 participants followed between February and May 2021. Participants completed a baseline questionnaire and provided weekly self-collected anterior nasal swabs tested for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR for sixteen weeks. We performed multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for pre-selected characteristics (age, sex, exposure to COVID-19 patients, work in intensive care unit or emergency department, BMI, and exposure time in days). BBIBP-CorV vaccine effectiveness was calculated after the two-week post-vaccination period as (1-Odds Ratio for testing SARS-CoV-2 positive)x100%. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by rRT-PCR among 25 (9%) participants during follow-up (February-May 2021). Follow-up period ranged 1-11 weeks (median: 2 weeks). Among cohort participants who were fully vaccinated the adjusted vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated as 95% (95% CI: 70%, 99%) and 100% (95% CI: 88%, 100%) for those partially vaccinated. During the study period, vaccination of healthcare personnel with BBIBP-CorV vaccine was effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections in the weeks immediately following vaccination.

The clinical trials behind these approvals did not test vaccines in immunocompromised patients nor stratify patients with various comorbidities. Therefore, the aim was to compare adverse outcomes in vaccinated patients with and without psoriasis. Design: A retrospective analysis was conducted using TriNetX, a real-time multicenter database, from December 2020-May 2021. A 1:1 matched propensity score analysis was conducted, adjusting for comorbidities and demographics, to generate adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) with 95% CI. Outcomes included breakthrough COVID infections, 1-day anaphylaxis, 30- and 60-day follow-up for all-cause hospitalization, and FDA-defined adverse events of special interest (AESI). Subgroup analysis was also conducted for those with a 1-year history of methotrexate or TNF inhibitor use. Summary: From the 904,952 patients who received a COVID-19 vaccine, 1.1% had psoriasis. After matching, there were no differences between cohorts for 1-day anaphylaxis or for 30- and 60-day all-cause hospitalization or AESIs. However, vaccinated psoriatic patients were at a higher risk for new COVID infection in 30-day (RR = 2.67 [1.6-4.5]) and 60-day follow up (RR = 2.09 [1.4-3.2]). Subgroup analysis revealed no difference in any assessed outcomes for those with a 1-year history of methotrexate or TNF inhibitors. Conclusion: These results show that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective for psoriatic patients. Although breakthrough infection had a higher risk in the psoriatic cohort, the overall prevalence was still <0.6%. Further research is warranted to study the impacts of vaccination on psoriatic patients, especially in more severe forms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1016/j.jaad.2022.06.456     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=10976787&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.jaad.2022.06.456&atitle=35304+Safety+and+efficacy+of+COVID-19+vaccination+in+psoriasis+patients&stitle=J.+Am.+Acad.+Dermatol.&title=Journal+of+the+American+Academy+of+Dermatology&volume=87&issue=3&spage=AB106&epage=&aulast=Baker&aufirst=Mairead&auinit=M.&aufull=Baker+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=AB106-&date=2022&auinit1=M&auinitm=,methotrexate;SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;tumor necrosis factor inhibitor;adult;adverse outcome;anaphylaxis;breakthrough infection;clinical assessment;clinical trial;cohort analysis;comorbidity;conference abstract;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;demographics;drug safety;drug therapy;female;follow up;hospitalization;human;major clinical study;male;multicenter study;outcome assessment;prevalence;propensity score;psoriasis;retrospective study;vaccination;vaccinee;Vaccination;Psoriasis,,

We undertook a study to determine if recent reports of waning for severe disease could have been attributed to design-related bias by conducting a study only among those detected with a first SARS-CoV-2 infection. We used a matched case-control study design with the study base being all individuals with first infection with SARS-CoV-2 reported in the State of Qatar between 1 January 2021 and 20 February 2022. Cases were those detected with first SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring intensive care (hard outcome), while controls were those detected with first SARS-CoV-2 infection who recovered without the need for intensive care. Cases and controls were matched in a 1:30 ratio for the calendar month of infection and the comorbidity category. Duration and magnitude of conditional vaccine effectiveness against requiring intensive care and the number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent one more case of COVID-19 requiring intensive care was estimated for the mRNA (BNT162b2/mRNA-1273) vaccines. Conditional vaccine effectiveness against requiring intensive care was 59% (95% confidence interval (CI), 50 to 76) between the first and second dose, and strengthened to 89% (95% CI, 85 to 92) between the second dose and 4 months post the second dose in persons who received a primary course of the vaccine. There was no waning of vaccine effectiveness in the period from 4 to 6, 6 to 9, and 9 to 12 months after the second dose. This study demonstrates that, contrary to mainstream reports using hierar-chical measures of effectiveness, conditional vaccine effectiveness against requiring intensive care remains robust till at least 12 months after the second dose of mRNA-based vaccines.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: case-control",10.3390/vaccines10071036     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=2076393X&id=doi:10.3390%2Fvaccines10071036&atitle=Duration+of+COVID-19+mRNA+Vaccine+Effectiveness+against+Severe+Disease&stitle=Vaccines&title=Vaccines&volume=10&issue=7&spage=&epage=&aulast=Bansal&aufirst=Devendra&auinit=D.&aufull=Bansal+D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=D&auinitm=,"chadox1;elasomeran;SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;tozinameran;vaxzevria;adult;article;cardiovascular disease;case control study;cerebrovascular disease;chronic obstructive lung disease;cohort analysis;coronavirus disease 2019;COVID-19 testing;diabetes mellitus;drug efficacy;female;human;hypertension;immunization;intensive care;liver disease;major clinical study;male;nasopharyngeal swab;obesity;Qatar;real time polymerase chain reaction;reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;RNA, Messenger;Vaccination;Vaccines",,

However, compared to other vaccines used across the globe, the realworld data on the effectiveness of GamCOVIDVac, especially against the disease caused by Delta variant of concern, was not available. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of vaccination mainly conducted with GamCOVIDVac in St. Petersburg, Russia. Methods: We designed a casecontrol study to assess the vaccine effectiveness (VE) against lung injury and referral to hospital. Selfreported vaccination status was collected for individuals with confirmed SARSCoV2 infection who were referred for initial lowdose computed tomography triage in two outpatient centres in July 3 - August 9, 2021 in St. Petersburg, Russia. We used logistic regression models to estimate the adjusted (for age, sex, and triage centre) VE for complete (>14 days after the second dose) vaccination. We estimated the VE against referral for hospital admission, COVID19related lung injury assessed with LDCT, and decline in oxygen saturation. Results: In the final analysis, 13,893 patients were included, 1,291 (9.3%) of patients met our criteria for complete vaccination status, and 495 (3.6%) were referred to hospital. In the primary analysis, the adjusted VE against referral to hospital was 81% (95% CI: 68-88) for complete vaccination. The VE against referral to hospital was more pronounced in women (84%, 95% CI: 66-92) compared to men (76%, 95% CI: 51-88). Vaccine protective effect increased with increasing lung injury categories, from 54% (95% CI: 48-60) against any sign of lung injury to 76% (95% CI: 59-86) against more than 50% lung involvement. A sharp increase was observed in the probability of hospital admission with age for nonvaccinated patients in relation to an almost flat relationship for the completely vaccinated group. Conclusions: COVID19 vaccination was effective against referral to hospital in patients with symptomatic SARSCoV2 infection in St. Petersburg, Russia. This protection is probably mediated through VE against lung injury associated with COVID19.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: case-control",10.1101/2021.08.18.21262065     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2021.08.18.21262065&atitle=Vaccine+Effectiveness+against+Referral+to+Hospital+and+Severe+Lung+Injury+Associated+with+COVID-19%3A+A+Case-Control+Study+in+St.+Petersburg%2C+Russia&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Barchuk&aufirst=Anton&auinit=A.&aufull=Barchuk+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2021&auinit1=A&auinitm=,adult;adverse drug reaction;clinical trial;comparative effectiveness;computer assisted tomography;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;emergency health service;female;hospital admission;hospital based case control study;human;lung injury;major clinical study;male;multicenter study;outpatient;oxygen saturation;patient referral;probability;Russian Federation;side effect;vaccination;vaccine;Case-Control Studies;Vaccination;Referral and Consultation;Vaccines;Lung,,

The elderly are highly vulnerable to severe Covid-19. Waning immunity and emergence of Omicron have caused concerns about reduced effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines. The objective was to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against severe Covid-19 among the elderly. Methods. This nationwide, register-based cohort analysis included all residents aged 70 years and over in Finland. The follow-up started on December 27, 2020, and ended on March 31, 2022. The outcomes of interest were Covid-19-related hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission timely associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. VE was estimated as one minus the hazard ratio comparing the vaccinated and unvaccinated and taking into account time since vaccination. Omicron-specific VE was evaluated as the effectiveness observed since January 1, 2022. Results. The cohort included 896220 individuals. Comirnaty (BioNTech/Pfizer) VE against Covid-19-related hospitalization was 93% (95% CI 89%–95%) and 85% (95% CI 82%–87%) 14–90 and 91–180 days after the second dose; VE increased to 95% (95% CI 94%–96%) 14–60 days after the third dose. VE of other homologous and heterologous three dose series was similar. Protection against severe Covid-19 requiring ICU treatment was even better. Since January 1, 2022, Comirnaty VE was 98% (95% CI 92%–99%) and 92% (95% CI 87%–95%) 14–90 and 91–180 days after the second and 98% (95% CI 95%–99%) 14–60 days after the third dose. Conclusions. VE against severe Covid-19 is high among the elderly. It waned slightly after two doses, but a third restored the protection.

However, estimation of vaccine effectiveness (VE) is still unavailable for some widely used vaccines and underrepresented groups. Here, we report on the effectiveness of a nationwide COVID-19 vaccination program in Mexico. METHODS: We used a test-negative design within a national COVID-19 surveillance system to assess VE of the BNT162b2, mRNA-12732, Gam-COVID-Vac, Ad5-nCoV, Ad26.COV2.S, ChAdOx1 and CoronaVac vaccines, against SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related hospitalization and death for adults ≥18 years in Mexico. VE was estimated using Cox proportional hazard models considering time-varying vaccination status in partial and fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated adults, adjusted by age, sex, comorbidities and municipality. We also estimated VE for adults ≥60 years, for cases with diabetes and comparing periods with predominance of variants B.1.1.519 and B.1.617.2. RESULTS: We assessed 793,487 vaccinated compared to 4,792,338 unvaccinated adults between December 24th, 2020, and September 27th, 2021. VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection was highest for fully vaccinated individuals with mRNA-12732 (91.5%, 95%CI 90.3-92.4) and Ad26.COV2.S (82.2%, 95%CI 81.4-82.9), whereas for COVID-19 related hospitalization were BNT162b2 (84.3%, 95%CI 83.6-84.9) and Gam-COVID-Vac (81.4% 95%CI 79.5-83.1) and for mortality BNT162b2 (89.8%, 95%CI 89.2-90.2) and mRNA-12732 (93.5%, 95%CI 86.0-97.0). VE for all evaluated vaccines was reduced for adults ≥60 years, people with diabetes, and in periods of Delta variant predominance. CONCLUSIONS: All evaluated vaccines were effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related hospitalization and death.

Since patients with immune-mediated conditions were excluded from clinical trials, it is important to describe real-world data regarding vaccine effectiveness. In this population-based study, we used our large validated, comprehensive coeliac disease autoimmunity (CDA) patients cohort, based on their anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA level, to explore the effectiveness of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We conducted a large population-based cohort study in Maccabi healthcare services (MHS), a 2.5 million-member health organization operating in Israel. In the primary analysis, the cohort included all patients with validated CDA who were fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with matched patients based on birth year, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), and month of first vaccine dose in a 1:3 ratio. The study included vaccinated patients age ≥12 years with CDA with a minimum of two BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses. Patients with CDA were then divided into subgroups based on their positive tTG-IgA level at diagnosis and their current status based on the last tTG-IgA results within the last two years. Patients with anti-tTG IgA, more than 10 times the upper limit of the normal range, were considered patients with near-certain coeliac disease. Kaplan Meier survival analyses were performed to evaluate time to breakthrough infection with SARSCoV-2, defined as a positive PCR result 14 days post-second vaccination date. Patients with CDA and their matched patients were compared via the Log-rank test. Multivariate cox regression analyses and hazard ratio assessment with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: In this study 7,083 patients with CDA were identified in the MHS database with two confirmed COVID-19 vaccinations and no prior record of a positive PCR test. After matching, there were 5,381 patients with CDA matched to 14,939 patients without any record of tTG-IgA testing. The mean age in years for the CDA and matched patients was 33.38 (17.78) and 33.93 (17.68), respectively. Vaccine effectiveness was evaluated with Kaplan Meier survival analysis among the full cohort (CDA n=5,381 and matched patients n=14,939) to evaluate time to breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection, where there was no observed statistical difference between groups (p=0.71, Figure 1). A Cox regression survival analysis was performed with the cohort, where the hazard ratio for breakthrough infection among CDA patients was 0.91 (95% CI = 0.77, 1.09). The same models were applied, and similar results were obtained for patients with near-certain coeliac disease, well-controlled patients with CDA, likely not well-controlled patients with CDA, and newly diagnosed patients with CDA. Conclusions: In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first reports of real-world COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in patients with CDA.

Design: Population-based cohort study using national, linked Census and administrative data. Setting: England, United Kingdom, from 8th December 2020 to 31st August 2021. Participants: 815,4777 women aged 18 to 45 years (mean age, 30.4 years) who had documented evidence of a first SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHS Test and Trace data or Hospital Episode Statistics. Main outcome measures: A hospital inpatient episode where COVID-19 was recorded as the primary diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for calendar time of infection and sociodemographic factors related to vaccine uptake and risk of severe COVID-19, were used to estimate VE as the complement of the hazard ratio for COVID-19 hospital admission. Results: Compared with unvaccinated pregnant women, the adjusted rate of COVID-19 hospital admission was 76% (95% confidence interval 69% to 82%) lower for single-vaccinated pregnant women and 83% (75% to 88%) lower for double-vaccinated pregnant women. These estimates were similar to those found for non-pregnant women: 79% (76% to 81%) for single-vaccinated and 82% (80% to 83%) for double-vaccinated. Among those vaccinated more than 90 days before infection, being double-vaccinated was associated with a greater reduction in risk than being single-vaccinated. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccination is associated with reduced rates of severe illness in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the reduction in risk is similar to that for non-pregnant women.

However, a matter of concern remains the effectiveness of Sars-Cov2 vaccine in patients with immune mediated disease and concomitant biological and/or immunosoppressive treatments. Aims & Methods: Our aim was to evaluate the rate of new infections, symptomatic or asymptomatic, after full mRNA SARS-CoV2 vaccination, including a third dose, in a homogeneous cohort of patients with IBD followed up in a tertiary referral center from southern Italy. The relationships with disease characteristics and concomitant therapies were also assessed. Data were collected between 03/2021 and 03/2022. Most patients receveid the third dose of SARS-CoV2 vaccine between 11/2021 and 01/2022. IBD type, disease features (location, behaviour, extra intestinal manifestations), biologic therapy, immunosoppressive treatment, previous surgery, smoking habit, comorbidities and vaccination protocol were analysed. Results: Our cohort is composed of 108 patients with IBD, 52 CD and 56 UC, mean age 53,67 years, 58 pts were on biological therapy. 25/108 patients developed COVID-19 infection (23 %), 7/25 patients (28%) didn't receive the third dose because contracted the infection before the booster dose. There was a significant difference in the rate of infection between those who received the third dose and those who did not (p<0,001). The COVID-19 population was younger (48,6 ± 16,5) than the non COVID-19 population (55,2 ± 15,9, p=0,07) and female sex was more frequent (56% vs 36%, p=0,1). 19/25 (76 %) had symptomatic infection (flu-like symptoms) but none of them experienced pneumonia or severe disease. Symptomatic infection was more frequent in patients who didn't complete the vaccination protocol (68,42% VS 83,33%), though the difference was not significant. Biological therapy was not associated with the development of infection either symptomatic or asymptomatic. Smoking habit, comorbidity, type of IBD, were not significantly related to COVID-19. Conclusion: Our results confirm the effectiveness of mRNA SARS-CoV2 vaccination in patients with IBD independently from concomitant immunosuppressive therapy since only 23% of them developed the infection, most with mild symptoms. The protective effect was statistically significant in those who received the booster dose. The need of additional doses iin IBD patients on biologics will be a matter of debate.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1002/ueg2.12290     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=20506414&id=doi:10.1002%2Fueg2.12290&atitle=EFFECTIVENESS+OF+SARS-COV2+BOOSTER+VACCINATION+IN+PATIENTS+WITH+INFLAMMATORY+BOWEL+DISEASE+%28IBD%29%3A+PRELIMINARY+REPORT+FROM+A+SINGLE+REFERRAL+CENTER+IN+SOUTHERN+ITALY&stitle=United+Eur.+Gastroenterol.+J.&title=United+European+Gastroenterology+Journal&volume=10&issue=&spage=640&epage=&aulast=Brinch&aufirst=D.&auinit=D.&aufull=Brinch+D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=640-&date=2022&auinit1=D&auinitm=,messenger RNA;SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;adult;cohort analysis;comorbidity;conference abstract;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;enteropathy;female;flu like syndrome;human;immunosuppressive treatment;infection rate;inflammatory bowel disease;Italy;major clinical study;middle aged;nonhuman;observational study;patient history of surgery;patient referral;pneumonia;revaccination;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;smoking habit;tertiary care center;vaccination;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Referral and Consultation;Vaccination,,

We estimated 2-dose and 3-dose VE against Omicron and Delta in adolescents aged 12-17 years in Ontario, Canada. Methods We conducted a test-negative design study among SARS-CoV-2-tested adolescents aged 12-17 years between November 22, 2021 (date of first Omicron detection) and March 6, 2022; we assessed Delta outcomes prior to January 2, 2022. We used multivariable logistic regression to compare the odds of vaccination in cases to symptomatic test-negative controls and calculated VE as 1-adjusted odds ratio. Results VE was lower against symptomatic Omicron infection than against Delta and decreased more rapidly over time, from 51% (95%CI, 38-61%) in the 7-59 days following a second dose to 29% (95%CI, 17-38%) after 180 days, compared to 97% (95%CI, 94-99%) and 90% (95%CI, 79-95%) for the same intervals against symptomatic Delta infection. Overall, 2-dose VE against severe outcomes caused by Omicron was 85% (95%CI, 74-91%) ≥7 days following a second dose and estimates were similar over time. VE against symptomatic Omicron infection was 62% (95%CI, 49-72%) ≥7 days following a third dose. Discussion Two-dose VE against symptomatic Omicron infection wanes over time in adolescents. While lower than observed against Delta, protection against severe outcomes appears to be maintained over time. A third dose substantially improves protection against Omicron infection, but 3-dose VE is only moderate at approximately 60% in the early period following vaccination and the duration of this protection is unknown.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1101/2022.04.07.22273319     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.04.07.22273319&atitle=Vaccine+effectiveness+of+BNT162b2+against+Omicron+and+Delta+outcomes+in+adolescents&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Buchan&aufirst=Sarah+A.&auinit=S.A.&aufull=Buchan+S.A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=S&auinitm=A,adolescent;child;clinical assessment;controlled study;drug therapy;hepatitis D;human;low drug dose;nonhuman;outcome assessment;school child;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;tozinameran;Adolescent;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

Due to severe outcomes, elderly adults 60 years or older are prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination but accumulated SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination likely modifies their risk. We estimated vaccine effectiveness against omicron-associated hospitalisation among elderly adults, by number of doses, prior infection history and time since last immunological event. Methods. We conducted a test-negative case-control study among symptomatic elderly adults tested for SARS-CoV-2 in Quebec, Canada during BA.1-, BA.2- and BA.4/5dominant periods. Relative to unvaccinated, infection-naïve participants, we compared COVID-19 hospitalisation risk by mRNA vaccine dose and/or prior infection (pre-omicron or omicron) history. Findings. During BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/5 periods, two- vs. four-dose vaccine effectiveness alone against hospitalisation was: 78% (95%CI:75-80) vs. 96% (95%CI:93-98); 60% (95%CI:50-97) vs. 84% (95%CI:81-87); and 40% (95%CI:30-49) vs. 68% (95%CI:63-72), respectively, consistent with longer median time since second vs fourth dose. By respective period, effectiveness of pre-omicron vs. omicron infection alone against hospitalisation was: 93% (95%CI:80-97) vs. [not estimable]; 88% (95%CI:50-97) vs. 96% (95%CI:68-99); and 69% (95%CI:30-85) vs. 90% (95%CI:79-95). Regardless of doses (2-5) or prior infection type, hybrid protection was ≥90%, lasting at least 6-8 months during the BA.4/5 period. Prior omicron infection alone reduced BA.4/5 hospitalisation risk by >80% for at least 6-8 months. Interpretation. Elderly adults with history of both prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and ≥2 vaccine doses appear well-protected for a prolonged period against omicron hospitalisation, including BA.4/5. Ensuring infection-naïve older adults remain up-to-date with vaccination may further reduce COVID-19 hospitalisations most efficiently. Funding.

We estimated the protection against the Omicron BA.2 variant associated with prior primary infection (PI) due to pre-Omicron or Omicron BA.1 virus, with and without mRNA vaccination. Methods. A test-negative case-control study was conducted among healthcare workers (HCWs) tested for SARS-CoV-2 in Quebec, Canada, between March 27 and June 4, 2022, when BA.2 predominated and was presumptively diagnosed. Logistic regression models compared the likelihood of BA.2 reinfection (second positive test ≥30 days after PI) among HCWs with history of PI and none to three doses of mRNA vaccine versus infection-naïve, unvaccinated HCWs. Findings. Among 37,732 presumed BA.2 cases, 2,521 (6.7%) and 659 (1.7%) were reinfections following pre-Omicron or BA.1 PI, respectively. Among 73,507 controls, 7,360 (10.0%) and 12,315 (16.8%) had a pre-Omicron or BA.1 PI, respectively. Pre-Omicron PI was associated with 38% (95%CI:19-53) reduction in BA.2 infection risk, with higher BA.2 protection among those also vaccinated with one (56%), two (69%) or three (70%) vaccine doses. Omicron BA.1 PI was associated with greater protection against BA.2 (72%; 95%CI:65-78), higher among two-dose vaccinated at 96% (95%CI:95-96) but not improved with a third dose (96%; 95%CI:95-97). Hybrid Omicron BA.1 PI plus two or three dose vaccine-induced protection persisted for five months post-infection. Interpretation. Twice-vaccinated individuals who experienced BA.1 infection were subsequently well-protected for a prolonged period against BA.2 reinfection and derived no meaningful added benefit against BA.2 from a third dose of mRNA vaccine.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1101/2022.06.23.22276824     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.06.23.22276824&atitle=Protection+against+Omicron+BA.2+reinfection+conferred+by+primary+Omicron+or+pre-Omicron+infection+with+and+without+mRNA+vaccination&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Carazo&aufirst=Sara&auinit=S.&aufull=Carazo+S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=S&auinitm=,"adult;Canada;case control study;case report;clinical article;drug megadose;female;health care personnel;human;infection risk;male;nonhuman;primary infection;Quebec;reinfection;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;messenger RNA;RNA vaccine;RNA, Messenger;Vaccination",,

Design. Test-negative study between December 26 (epi-week 52), 2021 and March 12 (epi-week 10), 2022. Setting. Population-based, province of Quebec, Canada Participants. Community-dwelling ≥12-year-olds tested for SARS-CoV-2. Exposures. Prior laboratory-confirmed infection with/without mRNA vaccination. Outcomes. Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 re-infection and hospitalization, presumed Omicron by genomic surveillance. The odds of prior non-Omicron infection with/without vaccination were compared among Omicron cases/hospitalizations versus test-negative controls (single randomly-selected per individual). Adjusted odds ratios controlled for age, sex, testing-indication and epi-week. Analyses were stratified by severity and time since last non-Omicron infection or vaccine dose. Results. Without vaccination, prior non-Omicron infection reduced the Omicron re-infection risk by 44% (95%CI:38-48), decreasing from 66% (95%CI:57-73) at 3-5 months to 35% (95%CI:21-47) at 9-11 months post-infection and <30% thereafter. The more severe the prior infection, the greater the risk reduction: 8% (95%CI:17-28), 43% (95%CI:37-49) and 68% (95%CI:51-80) for prior asymptomatic, symptomatic ambulatory or hospitalized infections. mRNA vaccine effectiveness against Omicron infection was consistently significantly higher among previously-infected vs. non-infected individuals at 65% (95%CI:63-67) vs. 20% (95%CI:16-24) for one-dose; 68% (95%CI:67-70) vs. 42% (95%CI:41-44) for two doses; and 83% (95%CI:81-84) vs. 73% (95%CI:72-73) for three doses. Infection-induced protection against Omicron hospitalization was 81% (95%CI: 66-89) increasing to 86% (95%CI:77-99) with one, 94% (95%CI:91-96) with two and 97%(95%CI:94-99) with three mRNA vaccine doses. Two-dose effectiveness against hospitalization among previously-infected individuals did not wane across 11 months and did not significantly differ from three-dose effectiveness despite longer follow-up (median 158 and 27 days, respectively). Conclusions and relevance. Prior heterologous SARS-CoV-2 infection provided substantial and sustained protection against Omicron hospitalization, greatest among those also vaccinated. In the context of program goals to prevent severe outcomes and preserve healthcare system capacity, >2 doses of ancestral Wuhan-like vaccine may be of marginal incremental value to previously-infected individuals.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1101/2022.04.29.22274455     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.04.29.22274455&atitle=Protection+against+Omicron+re-infection+conferred+by+prior+heterologous+SARS-CoV-2+infection%2C+with+and+without+mRNA+vaccination&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Carazo&aufirst=Sara&auinit=S.&aufull=Carazo+S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=S&auinitm=,"adult;Canada;community dwelling person;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;female;follow up;health care system;hospitalization;human;infection risk;male;nonhuman;Quebec;reinfection;risk reduction;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;messenger RNA;RNA vaccine;RNA, Messenger;Vaccination",,

Castillo, DREES, Statistics office of the French Ministry for Solidarity and Health, Paris, France","Background SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread despite fast vaccine rollout, which could be attributed to waning immunity or to a reduced protection against some variants. A thorough characterization of vaccine protection and its duration in time is needed to inform vaccination policies and enhance public trust. Methods We matched three national databases with exhaustive information on screening, vaccination and hospitalizations in France over the year 2021. We performed a two-step analysis to estimate vaccine effectiveness against severe forms of Covid-19 in people aged 50 years or over, combining: (i) a test-negative case-control design to assess vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infections; and (ii) a survival analysis to assess the additional protection against severe outcomes (hospitalizations and inpatient deaths) in infected individuals. Results We found a high vaccine effectiveness in people aged 50 years or more, reaching 82% against symptomatic infections and 94% against severe outcomes, after a full vaccination scheme. Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infections strongly decreased over time, dropping to 53% after six months, but remained high against severe forms (90% after six months). The booster dose allowed restoring high protection levels. Vaccine protection and its evolution in time, showed little difference against the variants that circulated prior to December 2021 in France, including the Delta variant. Conclusion Though vaccine immunity decreases over time, vaccination remains crucial to provide individual protection against severe diseases. This decline can be reversed by the injection of a booster dose.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1101/2022.02.17.22270791     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.02.17.22270791&atitle=Vaccine+effectiveness+and+duration+of+protection+against+symptomatic+and+severe+Covid-19+during+the+first+year+of+vaccination+in+France&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Castillo&aufirst=Milena+Suarez&auinit=M.S.&aufull=Castillo+M.S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=M&auinitm=S,adult;comparative effectiveness;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;France;hospitalization;human;immunity;in-hospital mortality;middle aged;nonhuman;outcome assessment;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;survival analysis;vaccination;vaccine;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

Methods: A national, matched, retrospective, target trial cohort study was conducted in Qatar to investigate effectiveness of a third mRNA (booster) dose, relative to a primary series of two doses, against SARS-CoV-2 omicron infection and against severe COVID-19. Associations were estimated using Cox proportional-hazards regression models. Results: Booster effectiveness relative to primary series was 41.1% (95% CI: 40.0-42.1%) against infection and 80.5% (95% CI: 55.7-91.4%) against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19, over one-year follow-up after the booster. Among persons clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19, effectiveness was 49.7% (95% CI: 47.8-51.6%) against infection and 84.2% (95% CI: 58.8-93.9%) against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19. Effectiveness against infection was highest at 57.1% (95% CI: 55.9-58.3%) in the first month after the booster but waned thereafter and was modest at only 14.4% (95% CI: 7.3-20.9%) by the sixth month. In the seventh month and thereafter, coincident with BA.4/BA.5 and BA.2.75* subvariant incidence, effectiveness was progressively negative reaching -20.3% (95% CI: -55.0-29.0%) after one year of follow-up. Similar levels and patterns of protection were observed irrespective of prior infection status, clinical vulnerability, or type of vaccine (BNT162b2 versus mRNA-1273). Conclusions: Boosters reduced infection and severe COVID-19, particularly among those clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19. However, protection against infection waned after the booster, and eventually suggested an imprinting effect of compromised protection relative to the primary series. However, imprinting effects are unlikely to negate the overall public health value of booster vaccinations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.11.14.22282103     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.11.14.22282103&atitle=Long-term+COVID-19+booster+effectiveness+by+infection+history+and+clinical+vulnerability+and+immune+imprinting&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Chemaitelly&aufirst=Hiam&auinit=H.&aufull=Chemaitelly+H.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=H&auinitm=,adult;clinical trial;cohort analysis;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;female;follow up;human;incidence;male;nonhuman;original antigenic sin;public health;Qatar;retrospective study;revaccination;SARS-CoV-2 Omicron;vulnerability;elasomeran;messenger RNA;tozinameran,,

We assessed BNT162b2 real-world effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection among children and adolescents in Qatar. Methods: Three matched, retrospective, target-trial, cohort studies were conducted to compare incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the national cohort of vaccinated individuals to incidence in the national cohort of unvaccinated individuals. Associations were estimated using Cox proportional-hazards regression models. Results: Effectiveness of the 10 µg dose for children against Omicron infection was 25.7% (95% CI: 10.0-38.6%). It was highest at 49.6% (95% CI: 28.5-64.5%) right after the second dose, but waned rapidly thereafter and was negligible after 3 months. Effectiveness was 46.3% (95% CI: 21.5-63.3%) among those aged 5-7 years and 16.6% (-4.2-33.2%) among those aged 8-11 years. Effectiveness of the 30 µg dose for adolescents against Omicron infection was 30.6% (95% CI: 26.9-34.1%), but many adolescents were vaccinated months earlier. Effectiveness waned with time after the second dose. Effectiveness was 35.6% (95% CI: 31.2-39.6%) among those aged 12-14 years and 20.9% (13.8-27.4%) among those aged 15-17 years. Effectiveness of the 30 µg dose for adolescents against pre-Omicron infection was 87.6% (95% CI: 84.0-90.4%) and waned relatively slowly after the second dose. Conclusions: Pediatric vaccination is associated with modest and rapidly waning protection against Omicron infection. Adolescent vaccination is associated with stronger and more durable protection, perhaps because of the larger dose size. Age at such young age appears to play a role in determining vaccine protection, with greater protection observed in younger than older children or adolescents.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.07.26.22278045     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.07.26.22278045&atitle=Effectiveness+of+the+BNT162b2+vaccine+against+SARS-CoV-2+infection+among+children+and+adolescents+in+Qatar&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Chemaitelly&aufirst=Hiam&auinit=H.&aufull=Chemaitelly+H.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=H&auinitm=,adolescent;child;clinical article;clinical trial;cohort analysis;comparative effectiveness;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;female;human;immunity;incidence;male;preschool child;Qatar;retrospective study;school child;vaccination;tozinameran;Adolescent;Vaccination;Only Child;Child,,

We compared head-to-head protection conferred by natural infection to that from the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines in Qatar, between February 28, 2020 and March 6, 2022. METHODS: Two national matched retrospective target-trial cohort studies were conducted to compare incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization and death among those with a documented primary infection to incidence among those with a two-dose primary-series vaccination. Associations were estimated using Cox proportional-hazards regression models. RESULTS: The overall adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) for infection was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.45-0.48) comparing those with a prior infection to those vaccinated with BNT162b2, and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.48-0.53) comparing those with a prior infection to those vaccinated with mRNA-1273. For BNT162b2, the AHR decreased gradually from 0.55 (95% CI: 0.46-0.65) in the fourth month after primary infection/vaccination to 0.31 (95% CI: 0.27-0.37) in the eighth month, while for mRNA-1273, it decreased from 0.80 (95% CI: 0.59-1.07) to 0.35 (95% CI: 0.29-0.41) over the same time period. During the Omicron wave, the AHR was ~0.50 for BNT162b2 and ~0.60 for mRNA-1273. The overall AHR for any severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 (against all variants) was 0.32 (95% CI: 0.10-1.00) for BNT162b2, and 0.58 (95% CI: 0.14-2.43) for mRNA-1273. CONCLUSIONS: Natural infection was associated with stronger and more durable protection against infection, regardless of the variant, than mRNA primary-series vaccination.

Estimated protection from Omicron infection for two and three doses were 14.9% (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 12.3—19.7%) and 43.2% (42.2—47.4%) for those without known prior infections, 47.8% (95% CI, 46.6—52.8%) and 61.3% (95% CI, 60.7—64.8%) for those infected before the emergence of Delta, and 73.1% (95% CI, 69.8—80.1%) and 86.8% (95% CI, 82.1—92.7) for those infected during the period of Delta predominance. CONCLUSION A third mRNA dose provided significant, additional protection over two doses, including among individuals with prior infection. Our findings suggest that vaccination should remain a priority—even in settings with high levels of transmission and prior infection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1101/2022.05.26.22275639     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.05.26.22275639&atitle=Protection+against+Omicron+conferred+by+mRNA+primary+vaccine+series%2C+boosters%2C+and+prior+infection&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Chin&aufirst=Elizabeth+T.&auinit=E.T.&aufull=Chin+E.T.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=E&auinitm=T,"adult;California;controlled study;correctional facility;demography;human;nonhuman;resident;SARS-CoV-2 Omicron;vaccination;messenger RNA;vaccine;RNA, Messenger;Vaccination;Vaccines",,

Understanding SARSCoV-2 infection risk post-vaccination among PWH is essential for informing vaccination guidelines. Objective: Estimate the risk of breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated people with (PWH) and without (PWoH) HIV in the US. Design, setting, and participants: The Corona-Infectious-Virus Epidemiology Team (CIVET)-II cohort collaboration consists of 4 longitudinal cohorts from integrated health systems and academic health centers. Each cohort identified individuals ≥18 years old, in-care, and fully vaccinated for COVID-19 through 30 June 2021. PWH were matched to PWoH on date fully vaccinated, age group, race/ethnicity, and sex at birth. Incidence rates per 1,000 person-years and cumulative incidence of breakthrough infections with 95% confidence intervals ([,]) were estimated by HIV status. Cox proportional hazards models estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of breakthrough infections by HIV status adjusting for demographic factors, prior COVID-19 illness, vaccine type (BNT162b2, [Pfizer], mRNA-1273 [Moderna], Jansen Ad26.COV2.S [J&J]), calendar time, and cohort. Risk factors for breakthroughs among PWH, were also investigated. Exposure: HIV infection Outcome: COVID-19 breakthrough infections, defined as laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 diagnosis after an individual was fully vaccinated. Results: Among 109,599 individuals (31,840 PWH and 77,759 PWoH), the rate of breakthrough infections was higher in PWH versus PWoH: 44 [41, 48] vs. 31 [29, 33] per 1,000 person-years. Cumulative incidence at 210 days after date fully vaccinated was low, albeit higher in PWH versus PWoH overall (2.8% versus 2.1%, log-rank p<0.001, risk difference=0.7% [0.4%, 1.0%]) and within each vaccine type. Breakthrough infection risk was 41% higher in PWH versus PWoH (aHR=1.41 [1.28, 1.56]). Among PWH, younger age (18-24 versus 45-54), history of COVID-19 prior to fully vaccinated date, and J&J vaccination (versus Pfizer) were associated with increased risk of breakthroughs. There was no association of breakthrough with HIV viral load suppression or CD4 count among PWH. Conclusions and Relevance: COVID-19 vaccination is effective against infection with SARSCoV-2 strains circulating through 30 Sept 2021. PWH have an increased risk of breakthrough infections compared to PWoH. Recommendations for additional vaccine doses should be expanded to all PWH.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2021.12.02.21267182     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2021.12.02.21267182&atitle=COVID-19+infections+post-vaccination+by+HIV+status+in+the+United+States&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Coburn&aufirst=Sally+B.&auinit=S.B.&aufull=Coburn+S.B.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2021&auinit1=S&auinitm=B,adult;attributable risk;CD4 lymphocyte count;cohort analysis;controlled study;cumulative incidence;demography;ethnicity;female;groups by age;health center;human;Human immunodeficiency virus infection;infection risk;major clinical study;male;nonhuman;race;risk factor;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;United States;vaccination;virus load;ibacovavec;tozinameran;elasomeran;Vaccination,,

Moses, Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Hadassah-Hebrew University, Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel","During December 2021 the fifth COVID-19 wave started in Israel, caused mostly by the Omicron variant, affecting the unvaccinated and vaccinated population. Ninety percent of the Israeli adults, including most healthcare workers (HCWs), received three doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine until September 2021. Following the success and safety of the 3rd dose in preventing infection and severe disease, on December 30, 2021, the Israeli Ministry of Health recommended a voluntary 4th vaccine dose to adults above 60 years, immunocompromised, and HCWs. We compared breakthrough infections in HCWs, between 3 and 4-dose recipients. Hospitals collected data on personnel vaccinations and infections dates. The study cohort included all HCWs in eleven hospitals in Israel, who have been vaccinated with three doses up to September 30, 2021, and had not contracted COVID-19 before the vaccination campaign (January 2, 2022). We calculated breakthrough infection rates in 4-dose recipients (more than six days after vaccination) vs. 3-dose recipients. Rate-ratios were calculated for the entire cohort and for subgroups (hospital, sex, age-groups, and profession). Additionally, we repeated the calculations on 4-dose and 3-dose recipients who received the 3rd dose on the same date and were matched for sex, age group, profession and hospital. We generated time-dependent Cox-regression models to account for 4th dose administration timing (Supplement). There were 29,612 HCWs who received 3 vaccine doses between August and September 2021; of these, 5,331 (18.0%) received the 4th dose during January 2022 and were not infected by the first week after vaccination. Overall breakthrough infection rates in the 4-dose and 3-dose groups were 368/5331 (6.9%) and 4802/24280 (19.8%), respectively. The RR (95%CI) was 0.35 (0.32 to 0.39) for crude analysis, and 0.61 (0.54 to 0.71) in the matched analysis. The adjusted HR in the Cox-regression model was 0.56 (0.50 to 0.63). In both groups, severe disease and death were not reported. Our data shows that the 4th BNT162b2 dose resulted in reduced breakthrough infection rates among HCWs. This reduction, similar to the findings in the Israeli elderly population, is lower than that observed after the 3rd dose. Nevertheless, considering the high infectivity of the Omicron variant, which led to critical medical staff shortages, a 4th vaccine dose should be considered to mitigate the infection rate among HCWs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.04.11.22273327     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.04.11.22273327&atitle=Effectiveness+of+the+BNT162b+vaccine+fourth+dose+in+reducing+SARS-CoV-2+infection+among+healthcare+workers+in+Israel%2C+a+multi-center+cohort+study&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Cohen&aufirst=Matan+J.&auinit=M.J.&aufull=Cohen+M.J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=M&auinitm=J,aged;breakthrough infection;calculation;case report;clinical article;cohort analysis;coronavirus disease 2019;female;groups by age;health care personnel;human;infection rate;Israel;Israeli;male;medical staff;occupation;vaccination;bnt 162 vaccine;tozinameran;Cohort Studies;Vaccination,,

There is the need to quantify vaccine effectiveness in real-word contexts, including people at high risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), such as health care workers (HCWs). Objectives To evaluate vaccine effectiveness among hospital HCWs. Methods We performed a cohort study among HCWs of a large University hospital in Milan, Lombardy, Italy by merging routinely collected data on demographics, COVID-19 vaccination, and polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) tests performed on nasopharyngeal swabs. Follow-up started on December 27, 2020 (start of vaccination campaign). We included HCWs never PCR-positive before the start date and with at least a PCR test afterwards. Vaccination was treated as a time-dependent variable by calculating person-years (PY) at risk before and after vaccine doses. Subjects contributed PY until first positive PCR test (cases) or last test for never positive HCWs (to avoid immortal time bias). We calculated infection rates (cases per 1000 PY), rate ratios (RR, with a Poisson regression model adjusted for gender, age, occupation and 30-day periods), vaccine effectiveness (VE = (1-RR)x100) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) taking never vaccinated HCWs as reference. Results As of May 10, there were 3,152 vaccinated (97% with BNT162b2, 140 with one dose, 2,679 with two doses) and 333 non-vaccinated. We counted 29 infected cases (rate 385) among non-vaccinated, 6 (rate 65) from day 14 after the first dose (VE 79%, CI 49-92%), and 24 (rate 65) from day 7 after the second dose (VE 89%, CI 80-94%). Most cases after vaccination were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Conclusion In these preliminary analysis we found high effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine in HCWs in our hospital. Further work is needed to assess long-term effectiveness and to better plan future preventive strategies among this high-risk occupational group.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1136/OEM-2021-EPI.228     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14707926&id=doi:10.1136%2FOEM-2021-EPI.228&atitle=Effectiveness+of+COVID-19+vaccine+in+health+care+workers%2C+Milan%2C+Italy&stitle=Occup.+Environ.+Med.&title=Occupational+and+Environmental+Medicine&volume=78&issue=SUPPL+1&spage=A84&epage=A85&aulast=Consonni&aufirst=Dario&auinit=D.&aufull=Consonni+D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=A84-A85&date=2021&auinit1=D&auinitm=,tozinameran;adult;clinical trial;cohort analysis;comparative effectiveness;conference abstract;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;demography;dependent variable;drug therapy;female;follow up;gender;health care personnel;human;infection rate;Italy;major clinical study;male;nasopharyngeal swab;remission;risk assessment;university hospital;vaccination;Vaccination,,

Methods: A population-based study was performed using the data from the Clalit Health Services in Israel. We assembled a cohort of patients with diagnoses of psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis (collectively termed PsD) and matched them by age, sex, and clinic (1:5 ratio) with non-psoriatic controls. For assessment of vaccine effectiveness, the following 2 periods were analyzed separately: Period 1 which corresponds to initiation of COVID-19 vaccinations until initiation of booster vaccines (December 2020-August 2021); Period 2 corresponds to initiation of booster vaccines to end of study (August 2021-December 2021). Study outcomes included: SARS-CoV2 PCR positivity and hospitalization for COVID-19. For assessment of the association of medications and COVID-19-related outcomes, we performed a matched nested casecontrol study within the PsD cohort in which each case (SARS-CoV2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization) was matched with 10 controls (negative for these outcomes). Vaccine effectiveness was assessed using regression models with time varying covariates for vaccination status adjusted for demographics, comorbidities and medication use. Results: A total of 128,754 patients with PsD and 600,439 controls (5,934 vs. 26,292 positive SARS-CoV2; 315 vs. 1,127 hospitalized, respectively). Vaccine effectiveness for SARS-CoV2 infection was similar among patients with PsD and controls (HR for 2nd vaccine: 0.20 vs. 0.20, respectively; Figure 1A). Vaccine effectiveness for COVID-19 hospitalization was also similar among PsD patients and controls (HR for 2nd vaccine: 0.15 vs. 0.08, respectively; Figure 2A). Booster vaccines Figure 1.-Vaccine effectiveness for SARS-CoV2 infection in patients with PsD vs. controls (1A) and among patients with PsD alone (1B) remained effective in reducing risk of infections (HRs for of 3rdvaccine: 0.41) and hospitalization (HR for of 3rd vaccine < 0.01) among patients with PsD. When the analysis was restricted to patients with PsD and adjusted for use of systemic therapies, vaccines remained effective for SARS-CoV2 infections (OR period 1: 2nd vaccine: 0.19; OR period 2: 3rd vaccine: < 0.01; Figure 1B) and hospitalizations (OR period 1: 2nd vaccine: 0.01; OR period 2: 3rd vaccine: 0.17; Figure 2B). Use of etanercept was associated with higher risk of SARS-CoV2 infection and JAK inhibitors use was associated with higher risk of hospitalizations (Table 1). PsA status was not associated with higher risk of both outcomes compared to patients with psoriasis alone. Conclusion: The COVID-19 vaccine has similar effectiveness in patients with PsD to that seen in non-psoriatic controls. Risk of COVID-19 hospitalization among PsD patients may be influenced by certain immune modulating therapies.

Methods: A test-negative design was used with controls matched to cases (6:1) on epidemiological week of SARS-CoV-2 test date. mRNA vaccination was defined by receipt of the first dose ?21 days or second dose ?14 days before the test date. HCWs?18 years old tested for SARS-CoV-2 between epi-weeks 3 and 39 (January 17-October 2, 2021) were included, when varying dosing intervals and a mix of circulating variants of concern contributed, including Delta dominance provincially from epi-week 31 (August 1). Results: Single-and two-dose analyses included 1265 and 1246 cases, respectively. The median follow-up period (interquartile range) was 49 (34-69) days for single-dose and 89 (61-123) days for two-dose recipients, with 12%, 31%, and 58% of second doses given 3-5, 6, or?7 weeks after the first. Adjusted mRNA VE against SARS-CoV-2 was 71% (95% CI, 66%-76%) for one dose and 90% (95% CI, 88%-92%) for two doses, similar to two heterologous mRNA doses (92%; 95% CI, 86%-95%). Two-dose VE remained>80% at ?28 weeks post-second dose. Two-dose VE was consistently 5%-7% higher with a?7-week vs 3-5-week interval between doses, but with overlapping confidence intervals. Conclusions: Among HCWs, we report substantial single-dose and strong and sustained two-dose mRNA vaccine protection, with the latter maintained for at least 7 months. These findings support a longer interval between doses, with global health and equity implications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative | USER-NOTES: {""Sabir""=>[""test-negative matching""]}",10.1093/ofid/ofac178     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=23288957&id=doi:10.1093%2Fofid%2Fofac178&atitle=SARS-CoV-2+mRNA+Vaccine+Effectiveness+in+Health+Care+Workers+by+Dosing+Interval+and+Time+since+Vaccination%3A+Test-Negative+Design%2C+British+Columbia%2C+Canada&stitle=Open+Forum+Infect.+Dis.&title=Open+Forum+Infectious+Diseases&volume=9&issue=5&spage=&epage=&aulast=El+Adam&aufirst=Shiraz&auinit=S.&aufull=El+Adam+S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=S&auinitm=,"SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;adult;aged;article;Canada;data extraction;diagnostic procedure;drug dose;drug efficacy;female;health care personnel;hospital personnel;human;immunization;major clinical study;male;normal human;nurse;occupational therapist;paramedical personnel;pharmacist;pharmacy technician;physician;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;test negative design;vaccination;variant of concern;Vaccination;British Columbia;RNA, Messenger",,

Farah, Ministry of Public Health, Epidemiological Surveillance Program, Beirut, Lebanon","Introduction In Lebanon, the nationwide vaccination against COVID-19 was launched in February-2021 using Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and prioritizing elderly, persons with comorbidities and healthcare workers. Our study aims to estimate the post-introduction vaccine effectiveness (VE) of Pfizer-BioNTech in preventing COVID-19 hospitalization among ≥75 years in Lebanon. Methods A case-control study design was used. Cases were Lebanese, ≥75 years and hospitalized with positive PCR result during April-May 2021. Cases were randomly selected from the COVID-19 database of the Epidemiological Surveillance Unit(ESU) at the Ministry of Public Health(MOPH). Each case was matched by age and locality to 2 controls. Controls were hospitalized, non-COVID-19 patients with negative PCR result, randomly selected from the MOPH hospital admission database. VE was calculated for fully and partially vaccinated, using multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses. Results 345 cases and 814 controls were recruited. Half were females, with a mean age of 83 years. 14 cases(5%) and 143 controls(22%) were fully vaccinated. Bivariate analysis showed significant association with: gender, month of confirmation/admission, general health, chronic medical conditions, main income source and living arrangement. After adjusting for month of admission and gender, multivariate analysis yielded a VE of 82% (95%CI = 69%-90%) against COVID-19 associated hospitalization for those fully vaccinated and 53% (95%CI = 23%-71%) for those partially vaccinated (≥14 days of first or within 14 days of second dose). Conclusions Our study showed that Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is effective in reducing risk for COVID-19-associated hospitalization in Lebanese elderly(≥75 years). Additional studies are warranted to explore vaccine effectiveness in reducing hospitalization in younger age groups, as well as in reducing covid-19 infections.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: case-control",10.1101/2022.01.19.22269514     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.01.19.22269514&atitle=Effectiveness+of+Pfizer-BioNTech+Vaccine+Against+COVID-19+Associated+Hospitalizations+among+Lebanese+Adults+%E2%89%A575+years-+Lebanon%2C+April-May+2021&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Farah&aufirst=Zeina&auinit=Z.&aufull=Farah+Z.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=Z&auinitm=,adult;aged;bivariate analysis;case control study;chronic disease;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;epidemiological surveillance;female;gender;groups by age;hospital admission;hospitalization;human;Lebanese;Lebanon;major clinical study;male;prevention;public health;randomized controlled trial;very elderly;vaccine;Vaccination,,

Ferrari Dos Santos, Fundação Hospital Amaral Carvalho, Jaú, Brazil","Background: HSCT recipients are profoundly immunosuppressed and health care workers (HCW) of transplant units need to be tested periodically by SARS CoV-2 PCR to avoid patient transmission during hospitalization. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study with periodic serology and nasal wash (NW) sampling to estimate the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in health professionals from HSCT unit before (May 2020 to January 2021) and after COVID-19 vaccination (January to October 2021) and to evaluate the occurrence of hospital acquired COVID-19 in HSCT recipients. In addition to periodic sampling, from inclusion (dzero) onwards, HCWs were daily surveyed for the presence of symptoms. NW was taken if symptoms and/or exposure to a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19. If tested positive by PCR, they were away for 14 days and returned to work with at least 1 negative PCR test. Detection of SARSCoV-2 was performed by PCR (RealStarÒ SARSCoV-2, Altona Diagnostics/ Germany) and monthly serology by ELISA (Anti-SARSCoV-2 ELISA, Euroimmun/ Brazil). The incidence of SARSCoV-2/COVID-19 was estimated by cumulative incidence. Study participants received the 1st dose of COVID-19 vaccines (Sinovac/Butantan or Oxford/AstraZeneca/Covishield) between January and March 2021, and the 2nd dose between February and June 2021. Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) was identified by the formula VE = (r0-r1)/r0 (r0 = rate in unvaccinated individuals; r1 = rate in vaccinated). Results: Between May 13, 2020 and March 22, 2021, 109 HCWs were included. The median follow-up was 259 (79-309) days. Before vaccination, 29 cases of SARS CoV-2/COVID-19 were diagnosed at a median of 53 days, for a cumulative incidence of 30 %. Thirteen cases (11.9%) were detected at inclusion and 16 during follow-up. Of the 13 cases detected at inclusion, 8 (30.8%) were diagnosed by serology, showing previous infection. During follow-up, 7 individuals dropped out of the study and one was not vaccinated. Thus, 101 HCWs were included in the post-vaccine analysis. Eight PAS (8%) received chAdOx1 (Oxford/Astrazeneca/Covishield) and 93 (92%) Sinovac (Butantan). After vaccination, 76 of the 78 susceptible HCWs tested positive (97.4%), 1(1.3%) had an indeterminate result, and 1(1.3%) had a negative result after the 2nd dose. Within a median postvaccine follow-up of 153 (91-165) days, 9 HCWs acquired COVID-19 (6 between the first and second dose) for a cumulative incidence of 9.7%. Three (33.35) acquired COVID-19 despite the presence of specific SARS CoV-2 antibodies. Considering only the susceptible subjects at vaccination (n=78), the rate of COVID-19 in unvaccinated (n=29) or partially vaccinated (n=6) was 44.8% (35 of 78) and the rate in those fully vaccinated was 3.8% (3 of 78), for a VE of 91.5%. Due to this intense surveillance of COVID-19 in the HSCT unit, no hospital-acquired COVID-19 was observed in HSCT recipients during the study period. Conclusions: In conclusion, a good serological response was observed after vaccination (97,4%), resulting in a decrease in the incidence of COVID-19 from 30% to 9,7%. The current pandemic scenario continues to represent a great challenge in HSCT units. COVID-19 control policies in HSCT health professionals successfully avoided hospital transmission of SARS CoV-2 to HSCT recipients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1038/s41409-022-01798-0     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14765365&id=doi:10.1038%2Fs41409-022-01798-0&atitle=SARS+CoV-2+infection+and+covid-19+in+health+care+workers+from+a+hematopoietic+stem+cell+transplant+%28HSCT%29+unit+before+and+after+vaccination%3A+A+prospective+cohort+study&stitle=Bone+Marrow+Transplant.&title=Bone+Marrow+Transplantation&volume=57&issue=&spage=289&epage=&aulast=Ferrari+Dos+Santos&aufirst=A.C.&auinit=A.C.&aufull=Ferrari+Dos+Santos+A.C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=289-&date=2022&auinit1=A&auinitm=C,SARS-CoV-2 antibody;vaxzevria;adult;Brazil;cohort analysis;conference abstract;coronavirus disease 2019;cumulative incidence;drug therapy;enzyme linked immunosorbent assay;female;follow up;Germany;graft recipient;health care personnel;hematopoietic stem cell;human;human cell;incidence;major clinical study;male;nonhuman;null result;pandemic;prospective study;serology;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;surgery;vaccination;Stem Cell Transplantation;Hematopoietic Stem Cells,,

Fillmore,"Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is particularly serious in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), with estimated mortality of over 30% in several studies. In the general population, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has been demonstrated to be an effective approach to preventing infection. However, patients with MM were not included in vaccination trials. Recent studies suggest that patients with compromised immune systems exhibit reduced antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and MM patients are often immunocompromised both due to MM itself and due to MM treatment. Thus, the objective of this retrospective cohort study in the national Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system was to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to prevent COVID-19 infection in MM patients during the 140-day period following initial vaccine availability. Methods This is a multicenter study of SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinated and unvaccinated patients at VA hospitals nationwide during the period from 12/15/2020 to 5/4/2021. We identified a cohort of MM patients who were alive and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection on their date of vaccination or inclusion as a control. For added comparison with a less immunocompromised population, we also identified a cohort of cancer survivors, defined as patients with any solid or hematologic malignancy who had been treated with systemic cancerdirected therapy subsequent to 8/15/2010, but had not been treated with such therapy in the 6 months prior to vaccination or inclusion as a control, and were alive and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection on that date. Vaccinated patients were exactly matched 1:1 to unvaccinated controls on race, VA facility, rurality of home address, cancer type, and treatment timing and modality with minimum distance matching on age. The primary exposure was receipt of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination effectiveness was defined as 1 minus the risk ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection for vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated controls. Results 6,891 MM patients met eligibility criteria and 4,367 were vaccinated during the study period. Of those, 1,606 vaccinated MM patients were matched 1:1 to 1,606 unvaccinated or not yet vaccinated controls. In addition, for comparison, 2,476 vaccinated cancer survivors were matched 1:1 to 2,476 unvaccinated or not yet vaccinated controls. Median follow-up was 44 days among MM patients and 46 days among cancer survivors. Vaccine effectiveness in the matched cohort of MM patients was 22.2% (95% CI, -133 to 82.7%) starting 14 days after the second dose. In contrast, effectiveness was 82.3% (95% CI 16.4 to 100%) starting 14 days after the second dose in the matched cohort of cancer survivors. Among vaccinated MM patients in the matched cohort, 14 (8.7 per 1000 patients) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 subsequent to vaccination. Among vaccinated cancer survivors in the matched cohort, 10 (4.0 per 1000 patients) were infected subsequent to vaccination. Conclusion Vaccination is an effective strategy for preventing SARS-CoV-2. However, effectiveness may be reduced in patients with MM, likely due to a co-existing immunosuppression both due to the disease process as well as associated therapy. Future studies are needed to evaluate the relationship between MM disease states, types of therapy used and treatment timing that may impact vaccine effectiveness, and to also determine if MM patients would benefit from post-vaccination serologies or a booster vaccination.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1182/blood-2021-154323     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15280020&id=doi:10.1182%2Fblood-2021-154323&atitle=Inadequate+sars-cov-2+vaccine+effectiveness+in+patients+with+multiple+myeloma%3A+A+large+nationwide+veterans+affairs+study&stitle=Blood&title=Blood&volume=138&issue=SUPPL+1&spage=400&epage=&aulast=Fillmore&aufirst=Nathanael+R.&auinit=N.R.&aufull=Fillmore+N.R.&coden=&isbn=&pages=400-&date=2021&auinit1=N&auinitm=R,SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;adult;antibody response;cancer patient;cancer survival;cancer survivor;clinical trial;cohort analysis;comparative effectiveness;conference abstract;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;eligibility criteria;female;follow up;health care system;hematologic malignancy;human;immune system;immunosuppressive treatment;major clinical study;male;multicenter study;multiple myeloma;nonhuman;outcome assessment;prevention;race;retrospective study;revaccination;serology;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;vaccinee;veteran;Multiple Myeloma;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

Fisman, 155 College Street, Toronto, ON, Canada","Background: Provision of safe and effective vaccines has been a remarkable public health achievement during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The effectiveness and durability of protection of the first two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is an important area for study, as are questions related to optimal dose combinations and dosing intervals. Methods: We performed a case-cohort study to generate real-world evidence on efficacy of first and second dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, using a population-based case line list and vaccination database for the province of Ontario, Canada between December 2020 and October 2021. Risk of infection after vaccination was evaluated in all laboratory-confirmed vaccinated SARS-CoV-2 cases, and a 2% sample of vaccinated controls, evaluated using survival analytic methods, including construction of Cox proportional hazards models. Vaccination status was treated as a time-varying covariate. Results: First and second doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine markedly reduced risk of infection (first dose efficacy 68%, 95% CI 67% to 69%; second dose efficacy 88%, 95% CI 87 to 88%). In multivariable models, extended dosing intervals were associated with lowest risk of breakthrough infection (HR for redosing 0.64 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.67) at 6-8 weeks). Heterologous vaccine schedules that mixed viral vector vaccine first doses with mRNA second doses were significantly more effective than mRNA only vaccines. Risk of infection largely vanished during the time period 4-6 months after the second vaccine dose, but rose markedly thereafter. Interpretation: A case-cohort design provided an efficient means to identify strong protective effects associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, particularly after the second dose of vaccine. However, this effect appeared to wane once more than 6 months had elapsed since vaccination. Heterologous vaccination and extended dosing intervals improved the durability of immune response.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: case-control",10.1101/2022.01.04.22268773     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.01.04.22268773&atitle=Timing+of+Breakthrough+Infection+Risk+After+Vaccination+Against+SARS-CoV-2&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Fisman&aufirst=David+N.&auinit=D.N.&aufull=Fisman+D.N.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=D&auinitm=N,analytic method;breakthrough infection;Canada;cohort analysis;controlled study;human;immune response;infection risk;nonhuman;Ontario;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;messenger RNA;SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;vector vaccine;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) populations are vulnerable group with high mortality when contracted COVID-19. We aimed to determine the effects of vaccine on the severity and mortality rate of COVID-19 infection among ESKD population in Malaysia. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study on the COVID19 infection among ESKD patients on maintenance dialysis, who were admitted for COVID-19 from 1stMay 2021 till 15thSeptember 2021 at Sultanah Aminah Hospital and Sultanah Nora Ismail Hospital in Johor, confirmed by either a positive RTK-Ag or RT-PCR SARS-CoV2 tests. Demographic, clinical, and vaccination data were collected. Subjects who had breakthrough COVID-19 at least 14 days after second dose of SARS-CoV2 vaccines were defined as “Vaccine” group (VG), while “no vaccine” group (NVG) included “Incompletely Vaccinated” (those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 within 14 days of second vaccine dose or received only first dose) or “Unvaccinated” when diagnosed with COVID-19. Severity of COVID-19 was classified into 5 categories as per Malaysian COVID-19 clinical practice guideline. The severity of infection were further dichotomised as mild-moderate (category 1-3) and severe (category 4-5) for analysis. We compared the demographic and clinical outcomes of VG vs NVG. Results: A total of 303 patients were recruited. Mean age was 57.3 (44.2-70.4) years old, while 53.8% had diabetes mellitus (DM) and 9.6% had cardiovascular disease (CVD). 148 (48.8%) and 155 (51.2%) belongs to VG and NVG respectively. There were no differences in the mean age, gender, prevalence of DM, modality of renal replacement therapy and diagnosis of primary disease between the two groups, but there was higher prevalence of CVD in the NVG vs VG (12.9% vs 6.1%, p = 0.044). Overall, 145 (47.9%) had mild-moderate infection, while 158 (52.1%) had severe infection. Mean CT value was 23.96 +/- 6.90. 78 (25.7%) subjects from overall cohort died from the infection. VG had similar CT value compared to NVG (23.99 vs 23.93, p = 0.953). However, the VG had lower incidence of severe infection (33.8% vs 69.7%, p < 0.001) and lower mortality rate (12.2% vs 38.7%, p < 0.001) compared to NVG. Increasing age, DM, CVD and lower CT values were predictors of death. The unadjusted mortality odds ratio (OR) of “Incompletely Vaccinated” group” and “Unvaccinated” group” were 0.965 (p = 0.924) and 0.217 (p < 0.001) respectively.

This study aims to estimate the COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic infection among HCW from Portuguese hospitals. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, we analysed data from HCW (all professional categories) from two central hospitals in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley and Centre regions of mainland Portugal between December 2020 and November 2021. VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated as one minus the confounder adjusted hazard ratios by Cox models considering age group, sex, presence of chronic disease and occupational exposure to patients diagnosed with COVID-19 as adjustment variables. Results: During the 11 months of follow up, the 2213 HCW contributed a total of 1950 person-years at risk and 171 SARS-CoV-2 events occurred. The COVID-19 incidence rate for unvaccinated HCW was 348.7 per 1000 person-years while for fully vaccinated HCW was 43.0 per 1000 person-years. We observed a VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection of 73.9% (95% CI: 26.2–90.8%) for complete vaccination status. Conclusion: This cohort study found a high COVID-19 VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in Portuguese HCW, which is in concordance with previous studies from other countries.

Gazit, 27 HaMared street, Tel Aviv, Israel","Objectives: The rapid spread of the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) alongside evidence of a relatively rapid waning of the third dose prompted Israel to administer a fourth dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine on January 2022. Thus far, sufficient real-world evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of a fourth dose against infection and severe COVID-19 are lacking. This study examined the short-term effectiveness of a fourth dose compared to three doses over the span of 10 weeks. Design: A retrospective test-negative case-control study, performing both a matched analysis and an unmatched multiple-tests analysis. Setting: Nationally centralized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), an Israeli national health fund that covers 2.5 million people. Participants: The study population included 97,499 MHS members aged 60 or older who were eligible to receive a fourth vaccine dose and performed at least one PCR test during the study period. Of them, 27,876 received the fourth dose and 69,623 received only three doses. Main outcomes and measures: Analyses focused on the period from January 10, 2022 (7 days after the fourth dose was first administered to eligible individuals) to March 13, 2022, an Omicron-dominant period in Israel. We evaluated two SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes: (1) breakthrough infection, defined as a positive PCR test performed 7 or more days after inoculation with the BNT162b2 vaccine; and (2) breakthrough infection resulting in a severe disease, defined as COVID-19-related hospitalization or COVID-19 associated mortality. Results: A fourth dose provided considerable additional protection against both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease relative to three doses of the vaccine. However, vaccine effectiveness against infection varied over time, peaking during the third week with a VE of 64% (95% CI: 62.0%-65.9%) and declining to 29.2% (95% CI: 17.7%-39.1%) by the end of the 10-week follow-up period. Unlike VE against infection, the relative effectiveness of a fourth dose against severe COVID-19 was maintained at high level (>73%) throughout the 9-week follow-up period. Importantly, severe disease was a relatively rare event, occurring in <1% of both fourth dose and third dose only recipients. Conclusions: A fourth dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine provided considerable additional protection against both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease relative to three doses of the vaccine. However, effectiveness of the fourth dose against infection wanes sooner than that of the third dose.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1101/2022.03.24.22272835     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.03.24.22272835&atitle=Relative+Effectiveness+of+Four+Doses+Compared+to+Three+Dose+of+the+BNT162b2+Vaccine+in+Israel&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Gazit&aufirst=Sivan&auinit=S.&aufull=Gazit+S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=S&auinitm=,adult;breakthrough infection;case control study;comparative effectiveness;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;female;follow up;hospitalization;human;inoculation;Israel;male;mortality;nonhuman;outcome assessment;public health;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;tozinameran;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

Geiger, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, United States","Background: Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is recommended for all persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) to prevent severe COVID infections and death. However, it is unknown how many pwMS are fully vaccinated or have received a booster dose and whether vaccination patterns differ across patient subgroups. In addition, there is limited research evaluating COVID outcomes by vaccination status among pwMS despite concerns that pwMS receiving immunosuppressive therapies might have an impaired immune response that could impact vaccine effectiveness. Objective: To describe COVID vaccination patterns and COVID outcomes among pwMS in the FlywheelMS cohort and in subgroups of pwMS, including by disease-modifying therapy (DMT) status. Methods: All pwMS included in the FlywheelMS cohort, a patient-centred study that digitises all health records for US-based pwMS across all US sites of care, were asked to complete a questionnaire on their COVID vaccination history (completed 2 July-4 May 2022). COVID diagnoses and outcomes were identified in health records. Vaccination rates were calculated for all pwMS overall and in subgroups, including by index DMT (i.e. the most recent DMT in the 6 months prior to vaccination). Breakthrough infections >14 days after the last dose of the primary vaccine series and COVID-related outcomes (i.e. hospitalisation, severe hospitalisation, death) were evaluated overall and in subgroups of pwMS, including by DMT status. Results: A total of 1041 pwMS (20% response rate) completed the survey and were included in the study: 182 (17%) were unvaccinated, 11 (1%) were partially vaccinated and 848 (81%) were fully vaccinated. Among the fully vaccinated, 595 (70%) received 1 and 47 (6%) received ≥2 booster/additional doses. Fully vaccinated pwMS were more likely to be older (mean age, 50 vs 49 years), male (22% vs 13%) and treated with any DMT (76% vs 63%) compared with unvaccinated pwMS. Among all fully vaccinated pwMS, 48 (6%) had a documented breakthrough infection after vaccination. Vaccination rates and outcomes following breakthrough infections (i.e. hospitalisation, severe hospitalisation, death) for subgroups will be presented in the full poster. Conclusions: Rates of full vaccination and boosters were higher among pwMS compared with all adults in the US. The documented breakthrough rate among fully vaccinated pwMS was low and similar to that in the general population, suggesting vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 provides benefits among pwMS.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1177/13524585221123682     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F13524585221123682&atitle=COVID-19+vaccination+patterns+and+outcomes+among+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis+in+the+FlywheelMS+cohort&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=28&issue=3&spage=872&epage=&aulast=Geiger&aufirst=C.&auinit=C.&aufull=Geiger+C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=872-&date=2022&auinit1=C&auinitm=,vaccine;adult;breakthrough infection;cohort analysis;conference abstract;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;hospitalization;human;major clinical study;male;multiple sclerosis;nonhuman;outcome assessment;questionnaire;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;vaccinee;Vaccination;Multiple Sclerosis;Vaccines,,

Glasziou, Institute for Evidence-Based Healthcare, Faculty HS&M, Bond University, Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","BACKGROUND: Recent observational studies suggest that vaccines may have little effect in preventing infection with the Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. However, the observed effects may be confounded by patient factors, preventive behaviours, or differences in testing behaviour. To assess potential confounding, we examined differences in testing behaviour between unvaccinated and vaccinated populations. METHODS: We recruited 1,526 Australian adults for an online ran-domized study about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing in late 2021, collecting self-reported vaccination status and three measures of COVID-19 testing behaviour: testing in past month or ever and test intention if they woke with a sore throat. We examined the association between testing intentions and vaccination status in the trial’s baseline data. RESULTS: Of the 1,526 participants (mean age 31 y), 22% had a COVID-19 test in the past month and 61% ever; 17% were unvaccinated, 11% were partially vaccinated (one dose), and 71% were fully vaccinated (two or more doses). Fully vaccinated participants were twice as likely as those who were unvaccinated (relative risk [RR] 2.2, 95% CI 1.8 to 2.8, p < 0.001) to report positive COVID testing intentions. Partially vaccinated participants had less positive intentions than fully vaccinated participants (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.89, p < 0.001) but higher intentions than unvaccinated participants (RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.4 to 1.6, p = 0.002). DISCUSSION: Vaccination predicted greater COVID-19 testing intentions and would substantially bias observed vaccine effectiveness. To account for differential testing behaviours, test-negative designs are currently the preferred option, but their assumptions need more thorough examination.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort | USER-NOTES: {""Sabir""=>[""discusses testing behavior""]}",10.3138/jammi-2022-0002     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=23710888&id=doi:10.3138%2Fjammi-2022-0002&atitle=Testing+behaviour+may+bias+observational+studies+of+vaccine+effectiveness&stitle=JAMMI&title=JAMMI&volume=7&issue=3&spage=242&epage=246&aulast=Glasziou&aufirst=Paul&auinit=P.&aufull=Glasziou+P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=242-246&date=2022&auinit1=P&auinitm=,influenza vaccine;SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;adult;article;Australian;behavior;coronavirus disease 2019;COVID-19 testing;disease severity;drug efficacy;false negative result;female;health care personnel;hospitalization;human;immunization;influenza vaccination;male;observational study;pandemic;risk factor;SARS coronavirus;SARS-CoV-2 Omicron;self report;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;sore throat;vaccination;vaccine effectiveness;World Health Organization;Observer Variation;Vaccination;Bias (Epidemiology);Vaccines,,

Data were gathered between 17 February and 15 December 2021. Duration of each period in this study was 89 days for Beta, 180 days or Delta and 30 days for Omicron. Results: A total of 40 538 BTIs were observed, with 609 during Beta, 22 279 during Delta and 17 650 during Omicron. By 15 December, daily infections during Omicron were three times that seen during the peak observed during Delta. However, unlike the Delta period, with Omicron there was a clear and early de-coupling of hospitalisation from cases as a percentage of the Delta peak curves. Omicron significantly infected a greater proportion of HCW in the 18-30 year age-group, compared with the 55+ age group. There were 1 914 BTI-related hospitalisations - 77, 1 429 and 408 in the Beta (89 days), Delta (180 days) and Omicron (30 days) periods, respectively. During Omicron, 91% hospitalized HCWs required general ward care, 6% high care and 3% intensive care, compared with 89% general ward care, 4% high care and 7% intensive care, during Delta and 78% general care, 7% high care and 16% intensive care during Beta (p<0.001). During Beta and Beta 43% of hospitalized HCW needed supplementary oxygen and 7-8% needed ventilation, compared with 16% and 0.2% respectively during the Omicron period (p<0.001). Median length of hospitalization was significantly lower with Omicron compared with Beta and Delta (3 days compared with 5-6 days, p<0.001). Conclusions: We illustrate more BTIs but reassuringly less severe Covid-19 with Omicron. Reinfections and Omicron-driven primary infections were likely driven by high population SARSCoV-2 seroprevalence, waning vaccine effectiveness over time, increased Omicron infectivity, Omicron immune evasion or a combination of these and need further investigation. Follow-up of this cohort will continue and reports will be updated, as time and infections accrue.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2021.12.21.21268171     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2021.12.21.21268171&atitle=Breakthrough+Covid-19+infections+during+periods+of+circulating+Beta%2C+Delta+and+Omicron+variants+of+concern%2C+among+health+care+workers+in+the+Sisonke+Ad26.COV2.S+vaccine+trial%2C+South+Africa&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Goga&aufirst=Ameena&auinit=A.&aufull=Goga+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2021&auinit1=A&auinitm=,adult;artificial ventilation;clinical trial;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;follow up;groups by age;health care personnel;hospitalization;human;immune evasion;nonhuman;phase 3 clinical trial;primary infection;reinfection;seroprevalence;South Africa;variant of concern;ibacovavec;oxygen,,

Design: Retrospective, test-negative, case-control study, with matched analysis. Setting: Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, between 12/1/21-4/1/21. Participants: 422,144 individuals ≥50 years who had received two or three doses of COVID-19 vaccines and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Main outcome measures: Odds ratios of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisations and death after administering different boosters, compared to a two-dose primary scheme. Results: Of 221,933(52.5%) individuals with a positive test, 190,884(45.2%) had received a two-dose vaccination scheme and 231,260(54.8%) a three-dose scheme. The matched analysis included 127,014 cases and 180,714 controls. The three-dose scheme reduced infections (OR 0.81[0.80-0.83]) but after 60 days protection dropped (OR 1.04[1.01-1.06]). The booster dose decreased the risk of hospitalisations and deaths after 15-59 days (ORs 0.28[0.25-0.32] and 0.25[0.22-0.28] respectively), which persisted after administration for 75[66-89] days. Administration of a homologous booster after a primary scheme with vectored-vaccines provided low protection against infections (OR 0.94[0.92-0.97] and 1.05[1.01-1.09] before and after 60 days). Protection against hospitalisations and death was significant (OR 0.30[0.26-0.35] and 0.29[0.25-0.33] respectively) but decreased after 60 days (OR 0.59[0.47-0.74] and 0.51[0.41- 0.64] respectively). The inoculation of a heterologous booster after a primary course with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, rAd26-rAd5, BBIBP-CorV, or heterologous schemes, offered some protection against infection (OR 0.70[0.68-0.71]), which decreased after 60 days (OR 1.01[0.98-1.04]).

This study aimed to estimate the effectiveness in two age groups (12-59 and 60 years or above) of two and three vaccine doses (BNT162b2 mRNA or mRNA-1273 vaccine) by time since vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization in an Alpha, Delta and Omicron dominated period. Methods A Danish nationwide cohort study design was used to estimate VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization with the Alpha, Delta and Omicron variants. Information was obtained from nationwide registries and linked using a unique personal identification number. The study included all residents in Denmark aged 12 years or above (18 years or above for the analysis of three doses) in the Alpha (February 20 to June 15, 2021), Delta (July 4 to November 20, 2021) and Omicron (December 21, 2021 to January 31, 2022) dominated periods. VE estimates including 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazard regression models with adjustments for age, sex and geographical region. Vaccination status was included as a time-varying exposure. Findings In the oldest age group, VE against infection after two doses was 91.0% (95% CI: 88.5; 92.9) for the Alpha variant, 82.2% (95% CI: 75.3; 87.1) for the Delta variant and 39.9% (95% CI: 26.4; 50.9) for the Omicron variant 14-30 days since vaccination. The VE waned over time and was 71.5% (95% CI: 54.7; 82.8), 49.8% (95% CI: 46.5; 52.8) and 4.7% (95% CI: 0.2; 8.9) >120 days since vaccination against the three variants, respectively. Higher estimates were observed after the third dose with VE estimates against infection of 86.0% (Delta, 95% CI: 83.3; 88.3) and 57.6% (Omicron, 95% CI: 55.8; 59.4) 14-30 days since vaccination. Among both age groups, VE against COVID-19-related hospitalization 14-30 days since vaccination with two or three doses was 94.8% or above for the Alpha and Delta variants, whereas among the youngest age group, VE estimates against the Omicron variant after two and three doses were 62.4% (95% CI: 46.3; 73.6) and 89.8% (95% CI: 87.9; 91.3), respectively. Conclusions Two vaccine doses provided high protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization with the Alpha and Delta variants with protection waning over time. Two vaccine doses provided only limited protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization with the Omicron variant. The third vaccine dose substantially increased the protection against Delta and Omicron.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.04.20.22274061     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.04.20.22274061&atitle=Vaccine+effectiveness+against+SARS-CoV-2+infection+and+COVID-19-related+hospitalization+with+the+Alpha%2C+Delta+and+Omicron+SARS-CoV-2+variants%3A+a+nationwide+Danish+cohort+study&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Gram&aufirst=Mie+Agermose&auinit=M.A.&aufull=Gram+M.A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=M&auinitm=A,child;cohort analysis;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;Danish citizen;Denmark;drug therapy;female;groups by age;hospitalization;human;male;multicenter study;nonhuman;regression model;resident;SARS-CoV-2 Delta;SARS-CoV-2 Omicron;school child;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;elasomeran;messenger RNA;tozinameran;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

Methods: HCWs were vaccinated over 3 months (17 February-17 May 2021). Safety was monitored by self-reporting, facility reporting and linkage to national databases. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against Covid-19 related hospitalisation, hospitalisation requiring critical or intensive care and death, ascertained 28 days or more post vaccination was assessed up until 17 July 2021. Nested sub-cohorts (A and B) from two national medical schemes were evaluated to assess VE using a matched retrospective cohort design. Results: Over the 3-month period, 477234 HCWs were vaccinated in 122 vaccination sites across South Africa. VE derived from the sub-cohorts comprising 215 813 HCWs was 83% (95% CI 75-89) to prevent Covid-19 deaths, 75% (95% CI 69-82) to prevent hospital admissions requiring critical or intensive care and 67% (95% CI 62-71) to prevent Covid-19 related hospitalisations. The VE was maintained in older HCWs and those with comorbidities including HIV infection. VE remained consistent throughout the Beta and Delta dominant phases of the study. 10279 adverse events were reported and 139 (1.4%) were serious, including two cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome and four cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome who recovered. Conclusion: The single dose Ad26.COV2.S was safe and effective against severe Covid-19 disease and death post-vaccination, and against both Beta and Delta variants providing real-world evidence for its use globally.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",,ibacovavec;case report;clinical article;cohort analysis;comorbidity;comparative effectiveness;conference abstract;coronavirus disease 2019;drug safety;drug therapy;epidemic;health care personnel;hospital admission;hospitalization;human;Human immunodeficiency virus infection;intensive care;nonhuman;phase 3 clinical trial;prevention;retrospective study;SARS-CoV-2 Delta;side effect;South Africa;thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura;vaccination;variant of concern;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

With the continued increase in numbers of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, describing the characters of individuals who have experienced a COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough could be hugely important in helping to determine who may be at greatest risk. Method With the approval of NHS England we conducted a retrospective cohort study using routine clinical data from the OpenSAFELY TPP database of fully vaccinated individuals, linked to secondary care and death registry data, and described the characteristics of those experiencing a COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough. Results As of 01st November 2021, a total of 15,436,455 individuals were identified as being fully vaccinated against COVID-19, with a median follow-up time of 149 days (IQR: 107-179). From within this population, a total of 577245 (<4%) individuals reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. For every 1000 years of patient follow-up time, the corresponding incidence rate was 98.02 (95% CI 97.9-98.15). There were 16,120 COVID-19-related hospital admissions, 1,100 COVID-19 critical care admission patients and 3,925 COVID-19-related deaths; corresponding incidence rates of 2.72 (95% C 2.7-2.74), 0.19 (95% C 0.18-0.19) and 0.66 (95% C 0.65-0.67), respectively. When broken down by the initial priority group, higher rates of hospitalisation and death were seen in those in care homes and those over 80 years of age. Comorbidities with the highest rates of breakthrough COVID-19 included chronic kidney disease, dialysis, transplant, haematological malignancy, and immunocompromised. Conclusion The majority of COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough cases in England were mild with relatively few fully vaccinated individuals being hospitalised or dying as a result. However, some concerning differences in rates of breakthrough cases were identified in several clinical and demographic groups. While it is important to note that these findings are simply descriptive and cannot be used to answer why certain groups have higher rates of COVID-19 breakthrough than others, the emergence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 coupled with the continued increase in numbers of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests are concerning. As numbers of fully vaccinated individuals increases and follow-up time lengthens, so too will the number of COVID-19 breakthrough cases. Additional analyses, aimed at identifying individuals at higher risk, are therefore required.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2021.11.08.21265380     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2021.11.08.21265380&atitle=Describing+the+population+experiencing+COVID-19+vaccine+breakthrough+following+second+vaccination+in+England%3A+A+cohort+study+from+OpenSAFELY&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Green&aufirst=Amelia&auinit=A.&aufull=Green+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2021&auinit1=A&auinitm=,adult;cohort analysis;comorbidity;controlled study;COVID-19 testing;death registry;demography;drug therapy;England;female;follow up;hematologic malignancy;hospital admission;hospitalization;human;incidence;major clinical study;male;renal replacement therapy;retrospective study;secondary health care;surgery;transplantation;vaccination;SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;Cohort Studies;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

Seven months have passed since fourth doses were implemented, allowing for the examination of fourth dose protection over time. Methods: We used a test-negative design and linked databases to estimate the marginal effectiveness (4 versus 3 doses) and vaccine effectiveness (VE; 2, 3, or 4 doses versus no doses) of mRNA vaccines among Ontario LTC residents aged ≥60 years who were tested for SARSCoV-2 between December 30, 2021 and August 3, 2022. Outcome measures included any Omicron infection, symptomatic infection, and severe outcomes (hospitalization or death). Results: We included 21,275 Omicron cases and 273,466 test-negative controls. The marginal effectiveness of a fourth dose <84 days ago compared to a third dose received ≥84 days ago was 23% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 17-29%), 36% (95%CI 26-44%), and 37% (95%CI 24-48%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic infection, and severe outcomes, respectively. Additional protection provided by a fourth dose compared to a third dose was negligible against all outcomes ≥168 days after vaccination. Compared to unvaccinated individuals, vaccine effectiveness (VE) of a fourth dose decreased from 49% (95%CI 44%-54%) to 18% (95%CI 5-28%) against infection, 69% (95%CI 62-75%) to 44% (95%CI 24-59%) against symptomatic infection, and 82% (95%CI 77-86%) to 74% (95%CI 62-82%) against severe outcomes <84 days versus ≥168 days after vaccination. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that fourth doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines provide additional protection against Omicron-related outcomes in LTC residents, but the protection wanes over time, with more waning seen against infection than severe outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1101/2022.09.29.22280526     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.09.29.22280526&atitle=Effectiveness+and+Duration+of+Protection+of+a+Fourth+Dose+of+COVID-19+mRNA+Vaccine+among+Long-Term+Care+Residents+in+Ontario%2C+Canada&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Grewal&aufirst=Ramandip&auinit=R.&aufull=Grewal+R.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=R&auinitm=,"adult;Canada;comparative effectiveness;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;hospitalization;human;long term care;Ontario;outcome assessment;resident;vaccination;RNA vaccine;SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;RNA, Messenger;Vaccination;Long-Term Care;Vaccines",,

Grupel, Soroka University Medical Center, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, HaDarom, Israel","Background. It is unknown whether administering the second BNT162B2 vaccine dose on the cross-arm or the same arm as the first dose creates a more robust local and systemic immune response leading to favorable clinical results. We used data from Israel's largest healthcare provider (Clalit health services [CHS]) to assess the impact on vaccine effectiveness of contralateral vs. ipsilateral administration of BNT162b2. Methods. A retrospective cohort study, conducted on all CHS members who received the BNT162b2 vaccine between December 2020 and December 2021. The primary endpoint was a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 between 10 days and 38 days after the administration of the second dose of bnt162b2. A logistic regression model was used to compare the likelihood of COVID-19 infection at different time intervals following vaccination. Results. During the study, 2,678,226 CHS members received both doses of BNT162b and were eligible for analysis. Of these, 2,367,694 (88.41%) received the first two doses of the vaccine on the same arm (ipsilateral). The primary endpoint was observed in 2061 (0.077%) participants. The primary endpoint was observed more frequently in the contralateral vs. the ipsilateral group. The adjusted odds ratio for occurrence of the primary endpoint in the ipsilateral vs. the contralateral group was 0.83 (95% CI 0.73-0.94 P=0.004). Statistically significant reduction in OR was also observed in two of our secondary outcomes - hospitalization due to COVID-19 and all-cause mortality. Conclusion. Our study suggests that administration of the first and second BNT162b doses in the same arm, might increase vaccine effectiveness in the short term, possibly due to more robust local lymph node activation. This intervention could have a dramatic effect on public health. Further studies are needed to assess the long-term effectiveness of our findings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1093/ofid/ofac492.1583     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=23288957&id=doi:10.1093%2Fofid%2Fofac492.1583&atitle=Increased+short-term+vaccine+effectiveness+of+BNT162b2+with+same-arm+vs.+cross-arm+administration+of+sequential+doses&stitle=Open+Forum+Infect.+Dis.&title=Open+Forum+Infectious+Diseases&volume=9&issue=&spage=S776&epage=&aulast=Grupel&aufirst=Daniel&auinit=D.&aufull=Grupel+D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S776-&date=2022&auinit1=D&auinitm=,bnt 162 vaccine;tozinameran;adult;all cause mortality;cohort analysis;comparative effectiveness;conference abstract;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;COVID-19 testing;female;health care personnel;hospitalization;human;Israel;lymph node;male;outcome assessment;public health;retrospective study;vaccination;Vaccination,,

Hopkins, UK Health Security Agency, United Kingdom","Background: Understanding the duration and effectiveness of infection and vaccine-acquired SARS-CoV-2 immunity is essential to inform pandemic policy interventions, including the timing of vaccine-boosters. We investigated this in our large prospective cohort of UK healthcare workers undergoing routine asymptomatic PCR testing. Methods We assessed vaccine effectiveness (VE) (up to 10-months after first dose) and infection-acquired immunity by comparing time to PCR-confirmed infection in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals using a Cox regression-model, adjusted by prior SARS-CoV-2 infection status, vaccine-manufacturer/dosing-interval, demographics and workplace exposures. Results Of 35,768 participants, 27% (n=9,488) had a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccine coverage was high: 97% had two-doses (79% BNT162b2 long-interval, 8% BNT162b2 short-interval, 8% ChAdOx1). There were 2,747 primary infections and 210 reinfections between 07/12/2020 and 21/09/2021. Adjusted VE (aVE) decreased from 81% (95% CI 68%-89%) 14-73 days after dose-2 to 46% (95% CI 22%-63%) >6-months; with no significant difference for short-interval BNT162b2 but significantly lower aVE (50% (95% CI 18%-70%) 14-73 days after dose-2 from ChAdOx1. Protection from infection-acquired immunity showed evidence of waning in unvaccinated follow-up but remained consistently over 90% in those who received two doses of vaccine, even in those infected over 15-months ago. Conclusion Two doses of BNT162b2 vaccination induce high short-term protection to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which wanes significantly after six months. Infection-acquired immunity boosted with vaccination remains high over a year after infection. Boosters will be essential to maintain protection in vaccinees who have not had primary infection to reduce infection and transmission in this population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2021.11.29.21267006     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2021.11.29.21267006&atitle=Effectiveness+and+durability+of+protection+against+future+SARS-CoV-2+infection+conferred+by+COVID-19+vaccination+and+previous+infection%3B+findings+from+the+UK+SIREN+prospective+cohort+study+of+healthcare+workers+March+2020+to+September+2021&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Hall&aufirst=Victoria&auinit=V.&aufull=Hall+V.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2021&auinit1=V&auinitm=,adaptive immunity;adult;cohort analysis;comparative effectiveness;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;demography;drug therapy;female;follow up;health care personnel;human;low drug dose;major clinical study;male;polymerase chain reaction;primary infection;prospective study;reinfection;vaccination;vaccinee;workplace;tozinameran;vaxzevria;Cohort Studies;Vaccination,,

Objective To examine associations between Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination timing and effectiveness. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort study of database records from Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), a major Israeli Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). We included all individuals over 12 with at least one timestamped vaccine dose and no documented COVID-19 infection prior to completing the initial 2-dose immunization series (n=1,515,754, 99.2% receiving BNT162b2). Database records spanned December 19, 2020, to April 25, 2022, encompassing two spikes in COVID infection dominated by the delta (B.1.617.2) and omicron (B.1.1.529) SARS-CoV-2 variants. Main Outcomes and Measures Outcomes included COVID-19 breakthrough infection and COVID-19 associated emergency department (ED) visits. Our main comparison was between patients vaccinated exclusively during morning hours (8:00-11:59), afternoon (12:00-15:59), or evening hours (16:00-19:59). We employed Cox multivariate regression to adjust for differences in age, sex, and co-morbidities. Results. Breakthrough infections differed based on vaccination time, with lowest rates associated with late morning to early afternoon, and highest rates with evening vaccination. Vaccination timing remained significant after adjustment for patient age, sex, and co-morbidities (HR=0.88 afternoon vs. evening, [95% CI 0.87-0.90]). Results were consistent in patients who received the basic two-dose vaccine series and who received booster doses. The relationship between COVID-19 immunization time and breakthrough infection risk was sinusoidal, consistent with a biological rhythm in vaccine effectiveness. Vaccination timing altered breakthrough infection risk by 8.6-25% in our cohort, depending on patient age and dose number. The benefits of daytime vaccination were concentrated in younger and elderly patients. In contrast to breakthrough infections, COVID-19 related ED visits correlated with age and medical comorbidities but not with time of vaccination. Conclusions and Relevance We report a significant association between the time of COVID-19 vaccination and its clinical effectiveness in terms of breakthrough infection. These data have implications for mass vaccination programs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.10.31.22281719     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.10.31.22281719&atitle=BIOLOGICAL+RHYTHMS+IN+COVID-19+VACCINE+EFFECTIVENESS&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Hazan&aufirst=Guy&auinit=G.&aufull=Hazan+G.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=G&auinitm=,age;aged;biological rhythm;breakthrough infection;cohort analysis;communicable disease;comorbidity;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;emergency ward;female;human;immunization;infection risk;major clinical study;male;mass immunization;nonhuman;retrospective study;SARS-CoV-2 Delta;SARS-CoV-2 Omicron;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;spike;vaccination;tozinameran;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

Sterne, Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol, Oakfield House, Oakfield Grove, Bristol, United Kingdom","Background The rate at which COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness wanes over time is crucial for vaccination policies, but is incompletely understood with conflicting results from different studies. Methods This cohort study, using the OpenSAFELY-TPP database and approved by NHS England, included individuals without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection assigned to vaccines priority groups 2-12 defined by the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. We compared individuals who had received two doses of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 with unvaccinated individuals during six 4-week comparison periods, separately for subgroups aged 65+ years; 16-64 years and clinically vulnerable; 40-64 years and 18-39 years. We used Cox regression, stratified by first dose eligibility and geographical region and controlled for calendar time, to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing vaccinated with unvaccinated individuals, and quantified waning vaccine effectiveness as ratios of aHRs per-4-week period. The outcomes were COVID-19 hospitalisation, COVID-19 death, positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and non-COVID-19 death. Findings The BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 and unvaccinated groups comprised 1,773,970, 2,961,011 and 2,433,988 individuals, respectively. Waning of vaccine effectiveness was similar across outcomes and vaccine brands: e.g. in the 65+ years subgroup ratios of aHRs versus unvaccinated for COVID-19 hospitalisation, COVID-19 death and positive SARS-CoV-2 test ranged from 1.23 (95% CI 1.15-1.32) to 1.27 (1.20-1.34) for BNT162b2 and 1.16 (0.98-1.37) to 1.20 (1.14-1.27) for ChAdOx1. Despite waning, rates of COVID-19 hospitalisation and COVID-19 death were substantially lower among vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals up to 26 weeks after second dose, with estimated aHRs <0.20 (>80% vaccine effectiveness) for BNT162b2, and <0.26 (>74%) for ChAdOx1. By weeks 23-26, rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated individuals were similar to or higher than those in unvaccinated individuals: aHRs ranged from 0.85 (0.78-0.92) to 1.53 (1.07-2.18) for BNT162b2, and 1.21 (1.13-1.30) to 1.99 (1.94-2.05) for ChAdOx1. Interpretation The rate at which estimated vaccine effectiveness waned was strikingly consistent for COVID-19 hospitalisation, COVID-19 death and positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and similar across subgroups defined by age and clinical vulnerability. If sustained to outcomes of infection with the Omicron variant and to booster vaccination, these findings will facilitate scheduling of booster vaccination doses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.03.23.22272804     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.03.23.22272804&atitle=Waning+effectiveness+of+BNT162b2+and+ChAdOx1+COVID-19+vaccines+over+six+months+since+second+dose%3A+a+cohort+study+using+linked+electronic+health+records&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Horne&aufirst=Elsie+M.F.&auinit=E.M.F.&aufull=Horne+E.M.F.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=E&auinitm=M.F.,adult;cohort analysis;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;COVID-19 testing;drug therapy;electronic health record;eligibility;female;hospitalization;human;major clinical study;male;revaccination;vulnerability;tozinameran;vaxzevria;Cohort Studies;Vaccination,,

So, we aimed to ascertain the effectiveness of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine among the healthcare workers by characterizing the breakthrough infections which occurred 14 days after the second dose of the vaccine. Methods: We prospectively evaluated the ‘Institutional Covid Vaccination Database’ to categorize the SARS-CoV-2 positive healthcare workers into 2 cohorts: infected vaccinated and infected unvaccinated cohort. Along with comparing the descriptive statistics of the cohorts, the relative risk (RR), relative risk reduction (RRR), and the vaccine effectiveness were calculated. The study population was compared for the significant difference by using the parametric model (binary logistic regression) for the Odds ratio and the non-parametric model (cox proportionality model) for the Hazard ratio. Results: Out of the 324 healthcare workers employed in our institution 243 (75%) were vaccinated. When 6.58% (16) of the vaccinated healthcare workers were tested positive, 43.75% (35) were infected in the unvaccinated cohort and the median time of infection in the vaccinated cohort was 65 days (range 20 -91 days). While the cox proportionality model reveals that the age, sex, and the contact exposure status of the cohort are not significant factors for getting infected after being vaccinated, binary logistic regression proves that a significant relationship exists between the incidence of infection and the unvaccinated status (p = 0.001, OR = 4.278). Completing the two-dose of vaccination decreased the hazard of testing positive for the SARS-CoV-2 by 84.96 % when compared with the unvaccinated individuals, which is the effectiveness of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Conclusion: There is an increased risk of the third wave of COVID-19 infection in the upcoming months. So, primary infection control measures should be followed even if vaccinated, to prevent the risk of breakthrough infections.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1016/j.jval.2022.04.891     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15244733&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.jval.2022.04.891&atitle=EPH140+SARS-COV-2+Breakthrough+Infections+Among+the+Healthcare+Workers+Post-Vaccination+with+ChAdOx1+nCoV-19+Vaccine+in+the+South+Indian+State+of+Kerala&stitle=Value+Health&title=Value+in+Health&volume=25&issue=7&spage=S460&epage=&aulast=Issac&aufirst=A.&auinit=A.&aufull=Issac+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S460-&date=2022&auinit1=A&auinitm=,vaxzevria;adult;breakthrough infection;case report;clinical article;cohort analysis;conference abstract;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;female;health care personnel;human;incidence;infection control;Kerala;male;nonhuman;prevention;primary infection;prospective study;risk factor;risk reduction;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

Data regarding the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on COVID-19 evolution an immunocompromised population are still scarce. Aims: To compare disease severity and mortality in a real-life cohort according to the vaccination status of patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies developing COVID-19 disease. Methods: We retrospectively collected clinical data from the patients with a current or prior history of hematologic malignancy in the last 5 years at Vall d'Hebron Hospital whom suffered a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were unvaccinated between March 2020 and May 2021, and partially or completely vaccinated between May 2021 and January 2022. The primary endpoint was COVID-related mortality according to vaccination status. Secondary endpoints included rate and length of Hospitalization, ICU admission, need for supplemental oxygen including high flow oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation, and severity of COVID-19 disease. Results: Overall, 113 vaccinated and 81 unvaccinated patients developed COVID-19. Both groups were similar in age (median 69 and 72 years, respectively), gender predominance, diagnosis (mainly lymphoproliferative diseases [58% and 53%]), and administered active treatment (mostly anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies [38% and 37%]). In contrast, more patients received active treatment (78% vs. 48%; p=<0.001) in the vaccinated cohort. Vaccinated patients developed infection by the delta variant in 27% (17/62) and by the omicron variant in 73% of the sequenced cases (45/62). Genotype analysis of the variant in unvaccinated cases is ongoing. Despite the fact that 96% of patients received 2 vaccine doses and 73% also a third boost dose, in only 67% (59/88) of patients basal IgG anti-spike antibodies were detected after vaccination. In comparison with the unvaccinated cohort of patients, vaccinated patients had less severe (17% vs. 42%; p=0.01) and critical (13% vs 28%; p=0.03) COVID-19 infection, lower rates of Hospitalization (42% vs. 90%; p=<0.001) with shorter length of stay (median 13 days (IQR 7-34) vs. 11 days (IQR 6-16), and fewer patients needed supplemental oxygen (34% vs. 73%; p=0). Admission rates to ICU were similar between both cohorts. Finally, mortality rate was lower in the vaccinated patients in comparison with the unvaccinated cohort (HR: 0.19 (95%CI 0.09, 0.38); p= <0.001). Of note, in Hospitalized patients only, the mortality of the vaccinated cohort was also lower (HR: 0.38 (95%CI 0.19, 0.76); p=0.007). Among vaccinated patients who suffered a severe/critical infection, 52% did not have vaccine seroconversion. Of the vaccinated patients who died (11/113), 6/8 had negative anti-S IgG, 5/9 were infected by the delta variant and 4/9 by omicron, and 10/11 were on active treatment (5/11 with monoclonal antibodies). (Figure Presented ) Summary/Conclusion: In our series, despite the heterogeneity of infection by different viral variants and treatment availability for COVID- 19 during the evolution of the pandemic, vaccination has been widely effective at reducing need of Hospitalization, severity and mortality of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in hematological patients. Nevertheless, a subgroup of vaccinated patients remains with an adverse outcome and requires further identification and management improvement.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1097/01.HS9.0000852292.38263.b8     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=25729241&id=doi:10.1097%2F01.HS9.0000852292.38263.b8&atitle=A+SINGLE+CENTER+COMPARATIVE+CLINICAL+ANALYSIS+OF+THE+SARS-COV-2+INFECTION+BEFORE+AND+AFTER+VACCINATION+IN+PATIENTS+DIAGNOSED+WITH+HEMATOLOGIC+MALIGNANCIES&stitle=HemaSphere&title=HemaSphere&volume=6&issue=&spage=2792&epage=2793&aulast=Jim%C3%A9nez&aufirst=Moraima&auinit=M.&aufull=Jim%C3%A9nez+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=2792-2793&date=2022&auinit1=M&auinitm=,CD20 antibody;endogenous compound;immunoglobulin G;monoclonal antibody;oxygen;vaccine;adult;adverse outcome;artificial ventilation;cancer patient;clinical evaluation;cohort analysis;conference abstract;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;female;gender;gene frequency;genotype;hematologic malignancy;high flow nasal cannula therapy;hospital patient;hospitalization;human;length of stay;lymphoproliferative disease;major clinical study;male;mortality;mortality rate;nonhuman;outcome assessment;pandemic;retrospective study;SARS-CoV-2 Delta;seroconversion;spike;vaccination;vaccinee;virus strain;Hematologic Neoplasms;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

We aimed to study the association between the community prevalence of the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variants and the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines, in participants with cirrhosis. Methods: We performed a test-negative case-control study of patients with cirrhosis who had a SARS COV2 PCR test between February 1, 2021 and January 21, 2022. Participants were considered fully vaccinated 14 days after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine. We also captured participants who received a booster dose of the mRNA vaccine. We excluded liver transplant recipients, those partially vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine, participants with a positive SARS-Co- V- 2 PCR prior to the study period, and those who received the Ad.26.COV2.S vaccine. Association of community prevalence of variants and effectiveness against varying severities of COVID-19 was studied, adjusting for time from vaccination, and receipt of third dose. Outcomes included symptomatic, at least moderate, severe/ critical COVID-19, and COVID-19- related death. Results: Vaccine effectiveness was associated with the community prevalence of variants, the outcome of interest, days from full vaccination, and receipt of the third dose. Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 after 2 months of vaccination was 82% during Alpha (aOR 0.18, 95% CI 0.10-0.32, p<0.0001), 68% during Delta (aOR 0.32, 95% CI 0.23-0.44, p<0.0001), and 0% in the Omicron period (aOR 0.70, 95% CI 0.37-1.35, p=0.29). Vaccine effectiveness 2 months after vaccination against severe/ critical COVID-19 was similar across variant periods- 72% during Alpha (aOR 0.28, 95% CI 0.11-0.72, p=0.01), 75% during Delta (aOR 0.25, 95% CI 0.14-0.43, p<0.0001), and 84% during Omicron (aOR 0.16, 95% CI 0.06-0.46, p=0.001). Vaccine effectiveness decreased with increasing time from vaccination (p-value for interaction<0.0001). Receipt of a third dose was associated with a reduced odds of severe/critical COVID-19 (aOR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32-0.92, p=0.02). Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccination was highly effective against symptomatic COVID-19 during Alpha, and lowest during the Omicron period.

Participants who received three doses of the vaccine (n=13,041) were propensity matched with 13,041 controls who received two doses, and studied between July 18, 2021 and February 11, 2022 when the B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron) were the predominant variants. By assigning a date of the third dose to each matched participant in the two-dose arm, and including date of the second dose and patient location in the matching, the study was able to balance the exposure of participants in the two arms to similar variants. Outcomes were aggregated as all cases with COVID-19, symptomatic COVD-19, with at least moderate COVID-19, or severe or critical COVID-19. Results: Receipt of the third dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was associated with an 80.7% reduction COVID-19 (95% CI 39.2-89.1, p<0.001), 80.4% reduction in symptomatic COVID-19, 80% reduction in moderate/ severe or critical COVID-19, (95% CI 34.5-87.6%, p=0.005), 100% reduction in severe or critical COVID-19 (95% CI 99.2-100.0, p=0.01), and a 100% reduction in COVID-19- related death (95% CI 99.8-100.0, p=0.007), compared to recipients with cirrhosis who received two doses. The magnitude of reduction in COVID-19 was greater with the third dose of the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine than the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine, and in participants with compensated than decompensated cirrhosis. Conclusion: The receipt of the third dose of an mRNA vaccine is associated with an 80% decrease in the development of COVID-19, symptomatic COVID-19, and moderate/severe or critical COVID-19, and a 100% reduction in severe or critical COVID-19 and COVID-19 related death, compared to participants with cirrhosis who received only two doses. The reduction in COVID-19 related outcomes with the third dose is greater than that described in the general population, suggesting that a third dose is able to overcome the vaccine hyporesponsiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in cirrhosis.

The current study aimed to evaluate vaccine performance during second wave in India. It also aimed to determine adverse events of significant concern (AESCs), and to ascertain the effect of vaccination on persistent health issues in individuals post COVID-19. Methods: A cohort study was conducted from July-2021 to December-2021 in a tertiary hospital of north India. The primary outcome was vaccine-effectiveness against COVID-19. Secondary outcomes were AESCs, and persistent health issues in those receiving vaccine. Regression analyses were performed to determine risk factors. Results: In 2760 healthcare workers (HCWs) included, 1033 COVID-19 events were reported. Around 6-17% vaccine effectiveness was observed against COVID-19 occurrence. One dose-recipients were at 1.6-times increased risk of COVID-19. Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was a strong independent protective factor against COVID-19 (aOR 0.66). Full vaccination reduced moderate-severe COVID-19 by 57%. Those with lung disease were at 2.5-times increased risk of moderate-severe COVID-19. AESCs were observed in 1.3% including one case each of myocarditis and severe hypersensitivity. Individuals with hypothyroidism were at 5-times and those receiving vaccine after recovery from COVID-19 were at 3-times higher risk of persistent health issues. Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccination reduced COVID-19 severity but offered marginal protection against occurrence. Relationship of asthma and hypothyroidism with COVID-19 outcomes necessitates focused research. Independent protection of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was high and persistent health issues were common in individuals receiving vaccine post COVID-19. Recommendations of vaccinating those recovered from COVID-19 need further studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.03.26.22272613     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.03.26.22272613&atitle=Persistent+health+issues%2C+adverse+events+of+significant+concern%2C+and+effectiveness+of+COVID-19+vaccination-+findings+from+a+real-world+cohort+study+of+healthcare+workers+in+north+India&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Kaur&aufirst=Upinder&auinit=U.&aufull=Kaur+U.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=U&auinitm=,adult;arthritis;asthma;cohort analysis;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;female;health care personnel;human;hypersensitivity;hypothyroidism;immunization;India;lung disease;major clinical study;male;myocarditis;outcome assessment;pharmacovigilance;risk factor;tertiary care center;vaccination;vaccine;Cohort Studies;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

However, antibodies are surrogate markers of disease protection and absence of seroconversion does not mean complete susceptibility to the disease. We hypothesized that COVID-19 vaccines are effective in liver transplant patients despite low seroconversion rates. Method:We designed a test-negative case-control study to assess the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of COVID-19 vaccination in liver transplant recipients followed at our center in Hamad Medical Corporation. All liver transplant patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1st of February till 30th of July in Qatar were included in the study. Case patients were identified as patients who had positive SARS-CoV-2 test on nasopharyngeal and throat swab while control patients were identified as patients whowere tested negative during the same period. Information regarding demographic and clinical characteristics, transplant history, current immunosuppressive treatment was obtained from the medical records. Also, we recorded the type of COVID-19 vaccination, number of vaccine doses (one or two), COVID-19 complications, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions. VE was estimated by a test-negative case-control design in which symptomatic liver transplant patients who were tested negative for COVID-19 were recorded as controls, while patients who tested positive were considered cases. VE was defined as “1- OR (odds ratio).” Results: A total of 136 liver transplant patients were included in the study. 13 (9.6%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period, out of which 7 (5.2%) needed hospitalization and 5 (3.7%) were admitted to the ICU. None of the patients died. The baseline characteristics, transplant history, comorbid conditions, and current immunosuppressive treatment for the participants is summarized in the table.

Methods Using electronic health records and SARS-CoV-2 laboratory surveillance data, we conducted a case-case and a cohort study covering the period of Omicron BA.2/BA.5 lineage replacement in Portugal, to compare vaccine effectiveness of complete primary and booster dose against infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, and mortality. Variant classification was performed through whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or Spike Gene Target Failure (SGTF). Findings Between April 25 and June 10, 2022, within a total of 27702 collected samples, 55.5% were classified as BA.2 and the remaining as BA.5. We observed no evidence of reduced vaccine effectiveness for the primary complete vaccination (OR=1.07, CI95%:0.93-1.23) or booster dose vaccination (OR=0.96, CI95%:0.84-1.09) against BA.5 infection compared with BA.2.

While a 3-dose mRNA-1273 primary series is recommended for moderately or severely immunocompromised (IC) individuals in the U.S., some IC individuals do not complete the 3-dose series. We conducted a matched cohort study to evaluate the relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of the 3-dose mRNA-1273 primary series vs. 2 doses of mRNA-1273 in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 disease in IC individuals. Methods. IC individuals aged ≥18 years with ≥12 months of Kaiser Permanente Southern California membership who received 3 doses of mRNA-1273 ≥24 days apart were 1:1 matched with randomly selected IC 2-dose recipients on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and 2nd dose date. Third doses were accrued from 08/12/2021 to 12/31/2021, with follow-up through 1/31/2022, spanning the delta and omicron periods. Outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive molecular test or diagnosis code), COVID-19 hospitalization, and COVID-19 hospital death. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models. Adjusted rVE (%) was calculated as (1-aHR) x 100. Results. Our study included 21,942 3-dose and 21,942 2-dose mRNA-1273 IC recipients. Adjusted rVE of 3 doses compared to 2 doses of mRNA-1273 against SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, and COVID-19 hospital death were 55.0% (95% CI: 50.8-58.9%), 83.0% (75.4-88.3%), and 87.1% (30.6-97.6%), respectively (Table 1). Adjusted rVE against SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from 43.0% to 59.1% across subgroups of age, sex, race/ethnicity, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, pregnancy, and comorbidities (Table 2). Point estimates of the 3-dose rVE were higher against COVID-19 infection and hospitalization in the first 3 months, compared to 3-6 months after the 3rd dose (Table 3). Conclusion. Three doses of mRNA-1273 provide additional protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes for IC individuals, compared to 2 doses, highlighting the importance of completing 3-doses for IC populations. However, possible waning of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes after 3 months supports the ACIP recommendation of a booster dose at least 3 months after the 3rd primary series dose for adequate protection of IC individuals.

Design: A case-control study of 11,690 hospitalized adults. Setting: Twenty-one hospitals across the United States. Participants: This study included 5728 cases hospitalized with COVID-19 and 5962 controls hospitalized without COVID-19. Cases were classified into SARS-CoV-2 variant groups based on viral whole genome sequencing, and if sequencing did not reveal a lineage, by the predominant circulating variant at the time of hospital admission: Alpha (March 11 to July 3, 2021), Delta (July 4 to December 25, 2021), and Omicron (December 26, 2021 to January 14, 2022). Main Outcome Measures: Vaccine effectiveness was calculated using a test-negative design for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to prevent COVID-19 hospitalizations by each variant (Alpha, Delta, Omicron). Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, disease severity on the WHO Clinical Progression Ordinal Scale was compared among variants using proportional odds regression. Results: Vaccine effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines to prevent COVID-19-associated hospitalizations included: 85% (95% CI: 82 to 88%) for 2 vaccine doses against Alpha; 85% (95% CI: 83 to 87%) for 2 doses against Delta; 94% (95% CI: 92 to 95%) for 3 doses against Delta; 65% (95% CI: 51 to 75%) for 2 doses against Omicron; and 86% (95% CI: 77 to 91%) for 3 doses against Omicron. Among hospitalized unvaccinated COVID-19 patients, severity on the WHO Clinical Progression Scale was higher for Delta than Alpha (adjusted proportional odds ratio [aPOR] 1.28, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.46), and lower for Omicron than Delta (aPOR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.77). Compared to unvaccinated cases, severity was lower for vaccinated cases for each variant, including Alpha (aPOR 0.33, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.49), Delta (aPOR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.51), and Omicron (aPOR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.85). Conclusions: mRNA vaccines were highly effective in preventing COVID-19-associated hospitalizations from Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants, but three vaccine doses were required to achieve protection against Omicron similar to the protection that two doses provided against Delta and Alpha. Among adults hospitalized with COVID-19, Omicron caused less severe disease than Delta, but still resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality. Vaccinated patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had significantly lower disease severity than unvaccinated patients for all the variants.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1101/2022.02.06.22270558     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.02.06.22270558&atitle=Clinical+Severity+and+mRNA+Vaccine+Effectiveness+for+Omicron%2C+Delta%2C+and+Alpha+SARS-CoV-2+Variants+in+the+United+States%3A+A+Prospective+Observational+Study&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Lauring&aufirst=Adam+S.&auinit=A.S.&aufull=Lauring+A.S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=A&auinitm=S,adult;case control study;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;female;hospital admission;hospital patient;hospitalization;human;major clinical study;male;morbidity;mortality;nonhuman;observational study;outcome assessment;prevention;prospective study;SARS-CoV-2 Delta;SARS-CoV-2 Omicron;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;United States;vaccinee;whole genome sequencing;RNA vaccine;SARS-CoV-2 vaccine,,

Lev Zion, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Jerusalem, Israel","Background: Some studies have shown decreased serological response to vaccination in patients on anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) medications. While the large majority of these patients do seroconvert after vaccination, titers have generally been lower and one study showed reduced neutralizing and inhibitory functions. One real-world population- based study compared found no increased infection rate in anti- TNF treated patients, but infection rates were low. The low event rate mandates exploration in longer-term population-based data. We used the epi-Israeli IBD Research Nucleus (IIRN) database to explore the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in IBD patients in Israel. Methods: We included all IBD patients insured in two of the four Israeli HMOs, covering 35% of the population, by validated algorithms, and selected those who received two doses of Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine. These were matched by date of vaccination ±3 days and demographic variables to non-IBD controls. The primary outcome was incidence of positive COVID-19 PCR following vaccination between December, 2020 to June, 2021. Results: 12,640 IBD patients received two vaccine doses; the matched cohort included 4,946 matched pairs (total 9,892 subjects). Mean age was 50.5±16.1 years and median follow-up was 22 weeks (range 4.1-24.4). Fifteen (0.3%) vaccinated IBD patients tested positive compared with 15 (0.3%) vaccinated non-IBD controls (OR=1 [95%CI 0.49-2.05], p=1.0). Patients on anti-TNF and/or corticosteroids did not have a higher incidence of positivity - neither compared to the entire group nor to IBD patients treated with vedolizumab/ustekinumab, even after precise matching for demographics, underlying diseases and IBD severity. Conclusion: In a large population-based cohort of IBD patients in Israel, vaccine effectiveness was equivalent to non-IBD controls and was not influenced by treatment with anti-TNF or corticosteroids. Notwithstanding previous findings of impaired serological response in anti-TNF treated IBD patients, this real-world large-scale study shows that vaccine protection is robust in IBD patients, including those on immunosuppressive medications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjab232.065     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18764479&id=doi:10.1093%2Fecco-jcc%2Fjjab232.065&atitle=COVID-19+vaccine+effectiveness+in+inflammatory+bowel+disease+patients+on+tumor-necrosis+factor+inhibitors%3A+Real+world+data+from+a+massvaccination+campaign&stitle=J.+Crohn%27s+Colitis&title=Journal+of+Crohn%27s+and+Colitis&volume=16&issue=&spage=i078&epage=i079&aulast=Lev+Zion&aufirst=R.&auinit=R.&aufull=Lev+Zion+R.&coden=&isbn=&pages=i078-i079&date=2022&auinit1=R&auinitm=,corticosteroid;endogenous compound;tozinameran;tumor necrosis factor;tumor necrosis factor inhibitor;ustekinumab;vedolizumab;adult;algorithm;cohort analysis;conference abstract;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;demographics;drug combination;drug therapy;female;follow up;human;incidence;inflammatory bowel disease;Israel;major clinical study;male;middle aged;outcome assessment;vaccination;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Vaccination,,

Morbidity and mortality of this disease in kidney transplant patients are higher than in the general population. As the vaccination response of transplant patients is weak, serological monitoring was performed. In this cohort study, we analyzed the determinants of vaccination response. All patients had no history of COVID-19. With anti-spike IgG monitoring, 148 responders and 415 non-responders were identified. We compared both groups using multivariate analyses of the cohort and a sub-cohort of mycophenolic-acid-treated patients. We investigated the influence of patient characteristics, immunosuppression, and erythrocyte inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) activity. In responders, the time after transplantation was longer (13.5 vs. 8.5 years), the glomerular filtration rate was higher (56.9 vs. 47.8 mL/min/1.73 m2), and responders were younger (53.0 vs. 57.4 years). Heterologous vaccination was more effective than homologous vaccination. Calcineurin inhibitors plus mycophenolate reduced the seroconversion rate. No seroconversion was observed in belatacept patients. In mycophenolate-treated patients, IMPDH activity was a significantly better predictor of response than mycophenolate dose (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.62, p <0.001).

Although COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for at-risk populations, the vaccine effectiveness in people living with HIV (PLWH) remains incompletely understood. We evaluated the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination among PLWH during a COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan. Methods: From 1 March to 30 September, 2021, all adult PLWH without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were included and advised to receive 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine. The government-funded vaccination campaign provided different types of COVID-19 vaccine, including ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and MVC-COV1901 (Medigen) vaccines. The primary endpoint of this study was the vaccine effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 among PLWH, which was estimated by comparing incidence rates between the unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated groups in a dynamic cohort. Results: During the study period, 3131 PLWH were included, with 99.9% on antiretroviral therapy, 99.8% being MSM and median CD4 count of 627 cells/mm3. In the dynamic cohort, 3128 PLWH contributed 516892 person-days of follow-up (PDFU) to the unvaccinated group, 2476 PLWH contributed 139163 PDFU to the partially vaccinated group, and 236 PLWH contributed 12011 PDFU to the fully vaccinated group (Table). During the follow-up, 37 PLWH (1.2%) acquired SARS-CoV-2 infections. The incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 6.4 per 100,000 PDFU in the unvaccinated group, which decreased to 2.9 and 0 per 100,000 PDFU in the partially and fully vaccinated groups, respectively. The adjusted incidence rate ratios were 0.47 (95% CI, 0.17-1.32) in the partially vaccinated group and <0.01 in the fully vaccinated group compared with the unvaccinated group, resulting in vaccine effectiveness rates of 53.4% and 99.9% for single-and 2-dose COVID-19 vaccination, respectively.

Here, we use whole-genome-sequencing (WGS) to tease apart the contribution of these factors on the decline observed following the introduction of the Delta variant. Further, we evaluate the utility of calendar-period-based variant classification as an alternative to WGS. Methods: We conducted a test-negative-case-control study among people who received SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing in the Yale New Haven Health System between April 1 and August 24, 2021. Variant classification was performed using WGS and secondarily by calendar-period. We estimated VE as one minus the ratio comparing the odds of infection among vaccinated and unvaccinated people. Results: Overall, 2,029 cases (RT-PCR positive, sequenced samples) and 343,985 controls (negative RT-PCRs) were included. VE 14-89 days after 2nd dose was significantly higher against WGS-classified Alpha infection (84.4%, 95% confidence interval: 75.6-90.0%) than Delta infection (68.9%, CI: 58.0-77.1%, p-value: 0.013).

While estimates of VE against calendar-period-classified infections approximated estimates against WGS-classified infections, calendar-period-based classification was subject to outcome misclassification (35% during Alpha period, 4% during Delta period). Conclusions: These findings suggest that both waning protection and variant-specific immune evasion contributed to the lower effectiveness. While estimates of VE against calendar-period-classified infections mirrored that against WGS-classified infections, our analysis highlights the need for WGS when variants are co-circulating and misclassification is likely.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1101/2022.08.25.22278443     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.08.25.22278443&atitle=Use+of+whole+genome+sequencing+to+estimate+the+contribution+of+immune+evasion+and+waning+immunity+to+decreasing+COVID-19+vaccine+effectiveness+during+alpha+and+delta+variant+waves&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Lind&aufirst=Margaret+L.&auinit=M.L.&aufull=Lind+M.L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=M&auinitm=L,case control study;comparative effectiveness;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;hepatitis D;human;immune evasion;major clinical study;nonhuman;SARS-CoV-2 Delta;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;whole genome sequencing;SARS-CoV-2 vaccine,,

Objective: To estimate the effectiveness of primary (two-dose) and booster (third dose) vaccination against Omicron infection among people with a prior documented infection. Design: Test-negative case-control study. Setting: Yale New Haven Health System facilities. Participants: Vaccine eligible people who received SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing between November 1, 2021, and January 31, 2022. Measurements: We conducted two analyses, each with an outcome of Omicron BA.1 infection (S-gene target failure defined) and each stratified by prior SARS-CoV-2 infection status. We estimated the effectiveness of primary and booster vaccination. To test whether booster vaccination reduced the risk of infection beyond that of the primary series, we compared the odds among boosted and booster eligible people. Results: Overall, 10,676 cases and 119,397 controls were included (6.1% and 7.8% occurred following a prior infection, respectively). The effectiveness of primary vaccination 14-149 days after 2nd dose was 36.1% (CI, 7.1% to 56.1%) for people with and 28.5% (CI, 20.0% to 36.2%) without prior infection. The odds ratio comparing boosted and booster eligible people with prior infection was 0.83 (CI, 0.56 to 1.23), whereas the odds ratio comparing boosted and booster eligible people without prior infection was 0.51 (CI, 0.46 to 0.56). Limitations: Misclassification, residual confounding, reliance on TaqPath assay analyzed samples. Conclusion: While primary vaccination provided protection against BA.1 infection among people with and without prior infection, booster vaccination was only associated with additional protection in people without prior infection. These findings support primary vaccination in people regardless of prior infection status but suggest that infection history should be considered when evaluating the need for booster vaccination.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1101/2022.04.19.22274056     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.04.19.22274056&atitle=Effectiveness+of+Primary+and+Booster+COVID-19+mRNA+Vaccination+against+Omicron+Variant+SARS-CoV-2+Infection+in+People+with+a+Prior+SARS-CoV-2+Infection&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Lind&aufirst=Margaret+L.&auinit=M.L.&aufull=Lind+M.L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=M&auinitm=L,"adult;case control study;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;female;human;major clinical study;male;nonhuman;outcome assessment;revaccination;SARS-CoV-2 Omicron;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;treatment failure;vaccination;messenger RNA;vaccine;RNA, Messenger;Vaccination",,

Objective: To evaluate the association between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination with 2, 3, or 4 doses among immunocompetent adults and the risk of medically attended COVID-19 illness during a period of BA.4/BA.5 predominant circulation; to evaluate the relative severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized cases across Omicron BA.1, BA.2/BA.2.12.1, and BA.4/BA.5 sublineage periods. Setting, Design and Participants: Test-negative study of adults with COVID-19-like illness (CLI) and molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 conducted in 10 states from December 16, 2021, to August 20, 2022. Exposure: mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Main Outcomes and Measures: Emergency department/urgent care encounters, hospitalizations, and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or in-hospital death. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the association between prior vaccination and medically attended COVID-19 was used to estimate VE, stratified by care setting and vaccine doses (2, 3, or 4 doses vs 0 doses as reference group). Among hospitalized case-patients, demographic and clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes including ICU admission and death were compared across sublineage periods. Results: Between June 19 – August 20, 2022, 82,229 ED/UC and 21,007 hospital encounters were included for the BA.4/BA.5 vaccine effectiveness analysis. Among adults hospitalized with CLI, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.68-0.83) for receipt of 2 vaccine doses at ≥150 days after receipt, 0.32 (95% CI: 0.20-0.50) for a third dose 7-119 days after receipt, and 0.64 (95% CI: 0.58-0.71) for a third dose ≥120 days (median 235 days) after receipt for cases vs controls. For COVID-19-associated hospitalization, among patients ages ≥65 years 7-59 and ≥60 days (median 88 days) after a fourth dose, ORs were 0.34 (95% CI: 0.25-0.47) and 0.43 (95% CI: 0.34-0.56), respectively. Among hospitalized cases, ICU admission and/or in-hospital death occurred in 21.4% during the BA.1 vs 14.7% during the BA.4/BA.5 period (standardized mean difference: 0.17).

Machado, Epidemiology Department, Instituto Nacional de Saúde Doutor Ricardo Jorge, Portugal","Background: Using data from electronic health registries, this study intended to estimate the COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in the population aged 65 years and more, against symptomatic infection, COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths, overall and by time since complete vaccination. Methods: We stablished a cohort of individuals aged 65 and more years old, resident in Portugal mainland, using the National Health Service unique identifier User number to link eight electronic health registries. Outcomes included were symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, COVID-19 related hospitalizations or deaths. The exposures of interest were the mRNA vaccines (Cominarty or Spikevax) and the viral vector Vaxzevria vaccine. Complete scheme vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated as one minus the confounder adjusted hazard ratio, for each outcome, estimated by time-dependent Cox regression with time dependent vaccine exposure. Results: For the cohort of individuals aged 65-79 years, complete scheme VE against symptomatic infection varied between 43% (Vaxzevria) and 65% (mRNA vaccines). This estimate was slightly lower in the ≥80 year cohort (53% for mRNA vaccines. VE against COVID-19 hospitalization varied between 89% (95%CI: 52-94) for Vaxzevria and 95% (95%CI: 93-97) for mRNA vaccines for the cohort aged 65-79 years and was 76% (95%CI: 67-83) for mRNA vaccines in the ≥80 year cohort. High VE against COVID-19 related deaths were estimated, for both vaccine types, 95% and 81% for the 65-79 years and the ≥80 year cohort, respectively. We observed a significant waning of VE against symptomatic infection, with VE estimates reaching approximately 34% for both vaccine types and cohorts. Significant waning was observed for the COVID-19 hospitalizations in the ≥80 year cohort (decay from 83% 14-41 days to 63% 124 days after mRNA second dose). No significant waning effect was observed for COVID-19 related deaths in the period of follow-up of either cohorts. Conclusions: In a population with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 complications, we observed higher overall VE estimates against more severe outcomes for both age cohorts when compared to symptomatic infections. Considering the analysis of VE according to time since complete vaccination, the results showed a waning effect for both age cohorts in symptomatic infection and COVID-19 hospitalization for the 80 and more yo cohort.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2021.12.10.21267619     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2021.12.10.21267619&atitle=COVID-19+vaccine+effectiveness+against+laboratory+confirmed+symptomatic+SARS-CoV-2+infection%2C+COVID-19+related+hospitalizations+and+deaths%2C+among+individuals+aged+65+years+or+more+in+Portugal%3A+A+cohort+study+based+on+data-linkage+of+national+registries+February-September+2021&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Machado&aufirst=Ausenda&auinit=A.&aufull=Machado+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2021&auinit1=A&auinitm=,aged;cohort analysis;comparative effectiveness;complication;confounding variable;controlled study;drug therapy;female;follow up;hospitalization;human;male;national health service;nonhuman;Portugal;resident;risk assessment;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;messenger RNA;RNA vaccine;vaxzevria;Cohort Studies;Vaccination;Registries,,

Methods: We used the US Department of Veterans Affairs COVID-19 Shared Data Resource to identify veterans who utilize VA health care and had no documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection before December 11, 2020. Using a test-negative case-control design (TND), we used conditional logistic regression with adjustment for covariates to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) over time for veterans who received 2 doses of mRNA vaccines or 1 dose of Ad26.Cov2.S. Results: We identified 4.8 million veterans with a mean age of 64 years, of whom 58% had ≥1 chronic disease. Vaccine effectiveness for symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and ICU admission or death declined over time and varied by the type of vaccine (P < 0.01).

Vaccination against other viruses is known to be less effective in these patients compared to the general population. Data on the titers of antibody following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in these patients is inconsistent. The efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to prevent severe disease in ESKD patients with COVID-19 remain unknown. We compared the incidence of hospitalization and COVID-19 related death after COVID-19 disease in dialysis patients based on SARSCoV- 2 vaccine status. Methods: Single-center, retrospective cohort study. We included all adults on dialysis (in-center and home) within the Mayo Clinic Health System in the Midwest (USA) with laboratory proven SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1/1/2020 and 3/30/2022 (n=225). Patients' demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory data including SARS-CoV2 infection test results, and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination information were collected. The primary outcome was the incidence of hospitalization and COVID-19 related death after COVID-19 disease. Results: 244 infections occurred in 225 patients, 119 (49%) were vaccinated and 8.4% (n=19) died. Among those who died, 73.7% (n=14) were not vaccinated compared to 49.3% of those who were alive (p=0.041). A total of 78 patients had 83 hospitalizations; 71.1% were not vaccinated compared to 41% not hospitalized (p<0.001) (Table). Conclusions: The incidence of hospitalization and COVID-19 related death after COVID-19 disease was significantly higher in non-vaccinated compared to vaccinated dialysis patients. This data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination improves outcomes in dialysis patients who develop COVID-19 disease.

Hadlock, Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA, United States","Background: It is important to understand how BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and JNJ-78436735 COVID-19 vaccines, as well as prior infection, protect against breakthrough cases and reinfections. Real world evidence on acquired immunity from vaccines, and from SARS-CoV-2 infection, can help public health decision-makers understand disease dynamics and viral escape to inform resource allocation for curbing the spread of pandemic. Methods: This retrospective cohort study presents demographic information, survival functions, and probability distributions for 2,627,914 patients who received recommended doses of COVID-19 vaccines, and 63,691 patients who had a prior COVID-19 infection. In addition, patients receiving different vaccines were matched by age, sex, ethnic group, state of residency, and the quarter of the year in 2021 the COVID-19 vaccine was completed, to support survival analysis on pairwise matched cohorts. Findings: Each of the three vaccines and infection-induced immunity all showed a high probability of survival against breakthrough or reinfection cases (mRNA-1273: 0.997, BNT162b2: 0.997, JNJ-78436735: 0.992, previous infection: 0.965 at 180 days). The incidence rate of reinfection among those unvaccinated and previously infected was higher than that of breakthrough among the vaccinated population (reinfection: 0.9%; breakthrough:0.4%). In addition, 280 vaccinated patients died (0.01% all-cause mortality) within 21 days of the last vaccine dose, and 5898 (3.1 %) died within 21 days of a positive COVID-19 test. Conclusions: Despite a gradual decline in vaccine-induced and infection-induced immunity, both acquired immunities were highly effective in preventing breakthrough and reinfection. In addition, for unvaccinated patients with COVID-19, those who did not die within 90 days of their initial infection (9565 deaths, 5.0% all-cause mortality rate), had a comparable asymptotic pattern of breakthrough infection as those who acquired immunity from a vaccine. Overall, the risks associated with COVID-19 infection are far greater than the marginal advantages of immunity acquired by prior infection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.02.07.22270613     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.02.07.22270613&atitle=Time+to+reinfection+and+vaccine+breakthrough+SARS-CoV-2+infections%3A+a+retrospective+cohort+study&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Molani&aufirst=Sevda&auinit=S.&aufull=Molani+S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=S&auinitm=,adaptive immunity;adult;all cause mortality;breakthrough infection;cohort analysis;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;COVID-19 testing;demographics;drug therapy;ethnic group;female;human;immunization;incidence;major clinical study;male;nonhuman;probability;reinfection;retrospective study;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;survival analysis;vaccinee;ibacovavec;elasomeran;tozinameran;Cohort Studies;Vaccination,,

Methods In this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we analysed data from 115,775 CYP aged 12-17 years, proxy-reported through the Covid Symptom Study (CSS) smartphone application. We calculated post-vaccination infection risk after one dose of BNT162b2, and described the illness profile of CYP with post-vaccination SARSCoV-2 infection, compared to unvaccinated CYP, and post-vaccination side-effects. Findings Between August 5, 2021 and February 14, 2022, 25,971 UK CYP aged 12-17 years received one dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. Vaccination reduced (proxy-reported) infection risk (-80·4% and -53·7% at 14–30 days with Delta and Omicron variants respectively, and -61·5% and -63·7% after 61–90 days). The probability of remaining infection-free diverged soon after vaccination, and was greater in CYP with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccinated CYP who contracted SARS-CoV-2 during the Delta period had milder disease than unvaccinated CYP; during the Omicron period this was only evident in children aged 12-15 years. Overall disease profile was similar in both vaccinated and unvaccinated CYP. Post-vaccination local side-effects were common, systemic side-effects were uncommon, and both resolved quickly. Interpretation One dose of BNT162b2 vaccine reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for at least 90 days in CYP aged 12-17 years. Vaccine protection varied for SARS-CoV-2 variant type (lower for Omicron than Delta variant), and was enhanced by pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severity of COVID-19 presentation after vaccination was generally milder, although unvaccinated CYP also had generally mild disease. Overall, vaccination was well-tolerated.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.03.13.22272176     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.03.13.22272176&atitle=Vaccination+against+SARS-CoV-2+in+UK+school-aged+children+and+young+people+decreases+infection+rates+and+reduces+COVID-19+symptoms&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Molteni&aufirst=Erika&auinit=E.&aufull=Molteni+E.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=E&auinitm=,adolescent;child;cohort analysis;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;female;human;infection rate;infection risk;major clinical study;male;nonhuman;pediatrics;probability;prospective study;risk assessment;SARS-CoV-2 Delta;SARS-CoV-2 Omicron;school child;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;side effect;smartphone;vaccination;tozinameran;Only Child;Vaccination;Child;Vaccines,,

Design: Multivariate modeling of data from electronic medical records Setting: 130 medical centers of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs Participants: 339,772 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by nucleic acid amplification testing as of September 30, 2021 Methods: The primary outcome was death within 60 days of the diagnosis. Patients were considered vaccinated if they had completed a full series >= 14 days prior to diagnosis. Cases presenting in July - September of 2021 were considered to have the delta variant. Logistic regression was used to derive adjusted odds ratios (OR) for vaccination and infection with delta versus earlier variants. Models were adjusted for demographic traits, standard comorbidity indices, selected clinical terms, and 3 novel parameters representing all prior diagnoses, all prior vital signs/baseline laboratory tests, and current outpatient treatment. Patients with a delta infection were divided into 8 cohorts based upon the time from vaccination to diagnosis (in 4-week blocks). A common model was used to estimate the odds of death associated with vaccination for each cohort relative that of all unvaccinated patients. Results: 9.1% of subjects had been fully vaccinated, and 21.5% were presumed to have the delta variant. 18,120 patients (5.33%) died within 60 days of their diagnoses. The adjusted OR for delta infection was 1.87 +/- 0.05 which corresponds to a relative risk of 1.78. The overall adjusted OR for prior vaccination was 0.280 +/- 0.011 corresponding to a relative risk of 0.291. The study of vaccine cohorts with a delta infection showed that the raw CFR rose steadily after 10-14 weeks. However, the OR for vaccination remained stable for 10-34 weeks. Conclusions: Our study confirms that delta is substantially more lethal than earlier variants and that vaccination is an effective means of preventing COVID death. After adjusting for major selection biases, we found no evidence that the benefits of vaccination on CFR declined over 34 weeks.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.01.22.22269689     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.01.22.22269689&atitle=SUSTAINED+BENEFICIAL+EFFECTS+OF+VACCINATION+ON+THE+CASE+FATALITY+RATE+FOR+COVID-19+INFECTIONS&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Murata&aufirst=Glen+H.&auinit=G.H.&aufull=Murata+G.H.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=G&auinitm=H,adult;case fatality rate;comorbidity;comparative effectiveness;confounding variable;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;demographics;disease simulation;electronic medical record;environmental factor;ethnicity;female;gender;hepatitis D;human;ICD-10;laboratory test;major clinical study;male;mortality;nonhuman;nucleic acid amplification techniques;outcome assessment;outpatient;prevention;race;risk factor;SARS-CoV-2 Delta;vaccination;veteran;vital sign;vaccine;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

Mziou, National Observatory of New and Emerging Diseases Tunisia, Tunisia","Introduction/ Background: In response to the pandemic, multiple vaccines to protect against COVID-19 disease have been unrivalled in the history of public health. Precise estimates of vaccine effectiveness (VE) vary according to studies design, outcomes measured and circulating variants. The aim of this study is to evaluate the anti-covid-19 vaccine effectiveness in Tunisia. Methods: We conducted a matched case-control study from 02 to 15 August 2021. Cases and controls were subjects older than 60 years, selected from the database of testing at the National Observatory of New and Emerging Diseases, regardless vaccine status. A sample of 977 matched peers for age and gender were included. A standardized questionnaire was administered for cases and controls to collect information about vaccination status. The odds-ratio was calculated using simple conditional logistic regression. The VE (95% confidence intervals) was calculated as (1 - odds ratio for vaccination) × 100%. Results: The vaccine effectiveness was 84.2% (95%CI [70.3%- 97.2%]). In our sample, 68.1% of the male population and 56.4% of the female population were vaccinated with a vaccine effectiveness of 84.2% (95%CI [63.2%- 96.3%]) for men and 86.3% (95%CI [68.1%-95.7%]) for women. Vaccine Effectiveness was the highest among age group [60-70[ years 88.0% (95%CI [68.9%-91.5%]). Vaccine effectiveness in prevention from severe forms (treated with oxygen-therapy or necessity of Intensive-care-unit) was 94.5% IC [72.2%-96.3%]. Impact: Our study aims to strengthen anti-covid-19 vaccination efforts as it reduces the spread of the disease (including infection without symptoms) and helps protect from severe forms including hospitalization and death. Difference estimates (depending on the unvaccinated group absolute incidence) provide further evidence of the possible public health value of vaccines. Conclusion: The results of our study imply that the anti-Covid-19 vaccines used in Tunisia are effective in preventing SARS-COV-2 infections and severe forms of COVID-19. This study provided important data on the 'realworld' performance of vaccines that guide decisions about vaccine sustained use.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: case-control",,SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;adult;case control study;comparative effectiveness;conference abstract;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;female;gender;groups by age;hospitalization;human;incidence;intensive care unit;male;oxygen therapy;prevention;public health;questionnaire;Tunisia;vaccination;Case-Control Studies;Vaccination,,

To tackle rising infections, the UK accelerated booster vaccination programmes used mRNA vaccines irrespective of an individual's primary course vaccine type with booster doses rolled out according to clinical priority. There is limited understanding of the effectiveness of different primary vaccination courses on mRNA based booster vaccines against SARs-COV-2 infections and how time-varying confounders can impact the evaluations comparing different vaccines as primary courses for mRNA boosters. Objective To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of ChAdOx1 versus BNT162b2 as primary doses against SARs-CoV-2 in booster vaccine recipients whilst accounting for time-varying confounders. Design Trial emulation was used to reduce time-varying confounding-by-indication driven by prioritising booster vaccines based upon age, vulnerability and exposure status e.g. healthcare worker. Trial emulation was conducted by meta-analysing eight cohort results whose booster vaccinations were staggered between 16/09/2021 to 05/01/2022 and followed until 23/01/2022. Time from booster vaccination until SARS-CoV-2 infection, loss of follow-up or end-of-study was modelled using Cox proportional hazards models for each cohort and adjusted for age, sex, minority ethnic status, clinically vulnerability, and deprivation. Setting Prospective observational study using the Virus Watch community cohort in England and Wales. Participants People over the age of 18 years who had their booster vaccination between 16/09/2021 to 05/01/2022 without prior natural immunity. Exposures ChAdOx1 versus BNT162b2 as a primary dose, and an mRNA booster vaccine. Results Across eight cohorts, 19,692 mRNA vaccine boosted participants were analysed with 12,036 ChAdOx1 and 7,656 BNT162b2 primary courses with a median follow-up time of 73 days (IQR:54-90). Median age, clinical vulnerability status and infection rates fluctuate through time. 7.2% (n=864) of boosted adults with ChAdOx1 primary course experienced a SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to 7.6% (n=582) of those with BNT162b2 primary course during follow-up. The pooled adjusted hazard ratio was 0.99 [95%CI:0.88-1.11], demonstrating no difference between the incidence of SARs-CoV-2 infections based upon the primary vaccine course. Conclusion and Relevance In mRNA boosted individuals, we found no difference in protection comparing those with a primary course of BNT162b2 to those with aChAdOx1 primary course. This contrasts with pre-booster findings where previous research shows greater effectiveness of BNT162b2 than ChAdOx1 in preventing infection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.02.04.22270479     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.02.04.22270479&atitle=Comparative+effectiveness+of+different+primary+vaccination+courses+on+mRNA+based+booster+vaccines+against+SARs-COV-2+infections%3A+A+time-varying+cohort+analysis+using+trial+emulation+in+the+Virus+Watch+community+cohort&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Nguyen&aufirst=Vincent+Grigori&auinit=V.G.&aufull=Nguyen+V.G.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=V&auinitm=G,"adult;adverse drug reaction;clinical trial;cohort analysis;comparative effectiveness;confounding variable;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;England;ethnic group;female;follow up;health care personnel;human;incidence;infection rate;innate immunity;major clinical study;male;nonhuman;observational study;prevention;prospective study;revaccination;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;side effect;vaccination;vulnerability;Wales;young adult;messenger RNA;RNA vaccine;tozinameran;vaxzevria;Vaccination;RNA, Messenger",,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, that is, in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, during periods with different dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants. Methods: A nationwide cohort study design including all individuals with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, who were alive and residing in Denmark between 1 January 2020 and 31 January 2022 were used. Using Danish nationwide registries, we obtained information on SARS-CoV-2 infections, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination, age, sex, comorbidity, staying at hospital and region of affiliation. The study population included were individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Crude and adjusted estimates of VE against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Poisson and Cox regression models, respectively. The VE estimates were calculated separately for three periods with different dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants (Alpha (B.1.1.7), Delta (B.1.617.2), or Omicron (B.1.1.529)) and by time since vaccination using unvaccinated as the reference. Findings: The study population comprised of 209,814 individuals infected before or during the Alpha period, 292,978 before or during the Delta period and 245,530 before or during the Omicron period. Of these, 40,281 individuals had completed their primary vaccination series during the Alpha period (19.2%), 190,026 during the Delta period (64.9%) and 158,563 during the Omicron period (64.6%). VE against reinfection following any COVID-19 vaccine type administered in Denmark, peaked at 85% (95% CI: 37% to 97%) at 104 days or more after vaccination during the Alpha period, 88% (95% CI: 81% to 92%) 14-43 days after vaccination during the Delta period and 60% (95% CI: 58% to 62%) 14-43 days after vaccination during the Omicron period. Waning immunity was observed, and was most pronounced during the Omicron period. Interpretation: This study shows that, in previously infected individuals, completing a primary vaccination series was associated with a significant protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection compared with no vaccination for all three variant periods. Even though vaccination seems to protect to a lesser degree against reinfection with the Omicron variant, these findings are of public health relevance as they show that previously infected individuals still benefit from COVID-19 vaccination in all three variant periods.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.06.01.22275858     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.06.01.22275858&atitle=Vaccine+effectiveness+against+SARS-CoV-2+reinfection+during+periods+of+Alpha+%28B.1.1.7%29%2C+Delta+%28B.1.617.2%29+or+Omicron+%28B.1.1.529%29+dominance%3A+A+Danish+nationwide+study&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Nielsen&aufirst=Katrine+Finderup&auinit=K.F.&aufull=Nielsen+K.F.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=K&auinitm=F,adult;adverse drug reaction;cohort analysis;comorbidity;comparative effectiveness;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;Denmark;drug therapy;female;human;immunity;major clinical study;male;multicenter study;nonhuman;public health;reinfection;SARS-CoV-2 Alpha;SARS-CoV-2 Delta;SARS-CoV-2 Omicron;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;side effect;vaccination;SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

We assessed the VE of COVID-19 vaccination against COVID-19 hospitalization, while adjusting and stratifying for patient characteristics. Methods: We performed a test-negative case-control study in six Dutch hospitals. The study population consisted of adults eligible for COVID-19 vaccination hospitalized between May 1 and June 28 2021 with respiratory symptoms. Cases were defined as patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR during the first 48 hours of admission or within 14 days prior to hospital admission. Controls were patients tested negative at admission and did not have a positive test during the 2 weeks prior to hospitalization. VE was calculated using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for calendar week, sex, age, comorbidity and nursing home residency. Subgroup analysis was performed for age, sex and different comorbidities. Secondary endpoints were ICU-admission and mortality. Results: 379 cases and 255 controls were included of whom 157 (18%) were vaccinated prior to admission. Five cases (1%) and 40 controls (16%) were fully vaccinated (VE: 93%; 95% CI: 81 – 98), and 40 cases (11%) and 70 controls (27%) were partially vaccinated (VE: 70%; 95% CI: 50-82). A strongly protective effect of vaccination was found in all comorbidity subgroups. No ICU-admission or mortality were reported among fully vaccinated cases.

Nordström, Unit of Geriatric Medicine, Department of Community Medicine and Rehabilitation, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden","Background Real-world evidence on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination against severe disease caused by the omicron variant among adolescents is sparse. In addition, evidence on risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease, and whether vaccination is similarly effective in such risk groups, is unclear. Methods and findings Nationwide registers were used to examine the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination against COVID-19 hospitalisation, and risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalisation in adolescents. The safety analysis included all individuals in Sweden born between 2003-2009 (aged 11.3-19.2 years) given at least one dose of mRNA vaccine (N=645,355), and never vaccinated controls (N=199,022). Outcomes evaluated included all hospitalisations until 5 June 2022. The vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 hospitalisation and associated risk factors was evaluated in adolescents given two doses of mRNA vaccine (N=501,945), as compared to never vaccinated controls (N=170,083), during an omicron predominant period (1 January 2022 to 5 June 2022). The safety analysis showed that COVID-19 mRNA vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of any serious adverse events resulting in hospitalisation. During follow-up, 1.69% of the vaccinated individuals were hospitalised compared to 1.71% of the controls (P=0.29). In the VE analysis, there were 21 cases (0.004%) of COVID-19 hospitalisation among 2-dose recipients and 26 cases (0.015%) among controls, resulting in an estimated VE of 75% (95% CI, 54-86, P<0.001). Strong risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalisation included previous infections (odds ratio [OR], 14.3, 95% CI, 7.7-26.6, P<0.001), and cerebral palsy/development disorders (OR, 12.0, 95% CI, 6.4-22.6, P<0.001), with similar estimates of VE in these subgroups as in the total cohort. The number needed to vaccinate with two doses to prevent one case of COVID-19 hospitalisation was 9,007 in the total cohort and 1,031 in those with previous infections or developmental disorders. None of the individuals hospitalised due to COVID-19 died within 30 days. Conclusions In this nationwide study, COVID-19 mRNA vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of any serious adverse event in adolescents. Two doses were associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation during the omicron predominant period, especially among those with certain predisposing conditions who should be prioritized for vaccination. However, COVID-19 hospitalisation among general adolescents was extremely rare, and additional doses in this population may not be warranted at this stage.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.10.19.22281286     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.10.19.22281286&atitle=Safety+and+effectiveness+of+COVID-19+mRNA+vaccination+and+risk+factors+for+hospitalisation+caused+by+the+omicron+variant+in+0.8+million+adolescents%3A+A+nationwide+cohort+study+in+Sweden&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Nordstr%C3%B6m&aufirst=Peter&auinit=P.&aufull=Nordstr%C3%B6m+P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=P&auinitm=,"adolescent;cerebral palsy;child;clinical assessment;cohort analysis;coronavirus disease 2019;developmental disorder;drug safety;drug therapy;female;follow up;hospitalization;human;major clinical study;male;multicenter study;nonhuman;prevention;risk assessment;risk factor;SARS-CoV-2 Omicron;school child;Sweden;vaccination;messenger RNA;RNA vaccine;Cohort Studies;Adolescent;Vaccination;Risk Factors;RNA, Messenger",,

METHODS We used a case-control, test-negative design to assess vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19 resulting in hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of life-supporting interventions (mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), or death. Between July 1 and October 25, 2021, we screened admission logs for eligible case patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 at 31 hospitals in 23 states. We estimated vaccine effectiveness by comparing the odds of antecedent full vaccination (two doses of BNT162b2) in case patients as compared with two hospital-based control groups: patients who had Covid-19-like symptoms but negative results on testing for SARS-CoV-2 (test-negative) and patients who did not have Covid-19-like symptoms (syndrome-negative). RESULTS A total of 445 case patients and 777 controls were enrolled. Overall, 17 case patients (4%) and 282 controls (36%) had been fully vaccinated. Of the case patients, 180 (40%) were admitted to the ICU, and 127 (29%) required life support; only 2 patients in the ICU had been fully vaccinated. The overall effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine against hospitalization for Covid-19 was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90 to 96); the effectiveness was 95% (95% CI, 91 to 97) among test-negative controls and 94% (95% CI, 89 to 96) among syndrome-negative controls. The effectiveness was 98% against ICU admission and 98% against Covid-19 resulting in the receipt of life support. All 7 deaths occurred in patients who were unvaccinated. CONCLUSIONS Among hospitalized adolescent patients, two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine were highly effective against Covid-19-related hospitalization and ICU admission or the receipt of life support.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1056/NEJMoa2117995     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15334406&id=doi:10.1056%2FNEJMoa2117995&atitle=Effectiveness+of+BNT162B2+Vaccine+against+Critical+Covid-19+in+Adolescents&stitle=New+Engl.+J.+Med.&title=New+England+Journal+of+Medicine&volume=386&issue=8&spage=713&epage=723&aulast=Olson&aufirst=Samantha+M.&auinit=S.M.&aufull=Olson+S.M.&coden=NEJMA&isbn=&pages=713-723&date=2022&auinit1=S&auinitm=M,hypertensive factor;tozinameran;adolescent;article;artificial ventilation;case control study;cause of death;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug efficacy;electronic medical record;extracorporeal oxygenation;female;hospital admission;hospitalization;human;intensive care unit;major clinical study;male;reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;bnt 162b2;Adolescent;Vaccination,,

Methods: Real-world ambulatory EHR vaccination data across three EHRs were linked using a unified patient key (UPK) and mined for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine type, manufacturer, series, and vaccination date thru October 31, 2021. To ensure vaccination series were consistently measured for a manufacturer, if the EHR data was not populated or if more than one series was captured for a UPK, then the series was calculated using the vaccination data and vaccination timing recommendations. Three vaccines were investigated Janssen (N=126,456), Moderna (N=803,843), and Pfizer (N=877,720) including records with well-defined manufacturers. COVID-19 positive was defined as having a positive diagnosis or positive COVID-19 antigen test result. Only COVID-19 positives that occurred after Vaccination Complete were investigated. Results: All three vaccines have a less than 1.05% breakthrough infection rate (Janssen 1.03%; Moderna 0.46%, and Pfizer 0.58%). The highest breakthrough infection rates are seen between 14 and 180 days. The rates of breakthrough infection are lower in those manufacturer vaccines that required two shots than those that only required one-shot. Conclusions: EHR data is generally comparable to other studies on vaccine breakthrough rates. The vaccines studied appear to be providing immunity from the current variants of COVID-19 at an acceptable rate. The two-vaccine series/mRNA vaccines may offer a higher-level of immunity than one-shot/conventional vaccines. In the fight against COVID-19 there does appear to be a point in which the currently available vaccines are becoming less effective. The breakthrough infection rates for manufacturers drop between 181 to 240 days. The drop is currently unaccounted for but may be due to vaccination boosters or currently not enough data to capture that cohort.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1016/j.jval.2022.04.1596     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15244733&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.jval.2022.04.1596&atitle=RWD72+SARS-COV-2+Vaccine+Breakthrough+Infection+Rates+Based+Data+from+3+EHRS&stitle=Value+Health&title=Value+in+Health&volume=25&issue=7&spage=S589&epage=&aulast=Overcash&aufirst=J.&auinit=J.&aufull=Overcash+J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S589-&date=2022&auinit1=J&auinitm=,antigen;RNA vaccine;SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;adult;breakthrough infection;conference abstract;coronavirus disease 2019;female;human;immunity;infection rate;low drug dose;major clinical study;male;revaccination;vaccination;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

A retrospective analysis was done using TriNetX, a multicenter database of ∼80 million deidentified records. Children (<18 years) who were vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine up to November 15th, 2021 were identified and split into AD and non-AD cohorts. A 1:1 matched propensity score analysis was conducted, adjusting for comorbidities and demographics, to generate adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% CI for safety and efficacy outcomes respectively. Safety outcomes included 1-day anaphylaxis and 60-day follow-up for all-cause hospitalization, and FDA-defined adverse events of special interest (AESI). Efficacy was measured as 60-day risk of breakthrough infection (BI). From the 73,984 children who received a COVID-19 vaccine, 6% had AD. A matched cohort of 4505 AD children revealed no differences in safety outcomes for 1 day anaphylaxis (aRR[95%CI]=1.03[0.4,2.4]), 60-day hospitalization (1.25[0.6,2.7]) and AESI (1.02[0.3,2.4]) between cohorts. Additionally AD children did not have a higher risk of BI (aHR[95%CI]=1.7[0.8,3.3]) compared to controls. The results show that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective for pediatric AD patients.

Parker, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London, United Kingdom","Background: Kidney disease is a key risk factor for COVID-19-related mortality and suboptimal vaccine response. Optimising vaccination strategies is essential to reduce the disease burden in this vulnerable population. Methods: With the approval of NHS England, we performed a retrospective cohort study to estimate the comparative effectiveness of schedules involving AZD1222 (AZ; ChAdOx1-S) and BNT162b2 (BNT) among people with kidney disease. Using linked primary care and UK Renal Registry records in the OpenSAFELY-TPP platform, we identified adults with stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease, dialysis recipients, and kidney transplant recipients. We used Cox proportional hazards models to compare COVID-19-related outcomes and non-COVID-19 death after two-dose (AZ–AZ vs BNT–BNT) and three-dose (AZ–AZ–BNT vs BNT–BNT–BNT) schedules. Findings: After two doses, incidence during the Delta wave was higher in AZ–AZ (n=257,580) than BNT–BNT recipients (n=169,205; adjusted hazard ratios [95% CIs] 1·43 [1·37–1·50], 1·59 [1·43–1·77], 1·44 [1·12–1·85], and 1·09 [1·02–1·17] for SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation, COVID-19-related death, and non-COVID-19 death, respectively). Findings were consistent across disease subgroups, including dialysis and transplant recipients. After three doses, there was little evidence of differences between AZ–AZ–BNT (n=220,330) and BNT–BNT–BNT recipients (n=157,065) for any outcome during a period of Omicron dominance. Interpretation: Among individuals with moderate-to-severe kidney disease, two doses of BNT conferred stronger protection than AZ against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease. A subsequent BNT dose levelled the playing field, emphasising the value of heterologous RNA doses in vulnerable populations.

Egli, Petersgraben 4, Basel, Switzerland","Introduction: COVID-19 vaccines significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 (SCoV2)-related hospitalization and mortality in randomized controlled clinical trials, as well as in real-world effectiveness against different circulating SCoV2-lineages. However, some vaccine recipients show breakthrough infection and it remains unknown, which host and viral factors contribute to this risk and how many resulted in severe outcomes. Our aim was to identify demographic and clinical risk factors for SCoV2 breakthrough infections and severe disease in fully vaccinated individuals and to compare patient characteristics in breakthrough infections caused by SCoV2 Alpha or Delta variant. Methods: We conducted an exploratory retrospective case-control study from 28th of December to 25th of October 2021 dominated by the Delta SCoV2 variant. All cases of infection had to be reported by law to the local health authorities. Vaccine recipients' data was anonymously available from the national Vaccination Monitoring Data Lake and the main local vaccine center. We compared anonymized patients' characteristics of breakthrough infection (n=492) to two overlapping control groups including all vaccine recipients from the Canton of Basel-City (group 1 n=126’586 and group 2 n=109’382). We also compared patients with breakthrough infection caused by the Alpha to Delta variant. We used different multivariate generalized linear models (GLM). Results: We found only 492/126’586 (0.39%) vaccine recipients with a breakthrough infection after vaccination during the 10 months observational period. Most cases were asymptomatic or mild (478/492 97.2%) and only very few required hospitalization (14/492, 2.8%). The time to a positive SCoV2 test shows that most breakthrough infections occurred between a few days to about 170 days after full vaccination, with a median of 78 days (interquartile range, IQR 47-124 days). Factors associated with a lower odds for breakthrough infection were: age (OR 0.987, 95%CI 0.983-0.992), previous COVID-19 infection prior to vaccination (OR 0.296, 95%CI 0.117-0.606), and (self-declared) serious side-effects from previous vaccines (OR 0.289, 95%CI 0.033-1.035). Factors associated with a higher odds for breakthrough infection were: vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (OR 1.459, 95%CI 1.238-1.612), chronic disease as vaccine indication (OR 2.109, 95%CI 1.692-2.620), and healthcare workers (OR 1.404, 95%CI 1.042-1.860). We did not observe a significantly increased risk for immunosuppressed patients (OR 1.248, 95% CI 0.806-1.849). Conclusions: Our study shows that breakthrough infections are rare and show mild illness, but that it occurs early after vaccination with more than 50% of cases within 70 to 80 days post-full vaccination. This clearly implies that boost vaccination should be much earlier initiated compared to the currently communicated 180-day threshold. This has important implications especially for risk groups associated with more frequent breakthrough infections such as healthcare workers, and people in high-risk care facilities. Due to changes in the epidemiological dynamic with new variants emerging, continuous monitoring of breakthrough infections is helpful to provide evidence on booster vaccines and patient groups at risk for potential complications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: case-control",10.1101/2021.12.23.21268324     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2021.12.23.21268324&atitle=SARS-CoV-2+vaccine+Alpha+and+Delta+variant+breakthrough+infections+are+rare+and+mild%2C+but+happen+relative+early+after+vaccination&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Peter&aufirst=Jelissa+Katharina&auinit=J.K.&aufull=Peter+J.K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2021&auinit1=J&auinitm=K,adult;case control study;chronic disease;clinical trial;complication;controlled study;COVID-19 testing;demography;female;health care personnel;high risk population;hospitalization;human;major clinical study;male;nonhuman;retrospective study;risk assessment;risk factor;SARS-CoV-2 Alpha;side effect;vaccination;SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;Vaccination,,

Hadlock, 401 Terry Ave N, Seattle, WA, United States","Background: COVID-19 infection in pregnant people has previously been shown to increase the risk for poor maternal-fetal outcomes. Despite this, there has been a lag in COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant people due to concerns over the potential effects of the vaccine on maternal-fetal outcomes. Here we examine the impact of COVID-19 vaccination and booster on maternal COVID-19 breakthrough infections and birth outcomes. Methods: This was a retrospective multicenter cohort study on the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on maternal-fetal outcomes for people that delivered (n=86,833) at Providence St. Joseph Health across Alaska, California, Montana, Oregon, New Mexico, Texas, and Washington from January 26, 2021 through July 11, 2022. Cohorts were defined by vaccination status at time of delivery: unvaccinated (n=48,492), unvaccinated propensity score matched (n=26,790), vaccinated (n=26,792; two doses of mRNA-1273 Moderna or BNT162b2 Pfizer-BioNTech), and/or boosted (n=7,616). The primary outcome was maternal COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 vaccination status at delivery, COVID-19 infection-related health care, preterm birth (PTB), stillbirth, very low birth weight (VLBW), and small for gestational age (SGA) were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Findings: Vaccinated pregnant people were significantly less likely to have a maternal COVID-19 infection than unvaccinated matched (p<0.0001) pregnant people. During a maternal COVID-19 infection, vaccinated pregnant people had similar rates of hospitalization (p=0.23), but lower rates of supplemental oxygen (p<0.05) or vasopressor (p<0.05) use than those in an unvaccinated matched cohort. Compared to an unvaccinated matched cohort, vaccinated people had significantly lower stillbirth rate (p<0.01) as well as no difference in rate of PTB (p=0.35), SGA (p=0.79), or rate of VLBW (>1,500 g; 0.31). Vaccinated people who were boosted had significantly lower rates of maternal COVID-19 infections (p<0.0001), COVID-19 related hospitalization (p<0.05), PTB (p<0.05), stillbirth (p<0.01), SGA (p<0.05), and VLBW (p<0.01), compared to vaccinated people that did not receive a third booster dose five months after completing the initial vaccination series. Interpretation: COVID-19 vaccination protects against adverse maternal-fetal outcomes with booster doses conferring additional protection against COVID-19 infection. It is therefore important for pregnant people to have high priority status for vaccination, and for them to stay current with their COVID-19 vaccination schedule.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.08.12.22278727     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.08.12.22278727&atitle=The+effect+of+COVID-19+vaccination+and+booster+on+maternal-fetal+outcomes%3A+a+retrospective+multicenter+cohort+study&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Piekos&aufirst=Samantha+N.&auinit=S.N.&aufull=Piekos+S.N.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=S&auinitm=N,adult;Alaska;breakthrough infection;California;cohort analysis;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;female;fetal health;fetus;fetus outcome;hospitalization;human;major clinical study;Montana;multicenter study;New Mexico;nonhuman;Oregon;outcome assessment;pregnancy;pregnancy outcome;prematurity;propensity score;retrospective study;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;small for gestational age;stillbirth;Texas;vaccination;very low birth weight;Washington;elasomeran;hypertensive factor;oxygen;tozinameran;Cohort Studies;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

This study aimed to assess the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination effectiveness, as assessed by reductions in incidence, symptom severity, and further infection spreading. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 9811 health workers operating at the Verona University Hospital, Italy, from 27 December 2020 to 3 May 2021. All health workers were offered vaccination with Comirnaty (BNT162b2, BioNTech/Pfizer, Mainz, Germany/New York, United States), and a health surveillance program was implemented with periodical swab testing. Vaccination status and clinical data were collected using an ad hoc semi-structured questionnaire and health surveillance charts. Results: As of 3rd of May, 82.5% of health workers had been vaccinated against SAR-CoV-2, and 177 (1.8%) had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination more than halved the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduced by two-thirds the cumulative incidence of symptomatic subjects. In detail, most unvaccinated HWs were symptomatic; 50% reported fever, 45% reported ageusia/anosmia, and nearly 20% reported dyspnea. These percentages were much lower in HWs who had been vaccinated for at least 14 days (18% for fever and anosmia, 6% for dyspnea and ageusia). Moreover, cases of vaccine breakthrough were sixfold less likely to further spread the infection than unvaccinated HWs. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination reduced the infection frequency among HWs, further spreading of the infection, and the presence, severity, and duration of COVID-19-related symptoms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.3390/vaccines10020272     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=2076393X&id=doi:10.3390%2Fvaccines10020272&atitle=Post-Vaccination+SARS-CoV-2+Infections+among+Health+Workers+at+the+University+Hospital+of+Verona%2C+Italy%3A+A+Retrospective+Cohort+Survey&stitle=Vaccines&title=Vaccines&volume=10&issue=2&spage=&epage=&aulast=Porru&aufirst=Stefano&auinit=S.&aufull=Porru+S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=S&auinitm=,tozinameran;polymerase chain reaction system;protective equipment;reverse transcriptase PCR assay kit;swab (sampler);adult;ageusia;allergy;anosmia;article;autoimmune disease;body weight;cardiovascular disease;cohort analysis;comparative effectiveness;coronavirus disease 2019;coughing;data analysis;diabetes mellitus;disease severity;disease transmission;dyspnea;female;fever;follow up;headache;health care personnel;health survey;heart arrhythmia;heart muscle ischemia;hematologic disease;hospitalization;human;hypertension;immunosuppressive treatment;infection;major clinical study;malaise;male;myalgia;neoplasm;neurologic disease;nonhuman;observational study;outcome assessment;pandemic;respiratory tract disease;retrospective study;reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction;rhinorrhea;sensitivity analysis;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;sore throat;structured questionnaire;swabbing;vaccination;virus transmission;bnt162b2;Vaccination;Italy;Vaccines,,

Methods We used national SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-19 mRNA vaccination data in England to estimate protection following previous infection and vaccination against symptomatic PCR-confirmed delta and omicron BA.1/BA.2 variants in 11-17-year-olds using a test-negative case-control design. Findings By 31 March 2022, 63.6% of 16-17-year-olds and 48.2% of 12-15-year-olds had received ≥1 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose. Between 08 August 2021 and 31 March 2022, 1,161,704 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-tests were successfully linked to COVID-19 vaccination status. In unvaccinated adolescents, prior infection with wildtype, alpha or delta provided greater protection against subsequent delta infection than subsequent omicron; prior omicron infection provided had the highest protection against omicron reinfection (59.3%; 95%CI: 46.7-69.0). In infection-naïve adolescents, vaccination provided lower protection against symptomatic omicron infection than delta, peaking at 64.5% (95%CI; 63.6-65.4) 2-14 days after dose two and 62.9% (95%CI; 60.5-65.1) 2-14 weeks after dose three, with rapidly waning protection after each dose. Previously infected and vaccinated adolescents had the highest protection, irrespective of primary infecting SARS-CoV-2 strain. The highest protection against omicron was observed in vaccinated adolescents with prior omicron infection, reaching 96.4% (95%CI, 84.4-99.1) at 15-24 weeks post dose two.

However, little is known about the long-term effectiveness in this age group. It is known, though, that waning of vaccine-induced immunity against infection in adult populations is evident within a few months. Methods: Leveraging the centralized computerized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), we conducted a matched case-control design for evaluating the association between time since vaccination and the incidence of infections, where two outcomes were evaluated separately: a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection (regardless of symptoms) and a symptomatic infection (COVID-19). Cases were defined as individuals aged 12 to 16 with a positive PCR test occurring between June 15 and December 8, 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant in Israel. Controls were adolescents who had not tested positive previously. Results: We estimated a peak vaccine effectiveness between 2 weeks and 3 months following receipt of the second dose, with 85% and 90% effectiveness against SARSCoV-2 infection and COVID-19, respectively. However, in line with previous findings for adults, waning of vaccine effectiveness was evident in adolescents as well. Long-term protection conferred by the vaccine was reduced to 75-78% against infection and symptomatic infection, respectively, 3 to 5 months after the second dose, and waned to 58% against infection and 65% against COVID-19 after 5 months.

Patients who completed a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine sequence or received an additional booster were identified up to November 15th 2021 and divided into two cohorts based on history of skin cancer. 1:1 propensity score matching was done, adjusting for comorbidities and demographics, to find adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% CI for safety and efficacy outcomes respectively. Safety outcomes included 1-day anaphylaxis, 60-day follow-up for hospitalization, and FDA-defined adverse events of special interest (AESI). Efficacy included 60-day risk of BI. Subgroup analysis was conducted for basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma patients. A matched cohort of 17,384 fully vaccinated skin cancer patients revealed no higher risk in 1-day anaphylaxis (aRR[95%CI]=1.01[0.4,2.6]) or 60 day hospitalization (0.98[0.7,1.3]) and AESI (1.2[0.9,1.8]). Skin cancer patients also were not at higher BI risk (1.61[0.9,2.8]). No differences were seen among subgroups compared to controls. In a matched cohort of 6,382 boosted skin cancer patients, similar findings were seen in overall skin cancer patients and subgroups with no higher risk in any assessed adverse events compared to controls. Overall, the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective for patients with a history of skin cancer, but further research is needed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1016/j.jid.2022.05.269     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15231747&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.jid.2022.05.269&atitle=262+Safety+and+efficacy+of+the+COVID-19+vaccine+among+fully+vaccinated+and+boosted+skin+cancer+patients&stitle=J.+Invest.+Dermatol.&title=Journal+of+Investigative+Dermatology&volume=142&issue=8&spage=S44&epage=&aulast=Raiker&aufirst=R.&auinit=R.&aufull=Raiker+R.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S44-&date=2022&auinit1=R&auinitm=,SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;adult;anaphylaxis;basal cell carcinoma;breakthrough infection;cancer patient;cohort analysis;comorbidity;conference abstract;controlled study;demographics;drug efficacy;drug safety;drug therapy;female;follow up;genetic susceptibility;hospitalization;human;human cell;infection risk;major clinical study;male;melanoma;multicenter study;outcome assessment;propensity score;retrospective study;risk assessment;skin cancer;squamous cell carcinoma;Skin Neoplasms;Vaccination,,

Design: Propensity-score matched retrospective Cohort Study. Setting: Large public university undergoing weekly Covid-19 testing in South Carolina, USA. Participants: Population consists of 24,145 university students and employees undergoing weekly Covid-19 testing between January 3rd and January 31st, 2022. The analytic sample was constructed via propensity score matching on vaccination status: Unvaccinated, completion of 2-dose mRNA series within previous 5 months, and receipt of mRNA booster dose within previous 5 months. The resulting analytic sample consists of 1,944 university students and 658 university employees. Intervention: Vaccination with a two dose or 3 dose regimen of the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine. Results: Booster protection against any SARS-CoV-2 infection was 66.4% among employees (95% CI: 46.1-79.0%; P<.001) and 45.4% among students (95% CI: 30.0-57.4%; P<.001). Compared to the 2-dose mRNA series, estimated increase in protection from the booster dose was 40.8% among employees (P=.024) and 37.7% among students (P=.001). We did not have enough evidence to conclude a statistically significant protective effect of the 2-dose mRNA vaccination series, nor did we have enough evidence to conclude that protection waned in the 5-month period after receipt of the 2nd or 3rd mRNA dose. Furthermore, we did not find evidence that protection varied by manufacturer. Conclusions: Covid-19 mRNA booster doses offer moderate protection against any SARS-CoV-2 infection caused by the omicron variant and provide a substantial increase in protection relative to the 2-dose mRNA vaccination series.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.05.06.22274771     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.05.06.22274771&atitle=Covid-19+vaccine+effectiveness+against+general+SARS-CoV-2+infection+from+the+omicron+variant%3A+A+retrospective+cohort+study&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Rennert&aufirst=Lior&auinit=L.&aufull=Rennert+L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=L&auinitm=,adult;cohort analysis;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;COVID-19 testing;drug dose regimen;drug therapy;employee;female;human;major clinical study;male;nonhuman;propensity score;retrospective study;SARS-CoV-2 Omicron;South Carolina;transcription initiation;university student;vaccination;elasomeran;messenger RNA;tozinameran;Cohort Studies;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

Novel SARS-CoV-2 (SCV2) variants may differ in epidemiology and clinical impact. PAIVED, a randomized trial comparing the efficacy of 3 different platforms of inactivated influenza vaccines in adult military health system beneficiaries, actively surveils participants for influenza-like illness (ILI), including COVID-19, and conducts targeted investigations among those who develop ILI. The current season (2021/22) offered an opportunity to assess symptomatology associated with emerging SCV2 variants in this prospective cohort. Methods. Following receipt of influenza vaccine, PAIVED participants receive a weekly email or text message querying for ILI symptoms. Those who reported ILI completed a validated symptom diary (FLU-PRO Plus) daily for 7 days and collected a nasal swab. Nasal specimens underwent multiplex PCR testing, followed by SCV2 genome sequencing as applicable. PAIVED study participants from the 2021-22 influenza season who reported an ILI, had confirmed infection with SCV2 for which sequence data is available, and completed at least one FLU-PRO Plus survey were included in this analysis. Results. To date, 293 participants (7% of active cohort; 22.5% reporting ILI) tested positive for SCV2; sequencing has identified 23 Delta and 200 Omicron variants (199 BA.1, 1 BA.2). Among the 212 participants with sequenced SCV2 and symptom data, 55% were male, 57% were white, and 85% were active-duty military (Table 1). Overall, peak symptom severity was classified as mild to moderate in 79.3% of cases, fever duration averaged 2.5±2.2 days, and there were activity limitations for a mean of 5.2±3.8 days. No differences in maximum symptom scores (total or by domain) were detected for participants infected with Omicron compared to Delta. Figure 1 depicts variation in mean symptom scores by day of ILI, grouped by variant Conclusion. Omicron emerged as the predominant SCV2 variant causing ILI in our cohort this season, typically manifesting with mild symptoms. Further exploration of potential differences in ILI experience between SCV2 variants and other ILI causes, plus the impact and timing of vaccination, will add insight into the relative contribution of such factors on symptomatology.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1093/ofid/ofac492.351     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=23288957&id=doi:10.1093%2Fofid%2Fofac492.351&atitle=Emergence+of+the+SARS-CoV-2+Omicron+Variant+in+the+Pragmatic+Assessment+of+Influenza+Vaccine+Effectiveness+in+the+Department+of+Defense+%28PAIVED%29+Study&stitle=Open+Forum+Infect.+Dis.&title=Open+Forum+Infectious+Diseases&volume=9&issue=&spage=S183&epage=S184&aulast=Richard&aufirst=Stephanie+A.&auinit=S.A.&aufull=Richard+S.A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S183-S184&date=2022&auinit1=S&auinitm=A,"influenza vaccine;adult;army;clinical trial;cohort analysis;conference abstract;controlled study;e-mail;female;fever;flu like syndrome;human;influenza;major clinical study;male;multiplex polymerase chain reaction;nonhuman;nose smear;potential difference;prospective study;SARS-CoV-2 Omicron;season;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;symptomatology;vaccination;Influenza, Human;Vaccination;Influenza Vaccines;Vaccines",,

Although CanSino is currently approved for use in 10 Latin American, Asian, and European countries, little information is available about its vaccine effectiveness (VE). Methods: We evaluated CanSino VE within a childcare worker cohort that included 1,408 childcare facilities. Participants were followed during March–December 2021 and tested through SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR or rapid antigen test if they developed any symptom compatible with COVID-19. Vaccination status was obtained through worker registries. VE was calculated as 100% × (1−hazard ratio for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated vs. unvaccinated participants), using an Andersen-Gill model adjusted for age, sex, state, and local viral circulation. Results: The cohort included 43,925 persons who were mostly (96%) female with a median age of 32 years; 37,646 (86%) were vaccinated with CanSino. During March–December 2021, 2,250 (5%) participants had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, of whom 25 were hospitalized and 6 died. Adjusted VE was 20% (95% CI = 10–29%) against illness, 76% (42–90%) against hospitalization, and 94% (66–99%) against death. VE against illness declined from 48% (95% CI = 33–61) after 14–60 days following full vaccination to 20% (95% CI = 9–31) after 61–120 days. Conclusions: CanSino vaccine was effective at preventing COVID-19 illness and highly effective at preventing hospitalization and death. It will be useful to further evaluate duration of protection and assess the value of booster doses to prevent COVID-19 and severe outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.04.14.22273413     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.04.14.22273413&atitle=Vaccine+effectiveness+of+CanSino+%28Adv5-nCoV%29+COVID-19+vaccine+among+childcare+workers+%E2%80%93+Mexico%2C+March%E2%80%93December+2021&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Richardson&aufirst=Vesta+L.&auinit=V.L.&aufull=Richardson+V.L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=V&auinitm=L,adult;child care;cohort analysis;comparative effectiveness;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;female;gill;hospitalization;human;major clinical study;male;Mexico;nonhuman;outcome assessment;prevention;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;worker;antigen;ad5 ncov;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

Objective: To evaluate the vaccine effectiveness (VE) over time and determine differences across demographic and clinical risk factors of COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This test negative design consisted of adult patients who were tested or diagnosed for COVID-19 at Michigan Medicine in 2021. Variables extracted from Electronic Health Records included vaccination status, age, gender, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, body mass index, residential-level socioeconomic characteristics, past COVID-19 infection, being immunosuppressed, and health care worker status. Exposure: The primary exposure was vaccination status and was categorized into fully vaccinated with and without booster, partially vaccinated, or unvaccinated. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were infection with COVID-19 (positive test or diagnosis) and having severe COVID-19, i.e., either being hospitalized or deceased. Based on these, VE was calculated by quarter, vaccine, and patient characteristics. Results: Of 170,487 COVID-19 positive adult patients, 78,002 (45.8%) were unvaccinated, and 92,485 (54.2%) were vaccinated, among which 74,060 (80.1%) were fully vaccinated. COVID-19 positivity and severity rates were substantially higher among unvaccinated (12.1% and 1.4%, respectively) compared to fully vaccinated individuals (4.7% and 0.4%, respectively). Among 7,187 individuals with a booster, only 18 (0.3%) had a severe outcome. The covariate-adjusted VE against an infection was 62.1% (95%CI 60.3-63.8%), being highest in the Q2 of 2021 (90.9% [89.5-92.1%]), lowest in Q3 (60.1% [55.9-64.0%]), and rebounding in Q4 to 68.8% [66.3-71.1%]). Similarly, VE against severe COVID-19 overall was 73.7% (69.6-77.3%) and remained high throughout 2021: 87.4% (58.1-96.3%), 92.2% (88.3-94.8%), 74.4% (64.8-81.5%) and 83.0% (78.8-86.4%), respectively. Data on fully vaccinated individuals from Q4 indicated additional protection against infection with an additional booster dose (VE-Susceptibility: 64.0% [61.1-66.7%] vs. 87.3% [85.0-89.2%]) and severe outcomes (VE-Severity: 78.8% [73.5-83.0%] vs. 94.0% [89.5-96.6%]). Comparisons between Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines indicated similar protection against susceptibility (82.9% [80.7-84.9%] versus 88.1% [85.5-90.2%]) and severity (87.1% [80.3-91.6%]) vs. (84.9% [76.2-90.5%]) after controlling for vaccination timing and other factors. There was no significant effect modification by all the factors we examined. Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccines offered high protection against infection and severe COVID-19, and showed decreasing effectiveness over time and improved protection with a booster.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1101/2022.01.29.22269971     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.01.29.22269971&atitle=Estimating+COVID-19+Vaccination+Effectiveness+Using+Electronic+Health+Records+of+an+Academic+Medical+Center+in+Michigan&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Roberts&aufirst=Emily+K.&auinit=E.K.&aufull=Roberts+E.K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=E&auinitm=K,adult;body mass;comorbidity;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;electronic health record;ethnicity;female;gender;health care personnel;human;major clinical study;male;Michigan;race;university hospital;vaccination;SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;Vaccination;Academic Medical Centers;Vaccines,,

OBJECTIVES: to present, using real data, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the booster dose in reducing severe disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in terms of COVID-19 hospitalization and intensive care admission, and all-cause mortality. DESIGN: descriptive study of vaccination uptake; associative study of the factors linked with uptake of vaccination and COVID-19 symptoms; associative study of vaccine effectiveness against hospital admission and mortality. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: population residing in the Milan and Lodi provinces (Lombardy Region, Northern Italy), eligible for anti-SARS-COV-2 vaccination, with subjects aged ≥19 years alive as at 01.10.2021, not residing in nursing homes, followed-up until 31.12.2021. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: COVID-19 symptoms, hospitalization, intensive care hospitalization, and all-cause mortality in the period 01.10.2021-31.12.2021. RESULTS: the cohort included 2,936,193 patients as of 01.10.2021; at the end of the observation period (31.12.2021), 378,616 (12.9%) were unvaccinated, 60,102 (2.0%) had received only 1 dose and had not had the disease, 68,777 (2.3%) had received only 1 dose and had had the disease, 412,227 (14.0%) were fully vaccinated with 2 doses less than 4 months earlier, 198,459 (6.8%) had received 2 doses [4,5) months earlier, 439,363 (15.0%) had received 2 doses [5,6) months earlier, 87,984 (3.0%) had received 2 doses [6,7) months earlier, 74,152 (2.5%) had received 2 doses more than 7 months earlier, 62,614 (2.1%) had received 2 doses and had had the disease, and, finally, 1,153,899 (39.3%) had received a booster shot. In the study period (01.10.2021-31.12.2021), characterized by a very high prevalence of the omicron variant, 121,620 cases (positive antigen/molecular test), 3,661 hospitalizations for COVID-19, 162 intensive care admissions for COVID-19, and 7,508 deaths from all causes were identified. Compared to unvaccinated subjects, subjects who received a booster had half the risk of being symptomatic, and had half the risk of experiencing fatigue, muscle aches, and dyspnoea. In comparison with boosted subjects, unvaccinated subjects had a 10-fold risk of hospitalization, a 9-fold risk of intensive care, and a 3-fold risk of dying. CONCLUSIONS: this work highlights the effectiveness of vaccination in reducing serious adverse events in boosted subjects and the need to implement specific policies of engagement to bring subjects who received their second dose earliest to get a booster.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.19191/EP22.1-2.A001.001     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=23851937&id=doi:10.19191%2FEP22.1-2.A001.001&atitle=Boosters+and+time+since+last+anti-COVID-19+vaccine+dose%3A+lead+public+health+choices+by+real-time+epidemiological+assessment&stitle=Epidemiol.+Preven.&title=Epidemiologia+e+Prevenzione&volume=46&issue=1-2&spage=34&epage=46&aulast=Russo&aufirst=Antonio+Giampiero&auinit=A.G.&aufull=Russo+A.G.&coden=&isbn=&pages=34-46&date=2022&auinit1=A&auinitm=G,SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;adult;all cause mortality;article;cause of death;cohort analysis;comorbidity;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;disease course;dying;female;follow up;hospital admission;hospital discharge;hospitalization;human;intensive care unit;major clinical study;male;nonhuman;population research;prevalence;public health;risk factor;SARS-CoV-2 Omicron;vaccination;Vaccination,,

The aim of this study is to describe the effect of vaccination in term of mortality, type of ventilation and ICU admission among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from May to December 2021 in a Ligurian Hospital. Methods. This is a retrospective, single-center study conducted in San Martino Hospital (Genoa, Italy), including patients ≥ 18 years hospitalized for COVID-19 in Infectious Disease and Emergency Units from 1st May to 31st December 2021. We collected demographical data, multimorbidity and disability score, vaccination time (“vaccinated” all patients hospitalized ≥ 14 days after first dose or ≥ 7 days after second/ third dose), therapy for COVID-19, mortality at 7 and 30 days, ICU admission, ventilation type. Characteristics of vaccinated (group A) versus non vaccinated (group B) patients were compared using Chi-squared/Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and t-test /Kruskal-Wallis test for the continuous ones. Cox proportional hazards models for death at 30 days were performed as univariate analysis as well as adjusting for age, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale [CIRS], gender, Remdesivir, Monoclonal antibodies, Tocilizumab use. Results. Overall, 405 patients SARS-CoV-2 infected were enrolled. Data about timing of vaccination were available for 360 patients (89%). We compared clinical characteristics and outcomes of group A (32%) versus group B (68%). In group A patients were older (p< 0.001) and frailer (higher CIRS score and lower Barthel index, p< 0.001) than in group B. Among patients requiring oxygen, 76 (31.5%) in group B vs 26 (22.41%) in group A needed high flow ventilation (p=0.036); 33 (13.52%) vs 3 (2.59%) respectively were admitted to ICU (Figure 1). Mortality at 30 days after hospitalization was higher in group A at univariate analysis [HR(95%CI) 1.44(0.82; 2.53), p=0.208], lower at multivariate analysis [0.57(0.31; 1.02), p=0.059]. Conclusion. The results of this study confirm that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination reduces rate of admission to ICU and 30 days mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19. In our cohort mortality among vaccinated patients remains high and we hypothesized this is due to high frailty of evaluated population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1093/ofid/ofac492.1569     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=23288957&id=doi:10.1093%2Fofid%2Fofac492.1569&atitle=Effect+of+SARS-CoV-2+Vaccination+in+a+Frailty+COVID-19+Cohort%3A+a+Real+Life+Experience+in+a+Northern+Italy+Hospital&stitle=Open+Forum+Infect.+Dis.&title=Open+Forum+Infectious+Diseases&volume=9&issue=&spage=S767&epage=&aulast=Russo&aufirst=Chiara&auinit=C.&aufull=Russo+C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S767-&date=2022&auinit1=C&auinitm=,oxygen;remdesivir;tocilizumab;adult;artificial ventilation;Barthel index;clinical feature;cohort analysis;communicable disease;conference abstract;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;Cumulative Illness Rating Scale;disability;emergency ward;female;frailty;gender;hospitalization;human;Italy;Kruskal Wallis test;major clinical study;male;mortality;multiple chronic conditions;nonhuman;outcome assessment;personal experience;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;univariate analysis;vaccination;vaccinee;Vaccination;Life Change Events,,

A retrospective cohort study was conducted among 1,139,458 residents of the province of Córdoba. Multiple logistic regression models were developed to describe the relationship between vaccination and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 or death from COVID-19, while taking account of comorbidities and chronic disease risk factors and adjusting for sex and age. Results. Among the general population, having received one or two doses of vaccine reduced the risk of illness by 98.8% and 99.3%, respectively, and the risk of dying by 83% and 96.5%, respectively. Among those who developed COVID-19, the probability of dying was reduced by 57% and 80%, respectively. Regarding probability of death, risk increased with age, with being male, and with obesity, arterial hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Conclusion. Vaccination is effective and protects against the risk of getting COVID-19, developing severe disease, or dying.

The impact of vaccination was not evaluated prior to the implementation of this strategy worldwide in this kind of population. It was proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of immunization during the second phase of our investigation. Methods: Cohort study derived from the National Registry of Patients with Cancer and COVID-19 (ACHOCC-19). Data were collected from June 2021 since vaccine was available. Patients were: older than 18 years, diagnosed with cancer (solid tumors), treated and/or under follow-up, and with COVID-19 infection. The comparative analysis of the vaccinated and non-vaccinated cohort is presented. Outcomes included: all-cause mortality within 30 days of infection diagnosis, hospitalization, and mechanical ventilation. Effect estimation was performed through relative risk (RR) and multivariate analysis for each event, using generalized linear models of the binomial family. Results: 896 patients were included, 470 were older than 60 years (52.4%) and 59% women (n = 530). 172 patients were recruited in the vaccinated cohort and 724 in the non-vaccinated cohort (ratio: 1 to 4.2). The cumulative incidence of hospitalization among the unvaccinated was 42.4% (n = 307), and among the vaccinated, 29% (n = 50); invasive mechanical ventilation requirement was 8.4% (n = 61) in unvaccinated, and 4.6% (n = 8) in vaccinated. The cumulative incidence of mortality from all causes in the unvaccinated was 17% (n = 123) and in the vaccinated 4.65% (n = 8). Table summarizes the multivariate analysis. The adjusted RR for mortality for the unvaccinated is 3.4 (95% CI: 1.7-6.8), for hospitalization 1.36 (95% CI: 1.08-1.72), and for mechanical ventilation 2.1 (95% CI: 1.02-4.2). Conclusions: The incidence of complications and death in patients with cancer and COVID-19 infection is significantly higher in those who have not received a vaccination schedule compared to those who have been vaccinated. Immunization should be promoted and intensified in this population group.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.e18721     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15277755&id=doi:10.1200%2FJCO.2022.40.16_suppl.e18721&atitle=Effectiveness+of+COVID+-19+vaccine+on+cancer+patients+in+one+Latin+American+country%3A+A+follow-up+of+ACHOC-C19+study&stitle=J.+Clin.+Oncol.&title=Journal+of+Clinical+Oncology&volume=40&issue=16&spage=&epage=&aulast=Serrano&aufirst=Aylen+Vanessa+Ospina&auinit=A.V.O.&aufull=Serrano+A.V.O.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=A&auinitm=V.O.,SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;adult;all cause mortality;artificial ventilation;cancer patient;cohort analysis;comparative effectiveness;complication;conference abstract;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;cumulative incidence;drug therapy;female;follow up;hospitalization;human;immunization;incidence;invasive ventilation;major clinical study;male;mortality;population group;risk assessment;risk factor;solid malignant neoplasm;vaccination;Cancer Vaccines;Vaccination,,

Simmons, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"", ""D.N. Fisman, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada""]","Background: Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to reduce risk of infection, as well as severe disease among those with breakthrough infection, in adults. The latter effect is particularly important as Immune evasion by Omicron variants appears to have made vaccines less effective for prevention of infection. There is currently little available information on the protection conferred by vaccination against severe illness due to SARS-CoV-2 in children. Methods: To minimize confounding by changing vaccination practices and dominant circulating viral variants, we performed an age- and time-matched nested case-control design. Reported SARS-CoV-2 case records in Ontario children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 were linked to vaccination records. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the effectiveness of one and two vaccine doses against hospitalization. Results: We identified 130 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 cases and 1,300 non-hospitalized, age- and time-matched controls, with disease onset between May 28, 2021 and January 9, 2022. One vaccine dose was shown to be 34% effective against hospitalization among SARS-CoV-2 cases (aOR = 0.66 [95% CI: 0.34, 1.21]). In contrast, two doses were 56% (aOR = 0.44 [95% CI: 0.23, 0.83]) effective at preventing hospitalization among SARS-CoV-2 cases. Exploratory instrumental variable analyses, and calculation of E-values, suggested that these effects are unlikely to be explained by unmeasured confounding. Conclusions: Even with immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2 variants, two vaccine doses continue to provide protection against hospitalization among adolescent and pediatric SARS-CoV-2 cases, even when the vaccines do not prevent infection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: case-control",10.1101/2022.03.24.22272919     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.03.24.22272919&atitle=Vaccine+Effectiveness+Against+Hospitalization+Among+Adolescent+and+Pediatric+SARS-CoV-2+Cases+in+Ontario%2C+Canada&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Simmons&aufirst=Alison+E.&auinit=A.E.&aufull=Simmons+A.E.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=A&auinitm=E,adolescent;Canada;child;comparative effectiveness;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;female;hospitalization;human;immune evasion;instrumental variable analysis;major clinical study;male;nonhuman;Ontario;pediatric patient;prevention;quantitative analysis;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;variant of concern;RNA vaccine;SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;Vaccination;Adolescent;Vaccines,,

BNT162b2 showed lower levels of neutralizing antibodies against Beta than against other strains raising concerns about effectiveness of vaccines against infections caused by Beta. We estimated BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against Beta infections in Israel, a country with high vaccine uptake. Methods: The Ministry of Health (MoH) identified Beta cases through mandatory reporting of SARS-CoV-2 cases and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of specimens from vaccination-breakthrough infections, reinfections, arriving international travelers, and a selection of other infected persons. A cohort analysis was conducted of exposure events of contacts of primary Beta cases. WGS was conducted on available PCR-positive specimens collected from contacts. VE estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) against confirmed and probable Beta infections were determined by comparing infection risk between unvaccinated and fully-vaccinated (≥7 days after the second dose) contacts, and between unvaccinated and partially-vaccinated (<7 days after the second dose) contacts. Findings: MoH identified 310 Beta cases through Jun 27, 2021. During the study period (Dec 11, 2020 – Mar 25, 2021), 164 non-institutionalized primary Beta cases, with 552 contacts aged ≥16 years, were identified. 343/552 (62%) contacts were interviewed and tested. 71/343 (21%) contacts were PCR-positive. WGS was performed on 7/71 (10%) PCR-positive specimens; all were Beta. Among SARS-CoV-2-infected contacts, 48/71 (68%) were symptomatic, 10/71 (14%) hospitalized, and 2/71 (3%) died. Fully-vaccinated VE against confirmed or probable Beta infections was 72% (95% CI -5 – 97%; p=0·04) and against symptomatic confirmed or probable Beta infections was 100% (95% CI 19 – 100%; p=0·01). There was no evidence of protection in partially-vaccinated contacts. Interpretation: In a prospective observational study, two doses of BNT162b2 were effective against confirmed and probable Beta infections. Through the end of June 2021, introductions of Beta did not interrupt control of the pandemic in Israel.

Vaccine status is included as a time-varying covariate and all models were adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, county of residence, country of birth, and living conditions. Data from the entire adult Norwegian population were collated from the National Preparedness Register for COVID-19 (Beredt C19). Results: The overall adjusted vaccine effectiveness against infection decreased from 81.3% (confidence interval (CI): 80.7 to 81.9) in the first two to nine weeks after receiving a second dose to 8.6% (CI:4.0 to 13.1) after more than 33 weeks, compared to 98.6% (CI: 97.5 to 99.2) and 66.6% (CI: 57.9 to 73.6) against hospitalisation respectively. After the third dose (booster), the effectiveness was 75.9% (CI: 73.4 to 78.1) against infection and 95.0% (CI: 92.6 to 96.6) against hospitalisation. Spikevax or a combination of mRNA products provided the highest protection, but the vaccine effectiveness decreased with time since vaccination for all vaccine regimens. Conclusions: Even though the vaccine effectiveness against infection wanes over time, all vaccine regimens remained effective against hospitalisation after the second vaccine dose. For all vaccine regimens, a booster facilitated recovery of effectiveness. The results from this support the use of heterologous schedules, increasing flexibility in vaccination policy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.03.29.22273086     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.03.29.22273086&atitle=Age+and+product+dependent+vaccine+effectiveness+against+SARS-CoV-2+infection+and+hospitalisation+among+adults+in+Norway%3A+a+national+cohort+study%2C+July+%E2%80%93+November+2021.&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Starrfelt&aufirst=Jostein&auinit=J.&aufull=Starrfelt+J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=J&auinitm=,adult;cohort analysis;comorbidity;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;female;groups by age;hospitalization;human;intensive care;intensive care unit;male;mortality;nonhuman;Norway;Norwegian (people);SARS-CoV-2 Delta;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;elasomeran;messenger RNA;Cohort Studies;Vaccination,,

However, few studies estimate population level vaccine effectiveness against multiple COVID-19 outcomes, by age and including homologous and heterologous vaccine regimens. Methods: Using Cox proportional hazard models on data from 4 293 544 individuals (99% of Norwegian adults), we estimated overall, age-, and product-specific vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisation, ICU admission and death in Norway, using data from national registries. Vaccine status was included as time-dependent variable and we adjusted for sex, pre-existing medical conditions, country of birth, county of residence, and crowded living conditions. Findings: Adjusted vaccine effectiveness among fully vaccinated is 72·1% (71·2‒73·0) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 92·9% (91·2‒94·2) against hospitalisation, 95·5% (92·6‒97·2) against ICU admission, and 88·0% (82·5‒91·8) against death. Among partially vaccinated, the effectiveness is 24·3% (22·3‒26·2) against infection and 82·7% (77·7‒86·6) against hospitalisation. Vaccine effectiveness against infection is 84·7% (83·1-86·1) for heterologous mRNA vaccine regimens, 78·3% (76·8-79·7) for Spikevax (Moderna; mRNA-1273), 69·7% (68·6-70·8) for Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech; BNT162b2), and 60·7% (57·5-63·6) for Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca; ChAdOx nCoV-19; AZD1222) with a mRNA dose among fully vaccinated. Interpretation: We demonstrate good protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease in fully vaccinated, including heterologous vaccine regimens, which could facilitate rapid immunization. Partially vaccinated were less likely to get severe disease than unvaccinated, though protection against infection was not as high, which could be essential in making vaccine prioritisation policies especially when availability is limited.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2021.11.12.21266222     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2021.11.12.21266222&atitle=Age+and+product+dependent+vaccine+effectiveness+against+SARS-CoV-2+infection+and+hospitalisation+among+adults+in+Norway%3A+A+national+cohort+study%2C+January+%E2%80%93+September+2021&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Starrfelt&aufirst=Jostein&auinit=J.&aufull=Starrfelt+J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2021&auinit1=J&auinitm=,adult;cohort analysis;controlled study;dependent variable;drug therapy;female;hospitalization;human;immunization;major clinical study;male;nonhuman;Norway;Norwegian (people);Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;tozinameran;elasomeran;messenger RNA;vaxzevria;Cohort Studies;Vaccination,,

Methods: Using patient-level data from 50 sites in the U.S. National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), we estimated COVID-19 booster vaccine effectiveness compared to full vaccination alone (completed 2 doses mRNA or 1 dose Janssen vaccine). At each month following full vaccination, we created comparable cohorts of patients with boosters propensity-score matched to those without boosters by age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, geographic region, prior COVID-19 infection, and calendar month of full vaccination. Booster efficacy was evaluated among patients with and without immunosuppressed/compromised conditions (ISC; HIV infection, solid organ or bone marrow transplant, autoimmune diseases, and cancer). We used Cox regression models to estimate hazards of breakthrough infection (COVID-19 diagnosis after last dose of vaccine) and logistic regression models to compare the risk of death ≤45 days after a breakthrough infection in the boosted vs. matched non-boosted groups. Results: By 11/18/2021, 656390 patients had received full vaccination, and 125409 fully vaccinated had received an additional booster (median time from last vaccine to booster dose: 7.4 months, IQR:6.6, 8.2). At completion of full vaccination, median age was 50 (IQR 33-64) years, 43% male, 50% white, 11% Black, 18% Latinx, 4.8% Asian American/Pacific Islander, and 20% had ISC. People receiving a booster were more likely to be older, male, white, and have ISC. Booster vaccine was significantly associated with a reduced hazard of breakthrough infection (Table). Booster efficacy ranged from 46% (booster receipt 1-4 months after full vaccination) to 83% (receipt 7 months after full vaccination) in people without ISC. Vaccine efficacy was lower, ranging from 43%-65%, in ISC patients (Table). Compared to fully vaccinated patients without booster receipt, patients with booster had an 83% (OR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.28) reduced risk of COVID-19 related death, independent of demographics, geographic region, comorbidities, ISC, prior COVID-19 infection, and time of full vaccination. Conclusion: A booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine has high effectiveness in reducing breakthrough infection risk among all fully vaccinated individuals, though only with moderate effectiveness among ISC patients. Nonetheless, booster vaccination significantly reduced risk for COVID-19 related death regardless of ISC status.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",,ibacovavec;messenger RNA;adult;Asian American;autoimmune disease;bone marrow transplantation;breakthrough infection;cancer patient;clinical evaluation;cohort analysis;comorbidity;comparative effectiveness;conference abstract;coronavirus disease 2019;demographics;drug therapy;ethnicity;female;Hispanic;human;Human immunodeficiency virus infection;immunopathology;infection risk;low drug dose;major clinical study;male;malignant neoplasm;middle aged;mortality;Pacific Islander;propensity score;race;revaccination;vaccination;vaccinee;Vaccines;Vaccination,,

Data support the effectiveness of boosters in preventing severe disease and hospitalization; however, the real-world impact on reducing incident SARS-CoV-2 infections across specific variants is not yet clear. Objectives: Assess the impact of COVID-19 boosters on protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a real-world setting from a highly vaccinated (99%) population curated from a linked database with test results, vaccination history, patient demographics, and genomic sequencing information from the National Basketball Association (NBA). Methods: In this population, 1,613 fully vaccinated staff and players (median age 34.5 years, 88% male) who tested at least once between 1 December 2021 and 5 January 2022, were analyzed. Individuals were tested at the time of reporting any symptom, regardless of severity, after known exposure per self-report or contact tracing and/or during enhanced surveillance. Boosted individuals (n=1260) were compared to fully vaccinated and booster eligible individuals (n=162), defined as 2 months post-JNJ-78436735 or 5-months post-second dose of mRNA vaccine. Individuals not yet eligible for a booster and those who recovered from COVID-19 between 1 November and 30 November, 2021 (n=25) were examined in secondary analyses but excluded from the primary comparison. Individuals who were not fully vaccinated (n=27) or who received a booster within 14 days during or prior to the observation period (n=916) were excluded. Results: In this closely monitored population, fully vaccinated booster-eligible individuals were 2.6 times more likely (RR = 2.6, 95% CI: 2.2 to 3.0, p<0.0001) to have a confirmed COVID-19 infection than boosted individuals. Secondary analysis including non-boosted individuals with recent vaccination or recent SARSCoV-2 infection found that non-boosted individuals were at greater risk of infection compared with boosted individuals (RR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.8 to 2.4, p<0.001). Results were similar when stratified by primary vaccination type with overlapping confidence intervals. No hospitalizations or deaths were observed in this cohort. Genetic sequencing confirmed 93% of infections to be Omicron (among n=330 sequenced). Conclusions: These results highlight the protective benefit of boosters against incident SARS-CoV-19 infection, not only for severe symptoms and death. Assessment of booster effectiveness remains vital for COVID-19 vaccines as new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge, as there is still uncertainty around performance in real-world settings. These data are needed to convince the general public that boosters remain effective at preventing in the spread of COVID-19.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.02.24.22271347     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.02.24.22271347&atitle=Booster+protection+against+Omicron+infection+in+a+highly+vaccinated+cohort&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Tai&aufirst=Caroline+G.&auinit=C.G.&aufull=Tai+C.G.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=C&auinitm=G,adult;contact examination;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;female;hospitalization;human;major clinical study;male;nonhuman;prevention;SARS coronavirus;secondary analysis;self report;sequence analysis;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;uncertainty;vaccination;vaccinee;ibacovavec;RNA vaccine;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

Tang, Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Miami VA Healthcare System, Miami, FL, United States","Background: Studies have shown that COVID-19 vaccination is effective at preventing infection and death in older populations. However, whether vaccination effectiveness is reduced in patients with frailty is unclear. We aimed to compare vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation and death after COVID-19 during the surge of the delta (B.1.617.2) variant of SARS-CoV-2 according to patients' frailty status. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we used data derived from the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities and the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) COVID-19 Shared Data Resource, which contains information from the VA National Surveillance Tool, death certificates, and National Cemetery Administration. We included veterans aged 19 years or older who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR or antigen tests between July 25 and Sept 30, 2021, with no record of a previous positive test. Deaths were identified through VHA facilities, death certificates, and National Cemetery Administration data available from VA databases. We also retrieved data including sociodemographic characteristics, medical conditions diagnosed at baseline, frailty score, and vaccination information. The primary outcomes were COVID-19-associated hospitalisations and all-cause deaths at 30 days from testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. The odds ratio (OR) for COVID-19-associated hospitalisation and hazard ratio (HR) for death of vaccinated patients compared with the unvaccinated patients were estimated according to frailty categories of robust, pre-frail, or frail. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as 1 minus the OR for COVID-19-associated hospitalisation, and 1 minus the HR for death. Findings: We identified 57 784 veterans (mean age 57·5 years [SD 16·7], 50 642 [87·6%] males, and 40 743 [70·5%] White people), of whom 28 497 (49·3%) were categorised as robust, 16 737 (29·0%) as pre-frail, and 12 550 (21·7%) as frail. There were 2577 all-cause deaths (676 [26·2%] in the vaccinated group and 1901 [73·8%] in the unvaccinated group), and 7857 COVID-19-associated hospitalisations (2749 [35·0%] in the vaccinated group and 5108 [65·0%] in the unvaccinated group) within 30 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-associated hospitalisation within 30 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was 65% (95% CI 61–69) in the robust group, 54% (48–58) in the pre-frail group, and 36% (30–42) in the frail group. By 30 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, the vaccine effectiveness for all-cause death was 79% (95% CI 74–84) in the robust group, 79% (75–83) in the pre-frail group, and 68% (63–71) in the frail group. Interpretation: Compared with non-frail patients (pre-frail and robust), those with frailty had lower levels of vaccination protection against COVID-19-associated hospitalisation and all-cause death. Future studies investigating COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness should incorporate frailty assessments and actively recruit older adults with frailty.

Tang, University of Miami, School of Medicine, Miami, FL, United States","Background: The COVID-19 delta variant became the predominant strain in the USA during the summer of 2021, contributing to increased breakthrough of COVID-19 cases. Despite reduced VE against symptomatic infections due to the delta variant, vaccines are still highly effective against severe COVID-19 infections. Research evidence suggests that frailty, a common condition in older adults may hinder vaccines effectiveness. Frailty represents a state of vulnerability to stressors characterized by chronic, low-grade, inflammation associated with multisystemic dysfunction leading to poor clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare the VE against COVID-19 associated hospitalization and death in older Veterans. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study including US Veterans who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from July 25th to September 15th, 2021. Frailty was operationalized with a 31-item VA Frailty Index (VA-FI) generated based on the number of EHR variables (morbidity, sensory loss, cognition/mood, etc). The VA-FI categorized Veterans into robust (FI<0.10), pre-frail (FI 0.10-0.21), and Frail (FI ≥0.21). After adjusting for age, BMI, race, ethnicity, gender, COPD, CVD, CKD, VE was assessed for robust, pre-frail, and Frail Veterans by logistic regression: COVID-19 related hospitalization or death as dependent variables, and vaccination status as the independent variable. Results: 36749 Veterans were included, 3725 (37.3%) of whom were fully vaccinated at the time of COVID-19 infection, mean age 56.6(SD=16.6), 87.7% (n= 32219) male, 68.3% (n=25,084) Caucasian, 84.6% (n=31,075), non-Hispanic, 49.5% (n=18,173) robust, 27.2% (n=9,988) pre-frail, and 23.4% (n=8,588) frail. Being vaccinated was associated with a 65% reduction in the odds of being hospitalized in the robust (OR=0.35, 95% CI: 0.31-0.40), whereas 31% had a reduction in the frail (OR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.63-0.76). Similarly, vaccination was associated with a 65% reduction in the odds of death in the robust (OR=0.35, 95% CI: 0.31-0.40), compared with a 31% reduction in the frail (OR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.63-0.76). Conclusions: This study shows reduced vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 severe outcomes in patients with frailty. Future studies should investigate strategies to increase the immunogenicity of COVID 19 vaccines in older adults with frailty.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1111/jgs.17755     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15315487&id=doi:10.1111%2Fjgs.17755&atitle=Reduced+Vaccine+Effectiveness+%28VE%29+against+Hospitalization+and+Death+in+Patients+with+Frailty+after+COVID-19+Infection+During+the+Delta+Surge&stitle=Epidemiology&title=Epidemiology&volume=70&issue=SUPPL+1&spage=S123&epage=S124&aulast=Tang&aufirst=F.&auinit=F.&aufull=Tang+F.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S123-S124&date=2022&auinit1=F&auinitm=,SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;adult;aged;body mass;Caucasian;chronic low grade inflammation;chronic obstructive lung disease;clinical outcome;cognition;cohort analysis;comparative effectiveness;conference abstract;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;dependent variable;drug therapy;ethnicity;female;frailty;gender;hospitalization;human;immunogenicity;independent variable;major clinical study;male;middle aged;mood;morbidity;nonhuman;outcome assessment;retrospective study;sensory dysfunction;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;veteran;vulnerability;Vaccination,,

Taquet, Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom","Vaccination has proven effective against infection with SARS-CoV-2, as well as death and hospitalisation following COVID-19 illness. However, little is known about the effect of vaccination on other acute and post-acute outcomes of COVID-19. Data were obtained from the TriNetX electronic health records network (over 81 million patients mostly in the USA). Using a retrospective cohort study and time-to-event analysis, we compared the incidences of COVID-19 outcomes between individuals who received a COVID-19 vaccine (approved for use in the USA) at least 2 weeks before SARS-CoV-2 infection and propensity score-matched individuals unvaccinated for COVID-19 but who had received an influenza vaccine. Outcomes were ICD-10 codes representing documented COVID-19 sequelae in the 6 months after a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (recorded between January 1 and August 31, 2021). Associations with the number of vaccine doses (1 vs. 2) and age (< 60 vs. ≥ 60 years-old) were assessed. Among 10,024 vaccinated individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 9479 were matched to unvaccinated controls. Receiving at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose was associated with a significantly lower risk of respiratory failure, ICU admission, intubation/ventilation, hypoxaemia, oxygen requirement, hypercoagulopathy/venous thromboembolism, seizures, psychotic disorder, and hair loss (each as composite endpoints with death to account for competing risks; HR 0.70-0.83, Bonferroni-corrected p<.05), but not other outcomes, including long-COVID features, renal disease, mood, anxiety, and sleep disorders. Receiving 2 vaccine doses was associated with lower risks for most outcomes. Associations between prior vaccination and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection were marked in those < 60 years-old, whereas no robust associations were observed in those ≥ 60 years-old. In summary, COVID-19 vaccination is associated with lower risk of several, but not all, COVID-19 sequelae in those with breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. These benefits of vaccination were clear in younger people but not in the over-60s. The findings may inform service planning, contribute to forecasting public health impacts of vaccination programmes, and highlight the need to identify additional interventions for COVID-19 sequelae.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2021.10.26.21265508     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2021.10.26.21265508&atitle=Six-month+sequelae+of+post-vaccination+SARS-CoV-2+infection%3A+a+retrospective+cohort+study+of+10%2C024+breakthrough+infections&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Taquet&aufirst=Maxime&auinit=M.&aufull=Taquet+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2021&auinit1=M&auinitm=,adult;anxiety disorder;artificial ventilation;cohort analysis;complication;controlled study;drug therapy;female;forecasting;hair loss;human;hypoxemia;ICD-10;incidence;intubation;kidney disease;long COVID;low drug dose;major clinical study;male;mood disorder;propensity score;psychosis;public health;respiratory failure;retrospective study;seizure;sleep disorder;vaccination;venous thromboembolism;influenza vaccine;oxygen;SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;Cohort Studies;Vaccination,,

Since then it has become a pandemic and poses a huge threat to global health. In order to curb this, the Malaysian government has implemented the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme since February 2021, prioritising high risk individuals including the end stage kidney disease (ESKD). However, the efficacy of Covid-19-vaccination in this population has limited evidence. Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of Covid-19-vaccination amongst ESKD. Methods: This is a single centre prospective observational study, reviewing data of adult ESKD patients with covid-19 infection admitted to nephrology ward in Hospital Selayang, Malaysia from 15thJuly 2021 till 14thAugust 2021. Demographic and clinical information were extracted from electronic medical records. Disease severity is classified as mild disease ( category 1-3) and severe disease ( category 4-5). Clinical outcome is defined as alive or death upon discharge. NHS Covid-19 Decision Support Tool score (NHS Score) developed to assist triaging and resource allocation based on age, gender, frailty scale and comorbidities; score of more than 8 is associated with poor prognosis. Clinical frailty scale of 1 to 3 is classified as fit and more than 3 as frail. Multiple logistics regression was performed to identify the odds of full vaccination in disease severity and in-hospital mortality. Data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistic version 26 with p<0.05 considered as significant. Results: A total of 95 patients were identified, with mean age of 57 ± 12.5 years and 68.4% of them are fit (1-3) based on clinical frailty scale. Majority on haemodialysis as renal replacement therapy (RRT) (n=88, 92.6%), predominated by male (n=56, 58.9%) and 60% were Malay (n=57). For vaccination status, 36.8% (n=35) of this cohort completed 2 doses of vaccination, 28.4% (n=27) received 1stdose and 34.7%(n=33) were vaccination-naïve. Upon admission, 65.3%(n=62) were in severe disease and 36.8% (n=35) has NHS Score of more than 8. None of the severe disease received immunomodulator. Full vaccination status was found to be significantly associated with mitigation of severe Covid-19 disease after adjusting for possible confounding factors (adjusted Odds ratio [aOR] 0.167, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.066-0.421), equivalent to vaccine effectiveness of 83.3%. Age, gender, ethnicity, clinical frailty scale, mode of RRT and NHS score are not significantly associated with disease severity. In-ward mortality was significantly associated with Covid-19 disease severity (aOR 0.107, CI 0.028-0.408) with p=0.001 and vaccination status (aOR 0.209, CI 0.066-0.668) with p=0.008. Full vaccination had reduced risk of death by 79%. ESKD with mild disease had a lower risk of death by 89% compared with those with severe disease. Age, frailty score, NHS score, ethnicity, mode of RRT and gender are not significantly associated with mortality.

Patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis are at a higher risk of infection and mortality than the general population. Worldwide, a vaccination campaign has been developed that has been shown to reduce severe infections and deaths in the general population. However, there are currently limited data on the clinical efficacy of vaccinations in the hemodialysis population. Methods: A national multicenter observational cohort was performed in Chile to evaluate the clinical efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in end-stage renal disease patients on chronic hemodialysis from February 2021 to August 2021. In addition, the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and CoronaVac (Sinovac) vaccines were evaluated. The efficacy of vaccination in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalizations, and deaths associated with COVID-19 was determined. Results: A total of 12,301 patients were evaluated; 10,615 (86.3%) received a complete vaccination (2 doses), 490 (4.0%) received incomplete vaccination, and 1196 (9.7%) were not vaccinated. During follow-up, 1362 (11.0%) patients developed COVID-19, and 150 died (case fatality rate: 11.0%). The efficacy of the complete vaccination in preventing infection was 18.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]:11.8–23.8%), and prevention of death was 66.0% (95% CI:60.6–70.7%). When comparing both vaccines, BNT162b2 and CoronaVac were effective in reducing infection and deaths associated with COVID-19. Nevertheless, the BNT162b2 vaccine had higher efficacy in preventing infection (42.6% vs. 15.0%) and deaths (90.4% vs. 64.8%) compared to CoronaVac. Conclusion: The results of our study suggest that vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in patients on chronic hemodialysis was effective in preventing infection and death associated with COVID-19.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1016/j.ekir.2022.07.007     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=24680249&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.ekir.2022.07.007&atitle=Clinical+Efficacy+of+SARS-CoV-2+Vaccination+in+Hemodialysis+Patients&stitle=Kidney+Intl.+Rep.&title=Kidney+International+Reports&volume=7&issue=10&spage=2176&epage=2185&aulast=Torres&aufirst=Rub%C3%A9n&auinit=R.&aufull=Torres+R.&coden=&isbn=&pages=2176-2185&date=2022&auinit1=R&auinitm=,bnt 162b 2;coronavac;tozinameran;adult;article;case fatality rate;Chile;cohort analysis;comparative effectiveness;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;death;drug efficacy;end stage renal disease;female;follow up;hemodialysis;hemodialysis patient;hospitalization;human;major clinical study;male;multicenter study;nonhuman;observational study;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;Renal Dialysis;Vaccination,,

The effects of COVID vaccination on KTRs are uncertain. We sought to better understand the clinical course, management, and outcomes of KTRs who developed COVID infection during the pre-and post-COVID vaccine rollout periods. We also compared whether there was a difference in patient outcomes or management of COVID infection between the two groups. Methods: This was a single-center study of KTRs who were infected with COVID. Baseline demographics, clinical parameters, COVID vaccination status, management, and outcomes were obtained by manual chart abstraction of the electronic medical records. Results: We studied a total of 134 KTRs in the pre-vaccination era and 83 KTRs after vaccination rollout who had COVID infections. The mean age of the patients was 54 years in both groups, and there was a greater proportion of African American KTRs in the pre-vaccination rollout era (70% vs. 53%, P=.02). No statistically significant differences were found among sex, BMI, or induction agents. In the pre-vaccination era, KTRs were more likely to present with fever (71% vs. 51%, P<.001). No statistically significant differences were observed in the onset of COVID infection after transplant, ICU admission, the requirement of mechanical ventilation therapy, incidence of AKI (acute kidney injury), requirement of renal replacement therapy (RRT), or incidence of acute rejection. For COVID infection management, KTRs in the post-vaccination rollout era were more likely to be treated with dexamethasone (47% vs. 32%, P=.035) . No statistically significant difference was found in the proportion of patients who required reduction or discontinuation of immunosuppressive agents. In the pre-vaccination era, KTRs were more likely to recover from acute kidney injury (57% vs, 25%, P=.01). No statistically significant difference was found in mortality between groups, but the risk of death was almost twice a high in the post-vaccination rollout era (21% vs. 12%). Conclusions: In this single-center case-control study, COVID vaccination rollout did not seem to have an appreciable impact on the incidence of hospitalization, ICU admission, AKI, RRT requirement, or mortality. Mortality risk among KTRs in the post-vaccination rollout era was almost twice as high as it was in the pre-vaccination rollout era, although there was no statistically significant difference, which might be due to low statistical power. The lack of improved outcomes of KTRs in the postvaccination rollout remains unclear. A combination of suboptimal immunogenic response to vaccination and the Delta variant surge could be a possibility.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1111/ajt.17073     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=16006143&id=doi:10.1111%2Fajt.17073&atitle=Comparison+of+Outcomes+and+Management+of+COVID+Infection+Among+Kidney+Transplant+Recipients+Between+Pre-Vaccination+Rollout+Era+and+Post-Vaccination+Rollout+Era&stitle=Am.+J.+Transplant.&title=American+Journal+of+Transplantation&volume=22&issue=&spage=1060&epage=&aulast=Uehara&aufirst=G.&auinit=G.&aufull=Uehara+G.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1060-&date=2022&auinit1=G&auinitm=,dexamethasone;immunosuppressive agent;SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;acute graft rejection;acute kidney failure;adult;African American;artificial ventilation;body mass;case control study;conference abstract;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;demographics;drug therapy;drug withdrawal;electronic medical record;female;fever;graft infection;hospitalization;human;incidence;kidney graft;major clinical study;male;middle aged;mortality;mortality risk;outcome assessment;renal replacement therapy;surgery;vaccination;Kidney Transplantation;Kidney;Vaccination,,

Dis.,2328-8957,9,,S759-S760,"Uy, A.V. and Llorin, R.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L640021442&from=export     U2  - L640021442,English,,"A.V. Uy, St. Luke's Medical Center, Quezon City, National Capital Region, Philippines","Background. Of the nine COVID-19 vaccines, the inactivated vaccine named CoronaVac, containing HB02 strain of SARS-CoV-2 created from Vero cells, created by the manufacturing company Sinovac was the first vaccine to arrive and be distributed in the Philippines, primarily in the private and government hospitals in Metro Manila. It is therefore important to determine the vaccine's effectiveness and safety among its recipients, including the frontline healthcare workers (HCWs). Methods. This was an observational cohort study which included HCWs from a tertiary hospital who have received one and/or two doses of CoronaVac from March 2021. The primary outcome of the study was to determine the clinical effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing risk of COVID-19 infection. The secondary outcome was the safety endpoint of the study vaccine. Results. Out of the 2954 CoronaVac vaccinees, a total of 368 HCWs have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. 146 (4.94%) recipients have been infected with COVID-19 after receiving their first dose, while 222 (7.51%) tested positive after the second dose. 179 recipients reported of adverse reactions following immunization, with majority of these HCWs experiencing minor symptoms. The relative risk for COVID-19 infection among those given was at 15.7%, indicating the clinical effectiveness of the said vaccine. Receiving CoronaVac vaccine will reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection by 84.3%. Table 3. Percentage of infected HCWs in SLMC-QC post-vaccination of CoronaVac Out of the 2954 CoronaVac vaccinees from SLMC, a total of 368 HCWs have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 after receiving either their first or second dose of CoronaVac vaccine from March to December 2021. 146 (4.94%) recipients have been infected with COVID-19 after receiving their first dose, while 222 (7.51%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after completing two doses of the inactivated vaccine (Table 3). Meanwhile, during the observation period after the 2nd dose of the vaccine, there were more reported cases of COVID-19. From a total of 222 (60.6%) COVID-19 confirmed cases after receiving their second dose of Sinovac, 33 were asymptomatic, while 176 recipients acquired mild infection and 12 participants had moderate COVID-19 infection. There was one case of severe COVID-19 and no cases of critical COVID-19 after completion of 2 doses among the HCWs (Figure 1). Based on this information, the researchers have computed for the relative risk (RR) for acquiring COVID-19 (Table 9). In the unvaccinated group, the risk for COVID-19 infection was reported at 79.5%, while the computed risk for COVID-19 among the treatment group, or those who received CoronaVac, was at 12.5%. Moreover, the relative risk for COVID-19 infection when given SINOVAC vaccine was at 15%, with relative risk reduction (RRR) of 84.3% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) 67% from baseline. Conclusion. CoronaVac vaccine is clinically effective in reducing the risk and severity of COVID-19 infection among HCWs in the study institution. Likewise, this inactivated vaccine can be safely given to individuals who are eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccine.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1093/ofid/ofac492.1550     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=23288957&id=doi:10.1093%2Fofid%2Fofac492.1550&atitle=Outcomes+of+the+adsorbed+Sinovac+CoronaVac+COVID-19+inactivated+vaccine+among+the+employee+recipients+in+St.+Luke%27s+Medical+Center+Quezon+City%3A+an+observational+cohort+study&stitle=Open+Forum+Infect.+Dis.&title=Open+Forum+Infectious+Diseases&volume=9&issue=&spage=S759&epage=S760&aulast=Uy&aufirst=Almira+V.&auinit=A.V.&aufull=Uy+A.V.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S759-S760&date=2022&auinit1=A&auinitm=V,coronavac;inactivated vaccine;adult;adverse drug reaction;cohort analysis;conference abstract;coronavirus disease 2019;drug safety;drug therapy;employee;female;health care personnel;human;human cell;immunization;major clinical study;male;nonhuman;outcome assessment;risk factor;risk reduction;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;side effect;tertiary care center;vaccination;vaccinee;Cohort Studies;Vaccination,,

Van Loon, Department of Medicine for Older People, Amsterdam UMC, Location Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands","Introduction: The COVID-19 booster vaccination was started in nursing homes (NH) from November 2021, and the omicron variant of the virus emerged. Yet, the effect of the booster on the disease course of COVID-19 was currently unknown. Therefore, we investigated the symptoms and risk of death after a COVID-19 infection in boosted NH residents and compared this group to NH residents without a booster or COVID-19 and to previous COVID-19 waves. Methods: Population-based longitudinal cohort study with electronic health record data. Data on vaccination status, age, gender, type of care, comorbidities, and date of death were extracted between 1 January and May 18, 2022. Risk of death and symptomatology of COVID-19 were compared between NH residents with a booster (Booster +) and without a booster (Booster-/+). Moreover, we compared the Booster + group with a group of residents where COVID- 19 was ruled out despite a clinical suspicion of COVID-19 (COVID- 19-). Finally, we compared our current results with previous waves of COVID-19. Results: Boosted NH residents (n = 3.149) had a milder disease course and symptomatology compared to the Booster-/+ group (n = 1.228) and previous waves of COVID-19. Only having a cold was more frequent in the Booster + group. Risk of death was much lower in the Booster + group (6%) than in the Booster-/+ group (12%), COVID-19- group (13%, n = 1.295) and previous waves (22%-42%). Key conclusions: Despite the omicron variant having a milder disease course, our results indicate that boostering of NH residents was still effective; boostering was characterized with milder symptomatology and lower mortality.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1007/s41999-022-00711-8     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18787657&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs41999-022-00711-8&atitle=Risk+of+death+and+symptomatology+of+COVID-19+in+nursing+home+residents+after+COVID-19+booster+vaccination&stitle=Eur.+Geriatr.+Med.&title=European+Geriatric+Medicine&volume=13&issue=&spage=S14&epage=&aulast=Van+Loon&aufirst=Anouk&auinit=A.&aufull=Van+Loon+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S14-&date=2022&auinit1=A&auinitm=,"adult;case report;clinical article;cohort analysis;cold stress;comorbidity;conference abstract;coronavirus disease 2019;date of death;electronic health record;female;gender;human;male;mortality;nursing home;nursing home patient;resident;revaccination;symptomatology;vaccination;Nursing Homes;Nurses, Community Health;Vaccination;Home Nursing;Vaccines",,

Veneti, Department of Infection Control and Preparedness, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Postboks 222 Skøyen, Oslo, Norway","Background: COVID-19 vaccination was recommended for adolescents in Norway since August 2021. In this population-based cohort study, we estimated the BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness against any PCR-confirmed (symptomatic or not) SARS-CoV-2 infections caused by the Delta and Omicron variant among adolescents (12-17-years-old) in Norway from August 2021 to January 2022. Methods: Using Cox proportional hazard models, we estimated the BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness against any Delta and Omicron infections. Vaccine status was included as a time-varying covariate and models were adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, county of residence, country of birth, and living conditions. Data were obtained from the National Preparedness registry for COVID-19, which contains individual-level data from national health and administrative registries. Findings: Vaccine effectiveness against Delta infection peaked at 68% (95%CI: 64–71%) and 62% (95%CI: 57–66%) in days 21-48 after the first dose among 12–15-year-olds and 16–17-year-olds respectively. Among 16–17-year-olds that received two doses, vaccine effectiveness peaked at 93% (95%CI: 90–95%) in days 35-62 and declined to 84% (95%CI: 76–89%) in 63 days or more after the second dose. For both age-groups, we found no protection against Omicron infection after receiving one dose. Among 16–17-year-olds, vaccine effectiveness against Omicron infection peaked at 53% (95%CI: 43–62%) in 7-34 days after the second dose and decreased to 23% (95%CI: 3–40%) in 63 days or more after vaccination. Vaccine effectiveness decreased with time since vaccination for both variants, but waning was observed to occur faster for Omicron. Interpretation: Our results suggest reduced protection from BNT162b2 vaccination against any SARS-CoV-2 infection caused by the Omicron variant compared to the Delta. In addition, waning immunity was observed to occur faster for Omicron. The impact of vaccination among adolescents on reducing infection and thus transmission is limited during omicron dominance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.03.24.22272854     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.03.24.22272854&atitle=Vaccine+effectiveness+with+BNT162b2+%28Comirnaty%2C+Pfizer-BioNTech%29+vaccine+against+reported+SARS-CoV-2+Delta+and+Omicron+infection+among+adolescents%2C+Norway%2C+August+2021+to+January+2022&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Veneti&aufirst=Lamprini&auinit=L.&aufull=Veneti+L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=L&auinitm=,adolescent;cohort analysis;comorbidity;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;female;groups by age;hepatitis D;human;immunity;male;nonhuman;Norway;public health;SARS-CoV-2 Delta;SARS-CoV-2 Omicron;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;variant of concern;tozinameran;Vaccination;Adolescent;Vaccines,,

Booster vaccines were offered starting from August 2021. Methods: The nationwide HUN-VE 3 study examined the effectiveness and durability of primary immunization and single booster vaccinations on SARS-CoV-2-related infection, hospitalization and mortality during the Delta wave. Results: The study population included 8,087,988 individuals aged 18–100 years at the beginning of the pandemic. During the Delta wave, after adjusting for age, sex, calendar day, and chronic diseases, vaccine effectiveness (VE) of primary vaccination against registered SARS-CoV-2 infection was between 11% to 77% and 18% to 79% 14–120 days after primary immunization in the 16–64 and 65–100 years age cohort respectively, while it decreased to close to zero in the younger age group and around 40% or somewhat less in the elderly after 6 months for almost all vaccine types. In the population aged 65–100 years, we found high, 88.1%–92.5% adjusted effectiveness against Covid-19 infection after the Pfizer-BioNTech, and 92.2%–95.6% after the Moderna booster dose, while Sinopharm and Janssen booster doses provided 26.5%–75.3% and 72.9%–100.0% adjusted VE, respectively. Adjusted VE against Covid-19 related hospitalization was high within 14–120 days for Pfizer-BioNTech: 76.6%, Moderna: 83.8%, Sputnik-V: 78.3%, AstraZeneca: 73.8%, while modest for Sinopharm: 45.7% and Janssen: 26.4%. The waning of protection against Covid-19 related hospitalization was modest and booster vaccination with mRNA vaccines or the Janssen vaccine increased adjusted VE up to almost 100%, while the Sinopharm booster dose proved to be less effective. VE against Covid-19 related death after primary immunization was high or moderate: for Pfizer-BioNTech: 81.5%, Moderna: 93.2%, Sputnik-V: 100.0%, AstraZeneca: 84.8%, Sinopharm: 58.6%, Janssen: 53.3%). VE against this outcome also showed moderate decline over time, while booster vaccines restored effectiveness up to almost 100%, except for the Sinopharm booster. Conclusions: The HUN-VE 3 study demonstrated waning VE with all vaccine types for all examined outcomes during the Delta wave and confirmed the outstanding benefit of booster vaccination with the mRNA or Janssen vaccines. This is the first study to provide comparable effectiveness results for six different booster types during the Delta pandemic wave.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.04.14.22273898     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.04.14.22273898&atitle=Effectiveness+and+waning+of+protection+with+different+SARS-CoV-2+primary+and+booster+vaccines+during+the+Delta+pandemic+wave+in+2021+in+Hungary+%28HUN-VE+3+study%29&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Vok%C3%B3&aufirst=Zolt%C3%A1n&auinit=Z.&aufull=Vok%C3%B3+Z.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=Z&auinitm=,adult;aged;chronic disease;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;delta rhythm;drug therapy;female;groups by age;hospitalization;human;Hungary;immunization;major clinical study;male;mortality;multicenter study;nonhuman;pandemic;revaccination;SARS-CoV-2 Delta;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;young adult;ibacovavec;messenger RNA;RNA vaccine;sputnik v vaccine;Vaccination,,

Meredith, Department of Public and Ecosystem Health, Cornell University, College of Veterinary Medicine, Ithaca, NY, United States","Background: While booster vaccinations clearly reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 and death, the impact of boosters on SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been fully characterized: doing so requires understanding their impact on asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic infections that often go unreported but nevertheless play an important role in spreading SARS-CoV-2. We sought to estimate the impact of COVID-19 booster doses on SARS-CoV-2 infection in a vaccinated population of young adults during an Omicron BA.1-predominant period. Methods and Findings: We implemented a cohort study of young adults in a college environment (Cornell University’s Ithaca campus) from a period when Omicron BA.1 was the predominant SARSCoV-2 variant on campus (December 5 to December 31, 2021). Participants included 15,800 university students who completed an initial vaccination series with a vaccine approved by the World Health Organization for emergency use, were enrolled in mandatory at-least-weekly surveillance PCR testing, and had no positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test within 90 days before the start of the study period. Robust multivariable Poisson regression with the main outcome of a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test was performed to compare those who completed their initial vaccination series and a booster dose to those without a booster dose. 1,926 unique SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified in the study population. Controlling for sex, student group membership, date of completion of initial vaccination series, initial vaccine type, and temporal effect during the study period, our analysis estimates that receiving a booster dose further reduces the rate of having a PCR-detected SARS-CoV-2 infection relative to an initial vaccination series by 56% (95% confidence interval [42%, 67%], P <0.001). While most individuals had recent booster administration before or during the study period (a limitation of our study), this result is robust to the assumed delay over which a booster dose becomes effective (varied from 1 day to 14 days). The mandatory active surveillance approach used in this study, under which 86% of the person-days in the study occurred, reduces the likelihood of outcome mis-classification. Key limitations of our methodology are that we did not have an a priori protocol or statistical analysis plan because the analysis was initially done for institutional research purposes, and some analysis choices were made after observing the data. Conclusions: We observed that boosters are effective, relative to completion of initial vaccination series, in further reducing the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections in a college student population during a period when Omicron BA.1 was predominant; booster vaccinations for this age group may play an important role in reducing incidence of COVID-19.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1101/2022.03.08.22272056     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.03.08.22272056&atitle=Booster+vaccination+protection+against+SARS-CoV-2+infections+in+young+adults+during+an+Omicron+BA.1-predominant+period%3A+a+retrospective+cohort+study&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Wan&aufirst=Jiayue&auinit=J.&aufull=Wan+J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=J&auinitm=,adult;cohort analysis;college student;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;female;gender;groups by age;human;major clinical study;male;nonhuman;revaccination;sensitivity analysis;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;university student;vaccination;young adult;ibacovavec;elasomeran;tozinameran;Cohort Studies;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

Methods: In this population-based analysis, we used a test-negative design across four immune-mediated inflammatory disease population-based cohorts, comprising individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease. We identified all SARS-CoV-2 tests done in these populations between March 1 and Nov 22, 2021 (a period in which there was rapid uptake of vaccines, and the alpha [B.1.1.7] and delta [B.1.617.2] SARS-CoV-2 variants were predominantly circulating in Canada) and separately assessed outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes (hospitalisation due to COVID-19 and death due to COVID-19) for each disease group. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the effectiveness of one, two, and three doses of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 [Pfizer–BioNTech], or mRNA-1273 [Moderna]) among individuals at the time of SARS-CoV-2 testing.

Adjusted vaccine effectiveness of two doses against infection was 83% (95% CI 80–86) in those with rheumatoid arthritis, 89% (83–93) among those with ankylosing spondylitis, 84% (81–86) among those with psoriasis, and 79% (74–82) among those with inflammatory bowel disease. After two vaccine doses, effectiveness against infection generally peaked 31–60 days after vaccination and waned gradually with each additional month. Vaccine effectiveness against severe outcomes after two doses was 92% (95% CI 88–95) in those with rheumatoid arthritis, 97% (83–99) among those with ankylosing spondylitis, 92% (86–95) among those with psoriasis, and 94% (88–97) among those with inflammatory bowel disease. Vaccine effectiveness after a third dose against infection was similar to or higher than after the second dose (ranging from 76% [47–89] to 96% [72–99]), although due to a paucity of events, estimates could not be calculated for some subgroups for severe outcomes. Interpretation: Two vaccine doses were found to be highly effective against both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease during the study period. Research is needed to determine the durability of effectiveness of three doses over time, particularly against emerging variants.

This retrospective cohort study in the US national Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system reports the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in cancer patients on and off active therapy during the first 140 days following administration. Methods: This is a multicenter study of SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinated and unvaccinated Veterans vaccinated during the period from 12/15/2020 to 5/4/2021. Veterans with solid or hematologic malignancy who received systemic cancer-directed therapy at the VA at least one time between 8/15/2010 to 5/4/2021 were included. Vaccinated patients were exactly matched 1:1 to an unvaccinated control on race, VA facility, rurality of home address, cancer type, and treatment timing and modality with minimum distance matching on age. The primary exposure was receipt of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination effectiveness was defined as 1 minus the risk ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection for vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated controls. Results: 184,485 patients met eligibility criteria and 113,796 were vaccinated during the study period. Of these, 29,152 vaccinated patients were matched 1:1 to 29,152 unvaccinated or not yet vaccinated controls. As of a median 47 days of follow-up, overall vaccine effectiveness in the matched cohort was 58% (95% CI, 39 to 72%) starting 14 days after the second dose. Patients on chemotherapy within three months prior to first vaccination dose exhibited a 14-day post-second dose effectiveness of 57% (95% CI -23 to 90%), versus 76% (95% CI 50 to 91%) for those on endocrine therapy and 85% (95% CI 29 to 100%) for those off systemic therapy for at least six months prior. Conclusions: Vaccination is an effective strategy for preventing COVID-19 in cancer patients. However, effectiveness may be reduced in patients actively receiving immunosuppressive systemic therapy. Future study is needed to determine if these patients would benefit from post-vaccination serologies and/or a booster vaccination following completion of therapy.

Yassi, UBC, 430-2206 East Mall, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Background: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues and new variants such as Omicron emerge, we aimed to re-evaluate vaccine effectiveness as well as impacts of rigorously implemented infection control, public health and occupational health measures in protecting healthcare workers (HCWs). Methods: Following a cohort of 21,242 HCWs in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, for 20 months since the pandemic started, we used Cox regression and test-negative-design to examine differences in SARS-COV-2 infection rates compared to community counterparts, and within the HCW workforce, assessing the role of occupation, testing accessibility, vaccination rates, and vaccine effectiveness over time. Results: Nurses, allied health professionals and medical staff in this jurisdiction had a significantly lower rate of infection compared to their age-group community counterparts, at 47.4, 41.8, and 55.3% reduction respectively; controlling for vaccine-attributable reductions, the protective impact was still substantial, at 33.4, 28.0, and 36.5% respectively. Licensed practical nurses and care aides had the highest risk of infection among HCWs, more than double that of medical staff. However, even considering differences in vaccination rates, no increase in SARSCoV-2 infection was found compared to community rates, with combined protective measures beyond vaccination associated with a 17.7% reduced SARS-COV-2 rate in the VCH workforce overall. There was also no evidence of waning immunity within at least 200 days after second dose. Conclusion: Rigorously implemented occupational health, public health and infection control measures results in a well-protected healthcare workforce with infection rates at or below rates in community counterparts. Greater accessibility of vaccination worldwide is essential; however, as implementing measures to protect this workforce globally also requires considerable health system strengthening in many jurisdictions, we caution against overly focusing on vaccination to the exclusion of other crucial elements for wider protection of HCWs, especially in facing ongoing mutations which may escape current vaccines.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1101/2021.12.02.21267190     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2021.12.02.21267190&atitle=Healthcare+worker+risk+of+COVID-19%3A+A+20-month+analysis+of+protective+measures+from+vaccination+and+beyond&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Yassi&aufirst=Annalee&auinit=A.&aufull=Yassi+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2021&auinit1=A&auinitm=,British Columbia;cohort analysis;comparative effectiveness;controlled study;drug therapy;groups by age;health care personnel;health workforce;human;immunity;infection control;infection rate;licensed practical nurse;medical staff;nonhuman;pandemic;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;vaccine;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

Patients included in this study were largely 65 years or older (62,834, 55%), male (101,259, 88%), and non-Hispanic white (66,986, 58%). Methods: We used SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test results to conduct a matched test-negative case-control study to estimate VE of three and two doses of mRNA vaccines against infection (regardless of symptoms), and a matched case-control study to estimate VE against COVID-19related hospitalization and death. We estimated VE as (1- odds ratio) x 100%. Severity of disease was measured using hospital length of stay (LOS) and admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Results: Against infection, booster doses had 7-times higher VE - 59% (95% confidence interval [CI], 57 to 61) - than 2-dose VE (7%; 95% CI, 3 to 10) during the Omicron period. For the Delta period, estimated VE against infection was 90% (95% CI, 88 to 92) among boosted vaccinees, 64% higher than VE among 2-dose vaccinees [55% (95% CI, 51 to 58)]. Against hospitalization, booster dose VE was 87% (95% CI, 80 to 91) during Omicron and 95% (95% CI, 91 to 97) during Delta; the 2-dose VE was 44% (95% CI, 26 to 58) during Omicron and 75% (95% CI, 70 to 80) during Delta. Against death, estimated VE with a booster dose was 94% (95% CI, 85 to 98) during Omicron and 96% (95% CI, 88 to 99) during Delta, while the 2-dose VE was 75% (95% CI, 52 to 87) during Omicron and 93% (95% CI, 85 to 97) during Delta. During the Omicron period, average hospital LOS was 4 days shorter [3 days (95%CI, 3 to 4 days)] than during the Delta period. Conclusions: A mRNA vaccine booster is more effective against infection, hospitalization, and death than 2-dose vaccination among an older male population with comorbidities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: test-negative",10.1101/2022.01.15.22269360     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.01.15.22269360&atitle=Effectiveness+of+mRNA+COVID-19+Booster+Vaccines+against+Omicron+and+Delta+Variants+among+US+Veterans&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Young-Xu&aufirst=Yinong&auinit=Y.&aufull=Young-Xu+Y.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=Y&auinitm=,"adult;case control study;comorbidity;comparative effectiveness;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;female;hospitalization;human;intensive care unit;laboratory test;length of stay;male;nonhuman;SARS-CoV-2 Delta;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;vaccinee;veteran;messenger RNA;RNA vaccine;Vaccination;RNA, Messenger;Veterans;Vaccines",,

There is a relative paucity of data regarding its effectiveness in the prevention of asymptomatic infection. Methods: In this real-world observational study, we identified a subpopulation of individuals in a large health maintenance organization who were repeatedly tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We included these individuals in the study cohort and compared those who were vaccinated with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to unvaccinated individuals. A positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result was used as the outcome. The follow-up period was from January 1, 2021, until February 11, 2021. Results: A total of 6286 individuals were included in the cohort. Seven days after the second vaccine dose, a rate of 6 positive PCR tests per 10 000 person-days was recorded, compared with a rate of 53 positive tests per 10 000 person-days for the unvaccinated group. The estimated vaccine effectiveness against infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus after 2 vaccine doses was 89% (95% CI, 82%-94%). The estimated effectiveness 2 weeks after the first vaccine dose was 61% (95% CI, 49%-71%). Conclusions: In this study, vaccination with BNT162b2 reduced infection rates among individuals who underwent screening by frequent SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Using a cohort of frequently tested individuals reduced the indication bias for the PCR testing, which enabled estimation of infection rates.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1093/ofid/ofab262     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=23288957&id=doi:10.1093%2Fofid%2Fofab262&atitle=BNT162b2+Vaccine+Effectiveness+in+Preventing+Asymptomatic+Infection+With+SARS-CoV-2+Virus%3A+A+Nationwide+Historical+Cohort+Study&stitle=Open+Forum+Infect.+Dis.&title=Open+Forum+Infectious+Diseases&volume=8&issue=6&spage=&epage=&aulast=Zacay&aufirst=Galia&auinit=G.&aufull=Zacay+G.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2021&auinit1=G&auinitm=,adult;article;asymptomatic infection;cohort analysis;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;female;follow up;gene amplification;health maintenance organization;human;indication bias;infection rate;major clinical study;male;multicenter study;nonhuman;observational study;polymerase chain reaction;prevention;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;vaccination;RNA vaccine;tozinameran;Cohort Studies;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

However, pregnant people were not included in pivotal phase III COVID-19 vaccine efficacy trials. Methods. We used Cox regression models in a cohort study to determine hazard ratios (HR) of a PCR positive test (“infection”) comparing vaccinated with unvaccinated pregnant persons in Kaiser Permanente Northern California. HRs were adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, type of insurance coverage, geographical area, BMI, preexisting diabetes, hypertension, parity, time since pregnancy onset and smoking status. Vaccine effectiveness (VE), calculated as 1 minus adjusted HR, was estimated for fully vaccinated < 150 and ≥ 150 days prior to infection. VE was estimated for before and during Delta, and Omicron. We also calculated incidence rates of COVID-pneumonia associated hospitalization by vaccination status. Results. Among 68836 pregnancies between 12/15/2020 and 3/31/2022, 21834 (31.7%) were fully vaccinated and 5980 (8.7%) were boosted by the end of pregnancy. Compared with unvaccinated persons, the HRs of infection for fully vaccinated < 150 days prior were 0.13 (95% CI: 0.07 - 0.23; VE=87% [77% - 93%]) before Delta; 0.25 (CI: 0.20 - 0.30; VE=75% [70% - 80%]) during Delta and 0.76 (CI: 0.61 - 0.94; VE= 24% [16% - 39%]) during Omicron. The HRs for ≥ 150 days prior were 0.38 (CI: 0.31 - 0.46; VE=62 % [54% - 69%]) during Delta and 1.04 (CI: 0.89 - 1.22; VE= -0.04% [-0.22% - 0.11%]) during Omicron. The HRs for boosted persons were 0.10 (CI: 0.04 - 0.25; VE= 90% [75% - 96%]) during Delta and 0.42 (CI: 0.34 - 0.52; VE=58% [48% - 66%]) during Omicron periods. Incidence rates (IR) per 1000 person-years for hospitalization before delta were 0.75 among unvaccinated and zero among vaccinated. During Delta, the IR was 6.64 for unvaccinated and zero for fully vaccinated and boosted. During Omicron, the IR was 10.27 for unvaccinated, zero for fully vaccinated < 150 days prior, 2.48 for fully vaccinated ≥ 150 days prior and zero for those boosted. Conclusion. COVID-19 vaccines protect against infection and hospitalization among pregnant people. However, vaccine effectiveness against infection wanes over time and was lower during Omicron. Booster doses are necessary for continuous protection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1093/ofid/ofac492.135     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=23288957&id=doi:10.1093%2Fofid%2Fofac492.135&atitle=COVID-19+Vaccine+Effectiveness+Among+Pregnant+People&stitle=Open+Forum+Infect.+Dis.&title=Open+Forum+Infectious+Diseases&volume=9&issue=&spage=S76&epage=&aulast=Zerbo&aufirst=Ousseny&auinit=O.&aufull=Zerbo+O.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S76-&date=2022&auinit1=O&auinitm=,SARS-CoV-2 vaccine;adult;body mass;California;clinical trial;cohort analysis;conference abstract;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;diabetes mellitus;drug therapy;ethnicity;female;hospitalization;human;hypertension;incidence;insurance;major clinical study;parity;people by smoking status;phase 3 clinical trial;pneumonia;pregnancy;principal component regression;race;vaccination;Vaccination;Vaccines,,

Relative to their baseline protection waned overtime against infections for BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 and against hospitalisations for BNT162b2. No waning of baseline protection was observed at any time for ICU admissions for all three vaccines. Calculated baseline VE was consistent with the published literature. Interpretation: While the starting protection level provided by the primary series may differ by vaccine type and mechanism of action, this study demonstrated by comparing each vaccine to its own baseline protection that the three vaccines in three separate populations may have different durability profiles. Further investigation is required to fully characterize the durability profile of the three vaccines. Moreover, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, and as more countries and populations implement a standard of care consisting of three doses of the mRNA vaccines or two doses of Ad26.COV2.S, further investigation is critical to understand the level of protection and the durability of response over longer periods, novel variants and in response to homologous and heterologous boosting.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: case-control",10.1101/2022.01.05.22268648     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=&id=doi:10.1101%2F2022.01.05.22268648&atitle=Durability+of+protection+post-primary+COVID-19+vaccination+in+the+US%3A+Matched+case-control+study&stitle=medRxiv&title=medRxiv&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Zheutlin&aufirst=Amanda&auinit=A.&aufull=Zheutlin+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=A&auinitm=,adult;breakthrough infection;case control study;cellular immunity;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;female;hospitalization;human;intensive care unit;low drug dose;male;United States;vaccination;ibacovavec;elasomeran;RNA vaccine;tozinameran;Case-Control Studies;Vaccination,,

Ziv, Pediatrics, MEIR HOSPITAL, Kfar Saba, Israel","Introduction: The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for adolescents with juvenile-onset autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) is unknown. Several studies suggest attenuated immunogenicity in patients with AIIRD. Objectives: This study evaluated the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in preventing COVID-19 infection in adolescents with juvenile-onset AIIRD compared to healthy controls. Methods: We used data from Clalit Health Services, the largest healthcare organization in Israel, to conduct an observational cohort study from June to December 2021, involving adolescents ages 12-18 years, diagnosed with AIIRD. Study outcomes included documented COVID-19 infection in relation to vaccination status and immunomodulatory therapy. We estimated vaccine effectiveness as one minus the risk ratio. Healthy adolescents in the same age group served as controls. Results: A total of 1,639 adolescents with AIIRD (juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or familial Mediterranean fever) were included and compared to 524,471 adolescents in the same age range. There was no difference in COVID-19 infection rates after the second dose of vaccine for those with AIIRD and healthy controls (2.1% vs. 2.1% respectively, p=0.99). The estimated vaccine effectiveness for adolescents with AIIRD was 76.3% after the first dose, 94.8% after the second and 99.2% after the third dose. Conclusion: We found that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is highly effective against COVID-19 in adolescents with AIIRD, similar to healthy controls. Immunomodulatory therapy did not affect its effectiveness. These results can encourage adolescents with AIIRD to get vaccinated against COVID-19.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Sabir""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: cohort",10.1186/s12969-022-00729-z     LK  - http://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15460096&id=doi:10.1186%2Fs12969-022-00729-z&atitle=Effectiveness+of+the+BNT162B2+MRNA+COVID-19+vaccine+in+adolescents+with+juvenile-onset+autoimmune+inflammatory+rheumatic+diseases&stitle=Pediatr.+Rheumatol.&title=Pediatric+Rheumatology&volume=20&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Ziv&aufirst=A.&auinit=A.&aufull=Ziv+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=A&auinitm=,"RNA vaccine;tozinameran;adolescent;adult;child;cohort analysis;comparative effectiveness;conference abstract;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug therapy;familial Mediterranean fever;female;health care organization;health service;human;immunotherapy;infection rate;Israel;juvenile rheumatoid arthritis;major clinical study;male;outcome assessment;prevention;rheumatic disease;risk assessment;school child;systemic lupus erythematosus;vaccination;Adolescent;Rheumatic Diseases;Vaccination;RNA, Messenger",,
